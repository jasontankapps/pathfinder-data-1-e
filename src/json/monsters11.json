			"",
			"**Compulsive Hunger (Ex)** Despite being undead, a gaki is plagued by an insatiable hunger, and believes it can gain a normal body or rest in peace if it consumes the right mixture of flesh, food, and drink. A gaki that finds a corpse or is offered food, wine, holy water, or flowers must succeed at a DC 20 Will save or spend one turn trying to grab and consume it. Its narrow neck prevents it from swallowing more than a tiny amount, and it gives up after 1 round of attempting to do so. A gaki that consumes holy water in this way is not harmed by it.",
			"",
			"#### Description",
			"",
			"When an especially jealous or greedy evil person dies, it sometimes returns as a gaki-a misshapen creature with a supernatural hunger for things of the material world. Mistakenly called \"hungry ghosts\" because of their ability to fly and turn invisible, gakis believe that if they consume the right material-typically meat, wine, blood, flowers, and souls-they can form a new body resembling their former mortal shapes. Its long, thin neck restricts how much it can eat, and the creature is perpetually starving. It prefers to consume evil creatures, believing it gains more sustenance from a sinful being than a righteous one, but it won't pass up any mortal flesh. Some gakis believe they must consume flesh from demons or undead, and fixate on these creatures to the aversion of all others.",
			"",
			"Gakis are cursed, pitiable creatures with nothing to lose, which makes them very dangerous. Some that have existed for many years as undead grow desperate and try consuming earth, sewage, or more vile substances in an attempt to find the missing ingredient for their transformation. Particularly unfortunate ones bear an onerous curse that causes anything they try to eat to burst into flame or wither away into dust.",
			"",
			"These creatures have short memories and little sense of perspective. They're smart enough to pursue what they want cannily, but fail at making long-term plans. Most gakis wander alone, pursuing their search for nourishment in solitude. When they do form packs, they use their numbers to surround and bring down large animals or groups of people, but then throw cooperation aside to squabble and shove as each one greedily tries to claim the entire prize They've taken.",
			"",
			"Strangely, gakis are scorched by moonlight and frozen by sunlight. Because of this, they're forced to lurk in the shadows of ruins. Some wander the deep caves and tunnels below the surface, scrounging whatever meals they can find. In urban areas, they group together to stalk the slums, often leaping upon victims, tearing away small morsels of flesh before they retreat, leaving victims bleeding and disoriented. They find hiding places' often in abandoned buildings or sewers' to stay during the day, turning invisible and biding their time till the dark of night comes."

			"**Baleful Gust (Su)** Three times per day as a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunities, a gale spirit can whip the wind around it into a terrible, howling gust. This baleful gust lasts for 1 round, and creatures and objects within a 15-foot radius of the gale spirit are affected as if by a gust of wind. Additionally, when the gust begins, the howling winds deal 4d6 points of sonic damage to creatures in the area.

			"",
			"Gale spirits are the remnants of wicked individuals who have fallen a great distance through the air-usually from bridges or mountainsides-and died alone, broken on the ground, while cursing the world for leaving them to their terrible demise. These malicious creatures haunt the places of their deaths, hungrily seeking victims with whom they can share their fate. Although they are not typically friendly with any creatures, even others of their kind, gale spirits do occasionally work with each other in combat; the result is often a terrible, haunted place of howling winds and spooky terrain that is as unnerving as it is deadly.",
			"",
			"Gale spirits resemble 2-foot-tall, disembodied heads with twisted features that are eerily similar to those the creatures had in life.",
			"",
			"Gale spirits' facial features are the only physical remnants of the individuals they once were. Each gale spirit is still recognizable to those who knew the creature while it lived, even though the undead horror's seething rage twists its features into something unnatural. A cold blue glow emanates from its translucent face, and wisps of spirit essence trail behind it. Whirling winds typically following the spirit, leaving undulating patterns on the ground as it passes above. This wind screams louder and louder when the gale spirit circles in preparation for a fight, sounding like a gust mixed with screams of agony. Sometimes, gale spirits that had personal ties to the creatures they are attacking convey taunting or tormenting words along with their gales, but more often than not, gale spirits merely scream and howl unintelligibly as they descend upon their victims.",
			"",
			"A gale spirit retains some of its former personality, though the murderous rage that plagues its mind greatly warps its outlook. Even when it's not attacking, it is capable of speech, though it hardly ever sees any reason for conversation when it comes to the living. A gale spirit rarely has any goals beyond visiting suffering upon others; in this way, gale spirits make their own tortured existence more bearable. If a gale spirit can still feel any measure of happiness, it is only when it is staring at the broken bodies of multiple victims of its whipping winds, waiting for them to rise as its spawn.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"Throughout Golarion, there are deadly drops with particularly ominous reputations: bridges that cross deep canyons, thin paths atop sheer cliffs, abandoned manors built on mountains, and waterfalls hundreds of feet tall. Some of these places are tied to myths about specific villainous individuals who fell to their deaths there; less commonly known, however, is that many of these myths are actually origin stories for the gale spirits that haunt these areas. Some even say that gale spirits take pride in residing in places with particularly dangerous reputations, and that they sometimes purposely leave straggling survivors to ensure that their malevolent reputations continue to grow. However, it's unclear whether such pride is characteristic of gale spirits in general, or if individual spirits simply embody the trait.",
			"",
			"Often, such a haunted place's dangerous reputation stems from these angry spirits' activities rather than the natural danger its geography presents. After a gale spirit begins to haunt a place, bodies are often found on these places' precipices rather than solely at their bases. Strangely, although it seems impossible for these victims to have fallen to their deaths, the ground surrounding each of these bodies appears to be a point of great impact.",
			"",
			"Though a gale spirit's spawn tend to haunt the same areas as their progenitor, sometimes forming ravenous packs with their creator, gale spirits usually ignore others of their kind. The exception is typically in combat, when gale spirits sometimes join forces to try to destroy as many living creatures as possible. In places where their numbers have swelled, gale spirits tend to become more communicative. If a traveler listens closely enough, words are audible along with the constantly howling wind up to a mile away. Such phrases are almost always terrible threats or macabre boasts, spoken in Common in a chorus of eerie, barely discernible voices.",
			"",
			"Gale spirits are most common in rural areas, particularly in mountainous terrain or in forests with extreme elevation differences. They are found in all climates and wander their territories at all times of day, although they tend to avoid bright daylight, which makes it hard for them to see. For this reason, gale spirits attacks are most common at night. Darkness offers them cover from which to surprise victims, kill them, and turn them into hateful progeny. Gale spirits and their packs thrive best in secluded areas that nonetheless have regular foot traffic, which provides them with a slow but steady influx of potential victims. Nearly forgotten religious shrines or abandoned temples of minor deities with dangerous precipices nearby are choice hunting grounds for a gale spirit or two. Although it's uncommon, some particularly old gale spirits even roam from the sites of their mortal death to other, more dangerous or notorious places that are better suited to attracting victims. Even then, a gale spirit rarely changes its lair more than once in a hundred years.",
			"",
			"With its wide swaths of rural, mountainous areas - not to mention its preponderance of villainous individuals since House Thrune seized control of the nation - Cheliax is home to a large number of gale spirits. The northern Menador Mountains, as the location of many evildoers' hideouts over the years, have been a particular hotbed for the creatures. Some of Cheliax's more active gale spirits have even been known to venture forth from the mountains onto the plains north of the Barrowood and Whisperwood. Rumors hold that, outside of towns such as Kantaria, the howling of the winds on stormy nights is not a simple weather phenomenon but a chorus of angry gale spirits looking for new victims. An old folktale even tells of murderous triplets from Kantaria who supposedly committed suicide together by jumping off a bluff in the northern Whisperwood rather than face judgment for their crimes. It's said that the siblings joined together to form a massive, supremely deadly gale spirit that actively tries to lure unhappy citizens from Kantaria into the woods. Such stories are often told to scare children into behaving well, but scholars believe there might actually be some truth to them, and that certain gale spirits with such terrible origins might be far more powerful than those born from lone deaths.",
			"",
			"Varisia, with its massive Storval Rise and towering Thassilonian ruins, is also a gale spirit hotbed. Scholars posit that Varisia is home to some of the oldest gale spirits in the Inner Sea region, and that some existing in the most rural locales may even have been Thassilonian slave masters. In the wilds outside of Magnimar, it is also rumored that there are a handful of gale spirits that are friendlier to mortals than others of their kind. These gale spirits are said to work with living partners-supposedly individuals who knew the gale spirits while they lived-to lure unsuspecting victims to their territories, where the gale spirits brutally murder them. These gale spirits supposedly have tribes of progeny that number a dozen or more. Their aims in building these tribes-and whether they are under the influence of even more sinister forces-are unclear."

If confronted, a galluvix defends itself with a shrieking magical bark and then flees.

A galluvix often rewards these individuals with the gift of a magical egg.",

Deciding to teach the fledgling humans a lesson - or at least play a fantastic joke - these fey tricksters introduced galluvixes into their midst: magical crossbreeds of fox and fowl that had an easy time mingling with and then devouring the humans' flocks. To these First World tricksters, the experiment was a success, and although the fey quickly lost interest in their voracious creations, galluvixes have since spread wherever unwary farmers leave their hens unguarded.",
			"",
			"Galluvixes are predators that use their ability to adopt a fully avian appearance to get close to unwary prey. Their natural stealth and other magical talents aid them in slipping into farmsteads and sneaking past watchdogs. Skittish and somewhat cowardly, galluvixes usually prefer to flee from serious threats, flashing their rooster-like tails as they depart, which makes them hard to target. When alarmed or cornered, galluvixes let loose with screeching barks, laced with sonic force, that deter all but the most determined pursuers.",
			"",
			"The galluvix's most unusual talent is its ability to vanish into the First World to search for a magical spell, which it retrieves in a vessel known as a trickster's egg. Sages debate whether this was a happy accident or a trait bred into the fox-fowl by fey who wanted magical aid in their occasional battles against human encroachment. Theories also abound about whether galluvixes fetch these eggs from their own hidden supplies or steal them from one of the First World demigods, the Eldest; no galluvix will speak of the process.",

Some galluvixes have been said to live close to 150 years, though whether this increased age is natural or the result of strange magic is unclear. While its fox fur grows more grizzled and its lustrous feathers fade with age, a galluvix retains an excellent memory of all that has transpired in its territory. Galluvixes in a region with plenty of action and intrigue can become a valuable source of information to adventurers who know where to look and don't dismiss the intelligence of these creatures.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"Galluvixes tend to live on the outskirts of farming communities or in lightly wooded areas with plenty of game. However, they are adaptable creatures that can make do in wild or urban settings on almost any continent. Their ability to take the form of foxes or fowl allows them to blend into a myriad of locations.",
			"",
			"In the Inner Sea region, they are most common near the Verduran Forest in Andoran and Taldor, in and around Qadira's Tapur Forest, and throughout Sargava and Varisia. Farmers and woodsfolk in these lands generally regard galluvixes as nuisances, though with some degree of tolerance. On the other hand, citizens of more hardscrabble lands, such as Irrisen and Nirmathas, see galluvixes as threats to their livelihood and no better than wicked fey.",
			"",
			"Despite their deceptive hunting practices, galluvixes are otherwise companionable, loyal creatures. They often mate for life, each pair digging a den to share. Once a year, a female galluvix lays a clutch of three to six eggs, with both parents taking turns to sit on the nest and raise the kits when they hatch. Kits remain with their parents for the first year of life, and it is their curiosity that is responsible for the shiny coins and baubles occasionally found in galluvix dens.",
			"",
			"Humanoids who overcome a galluvix's instinctive wariness find it fond of conversation and gossip. Often these conversations blossom into true friendships, and it is such favored folk (especially those who have fallen on hard times) who most often receive a trickster's egg containing a curative boon.",
			"",
			"Because of their intelligent natures, it is difficult to truly tame galluvixes. Nevertheless, some entrepreneurs have tried. The most successful galluvix breeders employ a combination of flattery, magical compulsion, and regular offerings of extravagant meals. Individual breeders consider these regimens to be trade secrets, which often leads them to treat one another with great animosity and suspicion.",
			"",
			"Galluvixes get along with most fey, particularly playful [pixies](monster/pixie), jovial [grigs](monster/grig), and any liminal [sprites](monster/sprite) within their territories. They find [brownies](monster/brownie) to be stuffy and overprotective of the farms in their care, and particularly watchful over chicken coops. Galluvixes revile [gnolls](monster/gnoll), [goblins](monster/goblin), and [gremlins](family/gremlin) for their destructive ways-after all, when a farm is despoiled, not only humans go hungry-and they bear a special hatred for pugwampis, insulting them in fluent Undercommon.",
			"",
			"A spellcaster can gain a galluvix as a familiar at 7th level by taking the [Improved Familiar](feat/improved_familiar) feat. The resulting arcane bond allows the spellcaster to direct the galluvix in the use of its trickster's egg ability. Also, when using that ability, a galluvix familiar can return to an unoccupied space next to its master instead of the spot where it vanished."

These spikes impale nearby creatures, dealing 6d6 points of piercing damage to each creature adjacent to the gammenore (Reflex DC 19 half). Additionally, the spikes shatter easily, embedding shards of ice in the flesh of creatures that fail their saving throws against the attack-these shards deal 1d6 points of bleed damage each round until the wounds are healed. A gammenore can use this ability once every 1d4 rounds. The save DC is Constitution-based.",
			"",
			"**Oversized Pincer (Ex)** A gammenore's pincer attack is a primary attack that deals the indicated amount of damage plus 1-1/2 times its Strength modifier.",
			"",
			"**Shell of Ice (Su)** Much of a gammenore's carapace is encased in a thick layer of jagged icicles. This shell of ice functions much like spiked armor, dealing 1d8 points of piercing damage to the target of any successful grapple combat maneuver check made by the gammenore. ",
			"",
			"Additionally, this frozen shell helps to regulate the gammenore's cold body temperature, granting it resistance 10 to fire. The shell can absorb up to 60 points of fire damage before melting. Once the shell melts, the gammenore takes a -4 penalty to its natural armor bonus, it loses its fire resistance, and it deals no additional damage when grappling. A gammenore can reconstitute a melted shell by spending time in areas of intense cold. This process takes 2 hours in a cold environment, 3d10 minutes in areas of severe cold, and 1d10 minutes in areas of extreme cold.",
			"",
			"#### Description",
			"",
			"The gammenore is a prime example of how Triaxian fauna has adapted to survive the planet's long, cruel winters. While other creatures struggle to survive the planet's decades-long season of cold and ice, the gammenore thrives, turning the might of winter into the very tools of its survival.",
			"",
			"Absent its icy armor, the gammenore looks like a large, blue-and-white-shelled crustacean. It has a rather wide, oval-shaped carapace, a pair of powerful pincers, and four pairs of strong, articulated legs.",
			"",
			"A gammenore's two pincers serve very different purposes. The primary claw is monstrously large and extremely strong, and is used to break through ice and crush the gammenore's prey. The other claw is smaller, less cumbersome, and sharp enough to rend flesh and bone. The gammenore uses this smaller claw to tear its victims into pieces small enough to eat, and to perform any manipulations too delicate for the large claw. Its eyes are located on short stalks that rise from the front of its carapace, allowing it to see even when encased in its shell of ice. A gammenore is approximately 8 feet wide, and weighs between 2,000 and 3,000 pounds.",
			"",
			"Despite their resemblance to mundane crabs, gammenores are primarily terrestrial creatures, living in water only as larvae and while mating. They can be found anywhere ice and snow exists on Triaxus, from the high mountains to the low snowy plains, or even atop the ice-covered seas. The gammenore is an ambush predator, preferring to conceal itself in snow banks or among ice formations and wait for prey to approach. Once a victim is within reach, the gammenore erupts from hiding and attempts to grab or cripple the target with its large claw. Failing that, it may chase down its prey on foot, especially if the victim seems injured or the terrain favors climbing over sprinting. When times are lean, a gammenore may resort to scavenging or even to stealing food from larger predators, trusting its shell to protect it from enemies' reprisals.",
			"",
			"When threatened, a gammenore forces freezing water through pores in its shell to form a barrier of spikes across its carapace. These spikes break and fuse together over time to form a thick sheet of jagged ice over much of the gammenore's body, granting it a second layer of defense against attacks. A gammenore is able to excrete more water this way than it should theoretically be able to carry within its body, leading many scholars to conclude that much of the ice is magically produced or conjured. Despite this, gammenores seem to possess an unquenchable thirst, spending much of their time eating snow and ice. The creatures also prefer to eat their food frozen, letting victims' torn bodies freeze before crunching away at their meals.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"During Triaxus's harsh winters, gammenores rarely spend much time in each other's company, as they are extremely competitive and fight each other for food or territory. Their behavior changes drastically as the season begins to turn-they become much more companionable as winter's grip on the land weakens. As spring nears, gammenores from across Triaxus instinctively begin to migrate to the nearest body of water to mate and lay their eggs. These eggs then go dormant during the planet's long summer, hatching as the water temperature begins to drop once again. After laying their eggs, gammenores migrate to the coldest, most remote parts of the world. This is a time of danger for the civilized races of Triaxus, for gammenore migration routes are hardly regular each season and often cross through populated areas. In the northern stretches of the Allied Territories, inhabitants tell tales of armies of gammenores, over a hundred strong, marching through cities and leaving naught but rubble and ruin. These stories are most likely exaggerations, as gammenores rarely travel in groups larger than nine, but such packs of migrating gammenores can still wreak havoc on a community.",
			"",
			"At the end of the gammenores' journey, they gather by the hundreds atop the tallest mountains and in the deepest caverns of the world to flee the coming heat. Near the planet's north pole these colonies can grow into the thousands, covering swaths of land in a living blanket of gammenores. Piled atop each other, the gammenores extend their ice shells to cover their entire bodies, encasing themselves in ice and slowing their metabolisms in an attempt to preserve themselves. Precipitation during the tail end of winter combines with the gammenore's own supernatural cold to further cement the creatures together, forming miniature glaciers and mountain icecaps to protect the colony from the heat of the planet's long summer.",
			"",
			"This defense is far from perfect and few gammenores survive to the next winter. During particularly hot summers, gammenores on the periphery of the colony thaw prematurely. These gammenores either die quickly from the heat, or stumble into glacial runoff and are washed downstream, becoming short-lived menaces to riverside communities. Summertime gammenores react to heat dangers as though they were one category more severe-normal temperatures count as hot conditions, hot conditions count as severe heat, etc. The high temperatures of summer also disorient the gammenores, giving them the confused condition. Gammenores in the heat lose their shell of ice ability entirely, and produce sprays of cold water from their bodies in place of ice spikes, allowing them to attempt a single combat maneuver check to bull rush all adjacent creatures once every 1d4 rounds. Reduce the CR of a gammenore encountered in the summertime by 2.",
			"",
			"Gammenore eggs hatch in late fall, releasing swarms of larvae into the waters in which they were deposited. These larvae feed upon each other, and on anything the current washes them across, until they mature into adult gammenores at the start of winter. Meanwhile, the adults that survived the summer chip themselves free from their communal glaciers to seek new hunting grounds away from their competitive kin, so that they can feed and restore their strength."

Typically, a ganzi's oddity is chosen from the most common manifestations of entropy listed below, but other, more unique oddities can certainly exist. The numbers listed for each option can be used to randomly determine what form of ganzi oddity a particular Ganzi might have, at the GM's option, but the quibble ability is the most common.",
			"",
			"- 1-2: Chaos Champion (Su) Ganzis with a lineage linked to the einherji often become crusaders for the forces of entropy and excel in combat against lawful beings. The ganzi can smite law once per day as a swift action, targeting a lawful foe. She adds her Charisma modifier as a bonus on attack rolls and gains a bonus on damage rolls equal to her Hit Dice. Once activated, smite law persists until the target is dead or the ganzi rests, whichever comes first.",
			"- 3-4: Entropic Flesh (Ex) Ganzis with lineages that link strongly to chaos beasts retain some of their ancestors' immunity to transformation. In addition to gaining a +2 bonus on Escape Artist checks and to CMD against grapple combat maneuvers, when such ganzis are affected by a hostile transmutation effect (such as polymorphing or petrification), they can attempt a new saving throw at the start of their next turn to end the effect. They gain a +4 bonus on this second saving throw, but if they fail, the transmutation effect persists as long as it normally would.",
			"- 5-6: Prehensile Tail (Ex) Ganzis with lineages that are particularly influenced by the presence of proteans often have colorful feathers, scales, or skin, and a long serpentine tail. This tail can be used to carry items. While ganzis with this oddity cannot wield weapons with their tails, they can use their tails to retrieve small, stowed objects carried on their persons as a swift action.",
			"- 7-14: Quibble (Su) For most ganzis, the influence of chaos is relatively subtle and manifests as an ability to infect others with entropy and unexpected luck (be it good luck or bad). Once per day as an immediate action, a ganzi can twist probability and alter the luck of a single creature within 20 feet, forcing it to reroll a single d20 roll it has just made. The target must take the second result, even if it is worse. A ganzi can use this ability after the target has rolled but must use it before the GM declares whether the roll was a success or failure. Unwilling creatures can resist a ganzi's quibble with a successful Will save (DC = 10 + half the ganzi's level + the ganzi's Charisma modifier). This is a curse effect.",
			"- 15-18: Spell-Like Ability (Sp) Ganzis whose chaotic influences rise from regions other than the Maelstrom or its inhabitants often manifest an oddity that duplicates the effects of a specific spell. Such ganzis gain one of the following spell-like abilities, usable once per day at a caster level equal to the ganzi's HD: alter self, blur, detect thoughts, hideous laughter, minor image, shatter, or spider climb.",
			"- 19-20: Weaponplay (Ex) Ganzis with lineages that link to the valkyries manifest their heritage in their skill in combat. Such ganzis are always proficient with all simple and martial weapons, and they can qualify for feats normally available only to fighters (such as [Weapon Specialization](feat/weapon_specialization)) even if they don't have any fighter class levels.",
			"",
			"#### Description",
			"",
			"Ganzis are the end result of planar chaos touching living creatures. Where the planes brush against the Material Plane or where chaotic inhabitants (be they chaos beasts, proteans, valkyries, or others) affect or influence mortal life, ganzis are born in their wake like ripples in a pond.",
			"",
			"While ganzis are superficially human in appearance, they often have features that set them apart from the rest of humanity. These features can vary widely; one ganzi might have a discolored hand that flickers with entropic (but harmless) energy, while another might have brightly colored scales covering her shoulders and back, and yet another might have horns and glowing green eyes. Likewise, ganzi height and weight can vary dramatically, even by human standards, but the average ganzi stands between 5 and 6 feet tall and weighs anywhere from 100 to 300 pounds.",
			"",
			"Many ganzis are mistaken for aasimars or tieflings at birth, but in truth ganzi births very rarely result from mortals mingling with outsiders. The vast majority are born after one or both parents were exposed to a force of chaotic or entropic energy. As such, the circumstances of a ganzi's childhood can vary dramatically and depend on the parents' tolerance for the unexpected. A ganzi's tendency towards chaos exacerbates this, with many ganzis developing gregarious, iconoclastic, or thrill-seeking reputations among their peers. A sizable minority of ganzis appear completely human early in life, their anarchic heritage manifesting shortly after puberty in a chaotic-and traumatic-spasm of rapid evolution. While ganzis are most commonly of human stock, it is not unknown for ganzis to be born among other races. These ganzis bear superficial signs of their non-human heritage, but their statistics and abilities are identical to those born to humans.",
			"",
			"Like other native outsiders of humanoid heritage, ganzis are found most often scattered amidst the societies of their parent races. The rare ganzis who choose not to wander may live their entire lives without meeting another of their kind. Due to their scattered pattern of birth and their tendency towards wandering lifestyles, ganzis rarely congregate in significant numbers and almost never form cultures of their own. On occasion, a Material Plane society in a region with links to other planes will produce enough ganzis over time for them to form their own subculture, but such societies are rare indeed.",
			"",
			"Given their relationship to the Cerulean Void and its natives, it is not uncommon for ganzis with awareness of their heritage and the resources for planar travel to journey to the Maelstrom. Some ganzis make this pilgrimage to seek out proteans, valkyries, or other natives of the Maelstrom in hopes of understanding their own place in the cosmos, while others are drawn to the idea of communing with the vast and potent force of primordial chaos itself.",
			"",
			"As befits their chaotic origin, the personality and outlook of individual ganzis can vary significantly. Often chaotic-aligned, with no particular tendency towards good or evil, many find themselves drawn to the life of the wandering adventurer. Ganzis are commonly possessed of deep curiosity and powerful creative talent, leading many to become artists or bards, while others enjoy the alchemist's dichotomous mastery of creation and destruction. Sorcerous talents and oracular mysteries of all varieties are unsurprisingly common among ganzis."

			"A garden ooze is an animate, acidic mass of protoplasmic goo that dwells among foliage and scavenges proteins in the form of carrion or small animals that blunder into its vicinity. Although garden oozes are occasionally found in underground regions near the surface-such as sewers, sinkholes, and shallow caves-these oozes prefer the outdoors. One reason for this is that garden oozes are attracted to large collections of organic material where other tiny creatures might come to scavenge.",
			"",
			"Quick and cunning hunters when compared to most oozes, garden oozes are particularly dangerous because they readily attack creatures that wander nearby regardless of the creatures' size. Oozes that sense prey moving closer are likely to wait to attack until the potential meal is within reach. The oozes also give chase when prey flees. Garden oozes innately change hue to match the ground underneath them, so they can be hard to spot.",
			"",
			"When a garden ooze attacks, it lashes out with a whiplike appendage coated with a potent flesh-eating acid. If injured, the ooze releases a disgusting stench that makes it harder to fight off. Further, when one garden ooze attacks, any other garden oozes nearby join in, piling on and making escape all but impossible.",
			"",
			"Fortunately for larger potential prey, most garden oozes are quite small, the largest among them reaching 3 feet in diameter before they split into smaller oozes. These oozes are also known as rat-catcher oozes or compost oozes, and some brave gardeners actually encourage the growth of such oozes in their gardens as a way to combat pests. Once the pests are under control, however, the oozes themselves must be hunted and slain before the garden is safe to tend."

			"#### Description",
			"",
			"Crueler and more volatile than their sea-serpent cousins, gargiyas gravitate toward and sustain themselves on seismic hotspots. Far from being a danger to the beasts, these bubbling crevices spew a form of magma that imbues gargiyas with incredible abilities. From birth, gargiyas ingest magma bubbling up from the ocean floor. By the time they've reached maturity, the monsters develop a molten core in their gullets that allows them to call forth scalding heat at will. Gargiyas' aggressive tendencies toward seafarers have garnered them a well-earned nickname: \"boiler beasts.\"",
			"",
			"Gargiyas' affinity for all things volcanic has left a pattern of stippled crimson on their massive, snake-like bodies. The spiny frills jutting from their heads and necks resemble enormous, iron-forged blades, and hundreds of stubby appendages line the sides of their underbellies, wriggling ominously when the beasts rear from the sea. Of all the gargiyas' features, though, perhaps the most intimidating are their eyes and maws, which seethe with the light and heat of burning coals-particularly when the beasts are aggravated. Capable of slithering through water like an enormous python, a gargiya stretches 30 feet in length and weighs up to 5 tons.",
			"",
			"Legends of the seas say that early in gargiyas' existence, as the ocean floor around them shuddered and stretched, the warmth of the seas' burgeoning volcanoes fascinated the beasts. To the gargiyas, these seismic regions offered a siren call of safety, isolation and-unbeknownst to the animalistic creatures-power. While it's unclear just how it lends gargiyas such power, scholars agree that this magma serves as gargiyas' primary sustenance and as the source of their hyperthermal abilities.",
			"",
			"Scholars believe that as gargiyas became more adept at manipulating heat, they became more protective of the magma vents they call home. Whereas early legends speak of gargiyas that rarely surfaced, preferring to stay close to their volcanic lairs, modern stories tell of gargiyas that see any sentient creatures-even if they're sailing a mile away-as threats to be met head-on. The few sailors who have survived these encounters warn of gargiyas that actively patrol the waters surrounding their magma vents, surfacing at even the slightest sign of unlucky passersby. Apparently, to the gargiyas, any who venture near their precious lairs must covet them.",
			"",
			"Because of gargiyas' aggressiveness, a small subset of oceanic cartographers has devoted itself to recording the locations of their known lairs. These maps, available in many southern ports' markets, are popular among traders and pirates who wish to skirt fiery confrontation. However, in testament to the cutthroat competition between many port merchants, it's not unheard of for these maps to contain \"mistakes\"-oversights built into the guides by their previous owners, hoping to lure rivals to horrific doom, or protect favored shipping lanes.",
			"",
			"Despite gargiyas' destructive reputations, some Golarion cultures revere their molten cores as a symbol of status and wealth. Taldans, in particular, are drawn to the cores' seductively mysterious glow. The richest Taldan patriarchs often believe owning such a rare treasure-and showing it off, of course-is a worthy life goal. Careless of the risks gargiya hunts entail, these patriarchs sometimes sponsor teams of adventurers to quest for these cores. Most of these expeditions end in bloody and burning tragedy, but to some hardy sea-goers, the potential rewards of glory and riches are too alluring to resist.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"Gargiyas mostly live alone near major archipelagos with abundant volcanic activity. They are most numerous in the isolated waters surrounding the Shackles, though scattered sightings have been reported throughout Golarion's warmer seas. There is a significant concentration of gargiyas near the Smoker where magma seeps up from the sea floor, and also talk of a stretch north of Shark Island where gargiya lairs speckle the ocean floor by the dozens. No one knows, however, whether this latter story is true or rather was concocted to deter authorities from the hideouts of buccaneers who roamed the islands before the sahuagin staked their claim there.",
			"",
			"Gargiyas do not typically share their homes with others of their kind. However, sailors have told stories of defeating a gargiya after a long and brutal struggle only to come face to face with another one-ostensibly coming to its kin's aid. The question of whether these tales are simple exaggerations or evidence of gargiya collaboration has prompted many a fistfight in portside taverns. How well these braggarts fare in such brawls often indicates whether they're capable of the outlandish adventures they so boldly claim.",
			"",
			"Although tales of collaborating gargiyas are unsettling enough, even more sinister rumors have surfaced from seafarers who dare to brave the Eye of Abendego. There, the tales say, the turbulent seas beneath Golarion's permanent hurricane hide groups of gargiyas whipped into a frenzy by the tempest that followed Aroden's death a century ago. According to legend, these gargiyas roam the entire area of the Eye as predators, ambushing ships and boiling their crews in the ocean's salty waters. It is said that they decorate their volcanic lairs with their victims' bones, hinting that gargiyas possess an intelligence beyond that of mere animals.",
			"",
			"Unlike many reptilian creatures, gargiyas birth their young live. Scholars agree that, typically, male and female gargiyas come together to breed every decade or so. Afterward, the beasts abandon each other. When the female returns to her lair, she is thought to consume large amounts of magma while her single snakeling gestates, usually for a period of about 10 years. When giving birth, the gargiya expels her offspring into a magmaspewing fissure, where it grows and gathers strength until it leaves to find its own home. Although there is some debate about gargiyas' longevity, scholars believe they typically live around 300 years. Rumors, however, speak of gargiyas that have lived much longer-perhaps even predating modern civilization-but if any have encountered such an ancient terror and survived, they have never surfaced to tell the tale."

			"Gargoyles often appear to be winged stone statues, for they can perch indefinitely without moving, allowing them to surprise their foes. Gargoyles tend toward obsessive-compulsive behaviors that are as varied as their kind is plentiful. Books, stolen trinkets, weapons, and grisly trophies harvested from fallen foes are just a few examples of the types of things a gargoyle might collect to decorate its lair and territory. Gargoyles tend toward a solitary lifestyle, though they sometimes form fearsome groups called \"wings\" for protection and sport. In certain conditions, a tribe of gargoyles might even ally with other creatures, but even the most stable alliances with a gargoyle tribe can collapse for the smallest of reasons-gargoyles are nothing if not treacherous, petty, and vindictive. Gargoyles have been known to dwell in the heart of the largest of cities, crouching amid the decorations of stone cathedrals and buildings where they hide in plain sight by day and swoop down to feed on vagabonds, beggars, and other unfortunates at night.",
			"",
			"The longer a tribe of gargoyles abides in a region of ruins or buildings, the more its members come to resemble that region's architectural styles. The changes a gargoyle's appearance undergoes are slow and subtle, but over the course of years, it can shift radically.",
			"",
			"One unusual variant of gargoyle dwells not amid buildings and ruins but under the waves of the sea. These creatures are known as kapoacinths-they have the same basic statistics as normal gargoyles, save that they have the aquatic subtype and their wings grant them a swim speed of 60 feet (but are useless for actual flight). Kapoacinths dwell in shallow, coastal regions where they can shamble up from the surf to prey on those that reside there. They are more likely to form wings, as kapoacinths prefer group living to a solitary lifestyle.",

			"One of the dungeon's most unusual and specialized predators, gelatinous cubes spend their existence mindlessly roaming dungeon halls and dark caverns, swallowing up organic material such as plants, refuse, carrion, and even living creatures. Materials the cube cannot digest, such as metal and stone, can eventually fill up the creature's mass with such detritus, and at times the creature may excrete some of this material out of its body. Often the treasure and possessions of past victims remain inside the gelatinous cube, leaving a ghostly impression of their material remains.",
			"",
			"Sages believe these creatures evolved as a specialized advancement of gray oozes. Some beings use gelatinous cubes as protectors of dungeons and underground fortifications, trapping the immense creatures in massive metal crates and transporting them through either slave power or magic to their final guard posts. They make particularly efficient waste disposal mechanisims as well-a tribe that can trap a gelatinous cube in a pit or other area that it cannot climb out of can use it as a midden or even a deadly trap, depending only on the ingenuity of the creatures who caught it.",
			"",
			"Gelatinous cubes are generally 10 feet to a side and weigh upward of 15,000 pounds, though subterranean explorers report larger specimens trawling the deepest caves and corridors. In locations with plentiful sources of food, gelatinous cubes can exist for hundreds of years, if not thousands. However, if denied organic material for more than 6 months, a gelatinous cube begins shrinking. Eventually this stresses its walls and the creature leaks rapidly evaporating slimy liquid until its body collapses and disappears completely."

Additionally, once per round as a free action, it can also use one of its tentacles to target a creature with one of two sounds, imposing either the frightened or stunned condition for 1d6 rounds unless the target succeeds at a DC 20 Will save. A creature that successfully saves cannot be affected by the same genghryl's disturbing vocalizations for 24 hours. This is a sonic mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.",
			"",
			"**Lure Tentacles (Ex)** A genghryl has a number of specialized tentacles equal to half its Hit Dice. It uses these tentacles to animate and manipulate the corpses of Small or smaller creatures and to emit its disturbing vocalizations. A genghryl typically uses these tentacles to maintain the illusion that a colony of burrowing animals is alive and well, drawing in larger, predatory animals. When it uses animals' corpses in this way, it gains a +8 bonus on Disguise checks (in addition to its normal racial bonus). Although the genghryl can animate Small humanoids in this manner, it does not gain the additional bonus on Disguise checks when doing so. Severing a lure tentacle requires a sunder attempt with a slashing weapon targeting the tentacle. A lure tentacle is considered a separate weapon with hardness 0 and hit points equal to the genghryl's Hit Dice (typically 16 hp). To sever a tentacle, an opponent must deal enough damage to reduce the tentacle's hit points to 0 or fewer. Severing a tentacle deals an amount of damage to the genghryl's body equal to its Hit Dice. A genghryl with no remaining lure tentacles can't use its disturbing vocalizations.",
			"",
			"**Sinkhole (Ex)** A genghryl can cause an adjacent area of the ground above it (up to a 10-foot-by-10-foot square) to collapse, dropping any creatures in the affected squares into a 10-foot-deep hole unless they succeed at a DC 23 Reflex save, as though they had been subjected to the effects of a pit trap. The genghryl waits adjacent to the bottom of the pit and can immediately make a single melee attack against the flat-footed AC of one creature that fell in. A creature that fails the Reflex save by 5 or more also falls prone. The save DC is Strength-based.",
			"",
			"#### Description",
			"",
			"Genghryls are subterranean, wormlike creatures that use specialized tentacles to lure and weaken their prey. Genghryls are to verdant lands what seaweed sirens are to shipping lanes or wolves-in-sheep's-clothing are to plentiful woodlands-a menace.",
			"",
			"A genghryl's mottled, pinkish-brown body is about 3 feet wide at the front and tapers down to its tail, resembling a hideous segmented worm. Its head consists of a tooth-lined opening behind a sharp beak, which is surrounded by four powerful tentacles and three black eyes spaced evenly around it. A number of longer, thinner tentacles sprout from the segment just behind the genghryl's head. The older and larger the genghryl, the more tentacles it has.",
			"",
			"An adult genghryl weighs approximately 300 pounds.",
			"",
			"Genghryls live below ground and, although they prefer temperate or warm climates, can survive nearly anywhere that isn't flooded, frozen, or scalding. Their adaptations make them suited to regions where they can take over colonies of small, burrowing mammals like groundhogs, meerkats, prairie dogs, and similar prey animals.",
			"",
			"When a genghryl moves into an area, it uses its tentacles to subdue and then strangle a colony of mammals. Instead of eating these creatures, the genghryl inserts each of its lure tentacles into one of the corpses and animates it. The genghryl manipulates these corpses so it appears the mound is inhabited by active but careless creatures. It then hollows out the ground beneath the burrow, weakening key points, and waits for a predatory animal-like a badger, fox, or something larger-to notice the potential prey.",
			"",
			"When its prey gets close enough to the burrow, either to capture an easy meal or to investigate the animals' strange behavior, the genghryl collapses the ground beneath its victim. The victim falls into the pit, where the genghryl waits to grab it. If an approaching creature is too strong or dangerous, the genghryl can emit shrieking noises from its lure tentacles to either weaken or frighten away the threat.",
			"",
			"A genghryl's lure tentacles don't keep the dead animals from decaying, so it must eventually abandon a depleted den and seek out fresh lures. The number of animals a genghryl can manipulate is limited to the number of lure tentacles it has. Although genghryls typically use Tiny animals, they can manipulate creatures as large as humanoids. The genghryl's primitive intelligence might even allow it to approximate some basic humanoid behaviors. A massive genghryl living beneath a lonely village could pose a horrifying threat to weary travelers.",
			"",
			"Genghryls require large hunting areas and are fiercely territorial. They are hermaphroditic, like earthworms, and mating is the only reason two genghryls will tolerate one other's presence. After mating, each genghryl lays a clutch of slime-covered eggs beneath a small, active burrow on the edge of its territory. The first genghryl to hatch eats the other eggs, feeding on its siblings to gain strength, then attacks the nearby burrow and begins its own predation.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"The earliest records of creatures like genghryls come from stories of the Warabutu tribe of Rechiend's Plains, between the Mwangi Jungle and the Kaava Lands. The tales speak of a \"tunneling horror\" that snatches hunting dogs, cattle, and even people. The Warabutu claim that the colonies of giant ants found on the plains feed on the tunneling horrors, keeping their numbers in check.",
			"",
			"Within the past several years, genghryls have begun appearing in the Plains of Molthune. The name genghryl is a composite word that borrows from Hallit and refers loosely to a tunneling horror. The creatures have multiplied at an alarming rate, and the locals' lack of experience with them puts people at great risk. This danger only compounds the problems posed by the labor shortage in Molthune's breadbasket.",
			"",
			"The local lords believe that someone-probably one among them-accidentally brought genghryl eggs from the Mwangi Expanse, perhaps mixed in with seeds or some other product intended to boost production on their lands. Without any giant ants to serve as natural predators, the creatures hatched and began preying on the prairie dogs and other regional creatures, including people. Word of this threat has reached the imperial governor in Canorate, who is offering a substantial reward to anyone who can exterminate the genghryls without introducing aggressive giant ants to Molthune. The imperial governor is also offering a slightly smaller reward to whoever identifies the fool who brought the genghryls to Molthune in the first place."

			"Birthed from the unfathomable terrors of the cavernous deep, geomaws roam the Darklands, finding easy prey among the covetous races of Nar-Voth and Golarion's surface. Their hulking bodies can extend up to 15 feet long and weigh between 2,000 and 4,000 pounds. Despite their great size, geomaws require little sustenance, and can go weeks or even months between meals. They pause for days or weeks on end, remaining perfectly motionless as they wait for prey. This creature's open maw resembles a cache of valuable crystals, ripe for the plucking. Curious beasts and greedy prospectors alike flock to these shining gemstones-attracted by the subtle shimmering light they radiate and the faint, sweet scent the geomaw exudes-only to be quickly gobbled up.",
			"",
			"These strange aberrations reproduce rarely, gathering in great numbers in the wet, hot underground chambers that surround volcanoes. Geomaws lay caches of eggs that take three years to hatch. The mineral-laden waters of these caverns are vital to the formation of a young geomaw's stony hide and gemlike teeth.",
			"",
			"Geomaws have little society of their own and seem content to traverse the outskirts of wilder civilizations, feeding on the blood and flesh of unwary creatures that seek shelter or riches in the caves near the surface. On the rare occasion one cares to communicate, it does so through a series of tail thumps and clinks produced by tapping its crystalline teeth together. Mating groups of geomaws sometimes produce hauntingly beautiful sounds in such a manner."

In such situations, the best answer is usually to humor the gerbie until it falls asleep or gets distracted, then slip out of its friendship aura and flee quickly. While gerbie settlements tend to be idyllic places, full of laughter and huts built from hollowed-out mushrooms, many gerbies feel called to wander the world teaching other creatures the value of friendship.

			"**Carapace (Ex)** A ghelarn typically shelters within a hardened, rocklike shell that houses all of its vital organs. By withdrawing its tentacles and sensory stalks into its shell, the ghelarn gains total cover until the beginning of its next turn. The shell doesn't provide cover against targeted spells, and the ghelarn's movement is limited to downward burrowing during this time. The benefits of the shell can be lost if sundered (hardness 5, 8 hit points, regenerates in 2d6 days), and a ghelarn caught without its carapace loses its natural armor bonus.",
			"",
			"**Entrap (Ex)** A ghelarn secretes a quagmire of sticky fluid a few feet below the sand where it lives. This fluid extends in a 10-foot radius around the creature and acts to trap victims, making it easier for the ghelarn to attack prey with its tentacles or feed upon it with its leeching tendrils. This otherwise acts as the [entrap](umr/entrap) universal monster rule.",
			"",
			"**Hibernate (Ex)** When food is scarce, a ghelarn can enter a state of hibernation for an indefinite period of time. When it enters hibernation, the ghelarn nestles itself in the sand and fills in its porous carapace with sticky excretions that quickly harden to seal the creature from the elements. When hibernating, the ghelarn doesn't have to eat or drink. A ghelarn remains in a state of hibernation until it senses another living creature within 10 feet, at which point it dissolves the seals on its carapace over the course of 1d4 minutes.",
			"",
			"**Leeching Tendrils (Ex)** A living creature that spends more than a single round ensnared within a ghelarn's entrapping fluid becomes targeted by invasive tendrils from the ghelarn's lower body. These feeding stalks deal 1 point of bleed damage each round, and continue to do so for as long as a victim remains within the area of the ghelarn's entrapping fluid.",
			"",
			"#### Description",
			"",
			"Born on the desert plain of an alien world, the softbodied ghelarn is a non-aquatic arthropod living within a shell-like exoskeleton manufactured from its own hardened secretions. This outer carapace contains many perforations, similar to dry coral or air-blasted stone, providing ample room from which the ghelarn can extend its outer extremities and explore the world. Chief among these appendages are two main tentacles that it uses to pull itself through the upper layers of sand within its native home, burrowing just below the surface while its hardened carapace remains above ground. As a result, ghelarns give the impression of ambulatory stone formations when traveling, but they can also abandon their shells entirely and delve deeper into the sand to avoid predators.",
			"",
			"Patient, quiet creatures, ghelarns prefer to ambush prey, waiting until suitable meals wander within reach of their tentacles or into the sticky quagmires they create just below the surface around their nesting grounds. Helpless victims soon find themselves pulled into the sand as the ghelarn extends invasive tendrils from its lower body. These lesser tentacles slowly bleed away moisture from anyone trapped in the ooze, leaving behind little more than dried husks and bones for scavengers to find, along with whatever equipment such victims may have carried.",
			"",
			"During the creatures' spawning season, an entire clutch of ghelarns produces a variant musk in their secretions to attract one another. Some travel for miles in search of this scent, and the resulting orgy once a group gathers allows for a communal intermingling of reproductive oils. This impregnates multiple ghelarn at the same time, enabling them to spawn new offspring as they separate again. A typical ghelarn can create 1d3 young, which gestate for consecutive 3-month periods rather than being born all at once. Pregnant ghelarns abandon these young to fend for themselves almost as soon as they're born, moving to another region to birth more offspring rather than leaving them within the same area to compete for resources.",
			"",
			"It takes a newborn ghelarn about 2 weeks before it can muster enough secretions to form a hardened shell of its own. During this time, it stays deep below the earth, seeking nourishment and moisture trapped in the desert soil rather than risking its vulnerable body to predators above ground. Once fully matured, it pushes upward, its shell rising from the sand to mark its domain. Sentient creatures wisely avoid these areas, though it's often hard to tell empty shells from a living ghelarn's hunting grounds. Many societies find the abandoned and cast-off shells useful for making tools and crafting weapons and armor. As a result, ghelarn habitats frequently draw those seeking to harvest them as a resource. Unfortunately for the scavengers, these shells also attract young ghelarns who haven't yet formed their own and seek to use the abandoned ones as temporary homes.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"Ghelarns typically live solitary lives. The extreme nature of their native habitat causes them to separate and spread out to avoid overhunting an area. They sometimes cooperate in pairs or packs known as clutches to defend themselves, but more frequently do so in preparation for mating season, so they can drag down large prey that they leave behind for their new offspring to feed upon. Sometimes a clutch will gather in geologically unstable regions, where quakes and tremors draw their interest. Mostly, they migrate in seemingly aimless patterns, driven away from the harsh sounds of overhead thunderstorms, as the noise causes them acute pain.",
			"",
			"The rudimentary sentience of ghelarns places them just above animal-level intelligence. Though they have no real language of their own, they communicate warnings or call for help by turning their porous shells into the wind and adjusting the flow with their tentacles, allowing air to pass through the openings, and creating a musical \"voice\" similar to wind instruments. Each ghelarn's voice is distinctly different from any other ghelarn. Some societies have also learned to domesticate young ghelarns-these cultures train them to understand simple commands and use them as guard animals.",
			"",
			"### Noble Ghelarns",
			"",
			"Occasionally, evolution gives rise to a more advanced breed of ghelarn. These specimens have both the advanced and giant simple templates, and prove more intelligent than their lesser kin. The shell of a noble ghelarn encompasses a much greater area, appearing more like an outcropping of rock or a small hillside. This grants them the freeze special quality to appear as such, allowing them to take 20 on their Stealth checks to hide in plain sight. Noble ghelarns sometimes remain hidden within these massive shells and purposefully suppress their entrapping ooze in order to dupe other creatures into seeking shelter next to them. While the tall shell certainly provides shade from the sun and a windbreak against desert storms, those camping near a noble ghelarn inevitably find themselves assaulted during the night by the creature's invasive tendrils. These appendages are more leechlike than the painful barbs of lesser ghelarns and require a DC 20 Perception check for sleeping creatures to notice."

			"Ghorans arose from plant life created by advanced druidic magic to be an especially hardy and adaptive food source for humans. Over the centuries, the plants evolved sentience and ambulatory bodies that mimicked the appearance of humanoids as a method to discourage their enemies from hunting them and improve their chances of survival. Their creators did not imbue them with the ability to create more of the ghorus seeds that give them life, so ghorans are fanatically protective of these seeds and consider destroying them the worst of crimes."

While a ghorazagh can spray this fluid as an attack to impede prey, the primary use of the foul substance is as a building material. Ghorazagh hives are constructed entirely of this material, which when it dries has the strength of metal while retaining a dark red resinlike appearance. A ghorazagh hive is a nightmare place as a result-twisting tunnels with an eerily organic appearance that can wind for miles on end."

			"The ghouls of the nightmare dimension of Leng are far more powerful and more intelligent than their lesser kin that haunt and caper in the lonely graveyards of the Material Plane, yet they are also more prone to discussion and debate with intruders. Ghoul warrens that burrow deep enough can inexplicably cross over from this world to Leng, allowing the ghouls of that realm access to this world. Leng ghouls delight in feasting on dead flesh and consider themselves gourmets of rot and decay, treating a full coffin as a sumptuous banquet table.",
			"",
			"Leng ghouls maintain complex societies and extensive warrens when they colonize reaches of the Material Planes, digging deep below the surface graveyards they choose to haunt. These creatures are not only driven to gather victims to slaughter and bodies to ripen-they also seek out forbidden texts and magical scrolls to augment their ever-increasing stores of knowledge, which often rival the greatest of wizardly libraries in size, although their subject matter tends to be limited to necromancy and the study of forbidden rites. A Leng ghoul can sometimes be convinced to let a particularly delicious-looking intruder go (relatively) unharmed in exchange for new lore.",
			"",
			"Although most Leng ghouls venerate the Great Old Ones or Outer Gods (they have a particular affinity for Nyarlathotep), a rare few of these creatures retain more of their humanity than merely their living intellect. These unique few drift away from evil in their pursuit of magical lore-while they still hunger for dead flesh, many try their best to feed only on those who died naturally or willingly offer themselves up to the carrion feast in return for favors. While many eventually succumb to the temptation to feed on fresh kills in time, a rare few manage to maintain nonevil alignments. Such rare ghouls also retain some or all of the class levels they had in life, transferring those levels onto their new undead forms. The bulk of these Leng ghouls have levels as arcane spellcasters or rogues, since those who were once divine spellcasters, or otherwise religious in life, tend to be wholly devoted to gods of evil and decay."

Sometimes a ghul follows a funeral procession in hyena form, keeping a safe distance until the ceremony, whereupon it changes into its true form to attack and feast. Sorrow and despair taste as delicious as innocence to a ghul.",

A well-sated ghul organizes with others of its kind and lesser undead, tormenting nearby towns and settlements. A ghul involved with this level of organization often has a scattered set of lairs throughout the desert. These allow the ghul to strike far from its home lair and hide again without having to travel during the blistering daylight sun. When a ghul goes for too long without feeding, it becomes increasingly feral and violent-its statistics don't change, but it grows less concerned with fleeing combat, even when it is obviously outmatched.",

Great ghuls like to follow passers-by invisibly before revealing themselves in suitably isolated locales. If they find potential victims particularly interesting, they may engage them in a battle of wits or some challenge in order for them to spare their lives. A common challenge is to provide the ghul with a certain number of fresh corpses within a certain number of nights.

A great ghul's red-hot body deals 1d6 points of extra fire damage whenever it hits in melee, or in each round it maintains a hold when grappling. Only a great ghul that was once an efreeti can have this ability.",
			"",
			"Metalmorph (Su) As a standard action, a great ghul may warp and deform any one metal object within 20 feet. This functions like warp wood, but affects only metal objects that fail a DC 18 Fortitude save (attended objects use their wielder's saves). Armor or shields lose half their bonus to AC (enhancement bonuses are unaffected), and weapons are rendered useless except as improvised clubs. The transformation lasts 1 minute, after which the affected metal reverts to its normal state. The save DC is Charisma-based. Only a great ghul that was once a shaitain can have this ability.",

			"Water's Fury (Su) As a standard action, a great ghul may fire a jet of water in a 60-foot line. The water deals 1d6 hit points of damage and blinds anyone it hits for 1d6 rounds. A successful Reflex save (DC 18) means a creature takes half damage and is not blinded. The save DC is Charisma-based. Only a great ghul that was once a marid can have this ability.",
			"",
			"Whirlwind (Su) As a standard action a great ghul can transform itself into a whirlwind of air, bone shards, and pieces of gristle, with its head floating about. A great ghul's movement while in whirlwind form does not provoke attacks of opportunity, even if the great ghul enters the space another creature occupies. Any creature sharing a space with the whirlwind or attacking it with natural weapons takes 1d6 hit points of damage. Any living creature that begins its turn in the whirlwind's space must succeed on a DC 18 Fortitude save or be nauseated for 1 round. The save DC is Charisma-based. Returning to its normal form is a standard action. Only a great ghul that was once a djinni can have this ability."

			"A frost giant's hair can be light blue or dirty yellow, and its eyes usually match its hair color. Frost giants dress in skins and pelts, along with any jewelry they own. Frost giant warriors also don chain shirts and metal helmets decorated with horns or feathers. An adult male stands about 15 feet tall and weighs approximately 2,800 pounds. Females are slightly shorter and lighter, but otherwise identical to males. Frost giants can live to be 250 years old.",

			"Frost giants are among the most feared giants, as their wanton destruction, battle lust, and fearless demeanor push them to ever-increasing displays of brutality. Frost giants usually start combat at a distance, throwing rocks until they run out of ammunition or the opponent closes, then wading in with their enormous greataxes. A favorite tactic is to lay an ambush by hiding buried in the snow at the top of an icy or snowy slope, where opponents will have difficulty reaching them, and then starting an avalanche before leaping into battle. Frost giants can hide well in snowy environments and are masters of stealth in their domain.",
			"",
			"Frost giants survive on hunting and raiding alone, as they live in desolate, frigid environments. Frost giant groups are split almost evenly between those that live in makeshift settlements or abandoned castles and those that roam the frozen north as nomads in search of spoils and provisions. Frost giant leaders call themselves jarls and demand absolute obedience from their followers. At any time a jarl may be challenged by combat for leadership of the tribe. These challenges typically result in the death of one of the combatants. A single jarl can often count a dozen or more smaller frost giant tribes as part of his extended tribe. In such a situation, the leaders of the lesser tribes are known simply as chieftains or warlords.",
			"",
			"Frost giants love to take captives, and use them for food as well as slaves and commodities. Every group of frost giants typically has 1-2 humanoid slaves shackled to a slave handler-usually the meanest and cruelest non-jarl in the group. They are also quite fond of monstrous pets-white dragons and winter wolves are popular choices, but remorhazes, yetis, and even linnorms can be found dwelling in a frost giant lair."

On raids, they exult in the fear that their mighty appearance causes, often breaking enemy lines with the sheer sight of their howling charge. Unlike frost giant rangers, frost giant raiders are less concerned with stealth or tactics than with impressing each other via dramatic feats, and wiser jarls know when to rein in their troops lest frost giant bravado and a desire for bragging rights lose them a battle-or, more often, result in unnecessary destruction of valuable slaves and plunder.",

			"While larger tribes are usually ruled by a jarl or another powerful figure, in smaller tribes a raider might serve as a leader. Some raiders could even be chieftains who pledge fealty to a mighty jarl's larger clan. Since a frost giant tribe ruled by a mere raider is likely to be easy pickings for a more fearsome tribe looking to increase its holdings, raider-led tribes often find it safer to move out of their traditional homelands and into softer country, and thus they often come into conflict with smaller humanoids.",

			"#### Description",
			"",
			"While mundane variations of this fungus exist in nature as small, fist-sized clusters that feed from the roots of host trees, the much larger, mobile giant devil's tooth seems to draw its powers from far darker sources. Some say the trees that give these fungi life contain the souls of ancient evil druids, imprisoned centuries ago for disgracing their circle. Others believe that devils themselves embedded infernal energy into the mushrooms while visiting the Material Plane, bringing these otherwise harmless hydnoids to life.",
			"",
			"A ruthless creature with many ways to incapacitate its prey, a giant devil's tooth often paralyzes its victims before slowly dissolving them for feeding. It crawls along the ground toward its quarry, and then rises up, revealing a large patch of jagged spines that it can eject in a devastating cone. When faced with multiple enemies, it releases a cloud of noxious spores before slowly moving in for the kill. The acidic globules that cover the surface of its cap provide it a self-defense mechanism against any would-be attackers that fight in close quarters.",
			"",
			"A giant devil's tooth can grow as tall as 24 feet and weighs 3,300 pounds.",
			"",
			"The giant devil's tooth is often found in densely forested areas, where it begins as a seemingly normal devil's tooth fungus engaged in a symbiotic relationship with a tree's root system. Rarely, however, such a fungus grows many times larger than normal, as it becomes infused with evil, turning into a parasite of its host tree. Once the creature grows to full size and has exhausted its host tree's resources, it detaches from the root system and crawls about the forest looking for more lively and nutrient-dense sources of food. While few forest animals are a match for the giant devil's tooth, the fungus seems to prefer to hunt intelligent humanoids, leading many to believe that it derives some of its terrible power from such prey. Whether this taste for humanoids developed over time or was imbued in them at their creation is an issue of debate among scholars.",
			"",
			"Though not known to be a particularly intelligent creature, the giant devil's tooth is a tactical predator. First paralyzing or nauseating its victims to negate their most dangerous attacks, it then attempts to bludgeon prey into a nutritious paste with devastating slams. Clumps of forest-floor detritus stick to its pale flesh, which contains traces of a paralytic poison that can immobilize living creatures it touches, while the blood-red acidic globules covering its cap readily burst when hit, spraying nearby creatures.",
			"",
			"Rumors abound of alchemical uses for the giant devil's tooth \"blood\": some say the substance can be mixed with other rare reagents to provide a source of great healing, while others believe its essence can be used as a component for infernal rituals. However, the volatile nature of the liquid, along with the tremendous difficulty of obtaining it, makes rigorous testing all but impossible.",
			"",
			"The origin of these creatures is still a source of great mystery to most, as few who venture into the heart of the territory of a giant devil's tooth manage to make it out alive. If this were a mere unintelligent fungus roaming about looking for food, similar to other living aberrant plants, there would be less speculation. Over the years, however, clerics, paladins, and other holy warriors who have come into contact with a giant devil's tooth have reported that the creatures radiate a definite aura of evil, thus lending credence to many of the dark theories surrounding their creation. In addition, numerous druidic and shamanic texts detail rituals in which dishonored members of a circle are put to death and fused with an element of nature, usually a tree, as penance for disgracing their fellow disciples. Such trees often exert an unnatural influence on their environs, including the fungi that feed from their roots, but it is unknown whether this is sufficient to produce a giant devil's tooth. The idea that devils have a hand in the creature's creation appears most often in stories told to children to keep them from wandering too far into the forest and eating suspicious mushrooms-few truly subscribe to the notion that the denizens of Hell have a hand in bringing the evil fungi to life.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"A giant devil's tooth is almost always a solitary predator, and while seeing a group of mundane devil's tooth fungi is rarely considered a good omen, it is not necessarily a guarantee that a larger one is nearby. The host tree that gives life to a giant devil's tooth ultimately becomes an eerie curiosity of nature; when the fungus finally detaches from the tree's root, the tree shrivels and turns gray, taking on an almost rubbery texture, as if the evil fungus imparted some of its essence to the tree as it grew. Some believe that felling the tree that spawned a giant devil's tooth will kill the fungus, but in truth, once the giant devil's tooth has detached itself, there is no remaining connection between the two.",
			"",
			"In the rare instances that a giant devil's tooth is killed, any attempts to harvest its potentially alchemically valuable globules invariably fail, as the creature undergoes an unnaturally sped-up process of decomposition. When the fungus dies, its mysterious pools of red liquid lose their surface tension and quickly seep into the cap and stem, all of which dissolves in a matter of minutes, leaving behind a large mass of noxious pink sludge.",
			"",
			"Giant devil's tooth sightings are most common in the Inner Sea region, especially in the Fangwood, the Shudderwood, and the Verduran Forest in Avistan, but there have been sightings as far as the Forest of Spirits, far over the Crown of the World in Tian Xia. With its tolerance for a broad range of temperatures and a minimal need for water, a giant devil's tooth could potentially thrive in any forest where it is left unchecked by more powerful creatures."

			"**Engulf (Ex)** If a giant flytrap begins its turn with an opponent at least two size categories smaller than itself grappled in one of its mouths, it can close its jaws completely around the foe by making a new combat maneuver check (as though attempting to pin the foe). If it succeeds, it engulfs the prey and inflicts 1d8+7 points of damage and 2d6 acid damage as the cavity floods with digestive enzymes. The seal formed is airtight, so an engulfed creature risks suffocation. Engulf is a special form of pinning, and an engulfed creature can escape in the same way as he can from being pinned, but since an engulfed creature is contained wholly inside the plant's jaws, the flytrap's victim cannot be targeted by effects or attacks that require line of sight or line of effect. A giant flytrap that is grappling or pinning a foe cannot attack other targets with that bite, but is not otherwise hindered.",
			"",
			"#### Description",
			"",
			"A hardy plant that grows in areas with poor soil but abundant animal life, this dangerous predator is an immense version of its more common (and much smaller) kin. Whereas the smaller flytraps supplement their growth by catching insects, the giant flytrap does the same with animals, humanoids, and anything else foolish enough to draw too near. Local legends call this plant names like \"mancatcher,\" \"snapperjaw plant,\" \"dragonleaf plant,\" \"cowbiter,\" and \"green gulper,\" but adventurers know it simply as the giant flytrap.",
			"",
			"As the giant flytrap's prey are generally much smarter than insects, this huge plant has evolved into a much more aggressive hunter than its smaller brethren. It can lumber slowly along the ground, using its writhing roots like tentacles to relocate to more populous hunting grounds, and is quite canny at blending in with the surrounding foliage. A giant flytrap's jaws and stalks are swift-moving-it reaches out and snaps at passersby with lightning speed. The plant itself even has a modicum of intelligence, and is capable of limited tactical choices, such as knowing when to break off an attack against a powerful foe.",
			"",
			"While most giant flytraps have four sets of jaws, some can have as few as one, and others eight or more. As a general rule, you should increase a giant flytrap's HD by 2 and its natural armor bonus by +1 for each additional bite attack you give it, increasing its CR by +1 for each time you increase its attacks and HD in this manner. If you increase the plant by more than 3 or 4 bites (and thus by more than 6 or 8 Hit Dice), consult Table: Monster Statistics by CR to make sure that the plant's CR remains appropriate.",
			"",
			"A giant flytrap's stalks are 20 feet long, but generally sprawl relatively close to the central mass-a set of full-grown flytrap jaws is 7 feet across. A giant flytrap weighs 9,000 pounds."

This disc is surrounded by a thicket of tendrils that vary in thickness from fine, hairlike cilia to thick, swollen appendages. The creature uses all of these tentacles at once when it attacks prey. Like their smaller kin, giant sea anemones come in a broad spectrum of colors-many are known for their brilliant hues.",

Massive sea anemones big enough to eat dolphins, whales, or even sea serpents reportedly exist in the deepest parts of the ocean.

			"",
			"Other species of sea anemones exist as well, some smaller but most quite a bit larger and favoring different oceanic regions and depths. You can adjust the stats for the giant sea anemone by changing the Hit Dice and size (adjusting Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution as appropriate) to represent a wide range of species. Often, different species have additional abilities, such as the darkforest anemone's constriction attack, or the deep tiger's ability to squirt acid.

			"",
			"What strange influence might have caused the first giant slugs to grow to such monstrous proportions is unknown, but today, giant slugs breed true and birth their oversized offspring after a fleshy, squirming courtship ritual. After mating, a female giant slug lays just over a hundred eggs, each approximately a foot in diameter. The mother slug guards this clutch fiercely and aggressively attacks any creatures that wander too close. Giant slugs inhabiting swamps aboveground mate once a year, and those who live in the area know better than to go into the swamps during this month.",
			"",
			"Deep below ground, some subterranean races use giant slugs as mounts or guardians. Creatures like mites, who have a strange empathy with vermin, can be used to keep giant slugs docile, but in most cases, those who would use giant slugs must do so with great care, keeping them well fed until they are needed for battle. Frightened whispers report armies of troglodytes using giant slugs as siege mounts. One particularly disturbing tale mentions a vast underground cavern inhabited by scores of skum and aboleth-controlled aquatic giant slugs with strange, mind-numbing abilities infused into their acidic saliva."

The undersides of each of the giant starfish's arms are lined with thousands of small tube feet that propel it along and aid in grappling and pinning its prey. The tube feet at the end of the arms are also sensory organs, detecting scents and textures. The starfish moves via a water vascular system, drawing in ocean water and pumping the water throughout its body and out to its tube feet. Because of this, the giant starfish is highly dependent on water to remain mobile and alive.",
			"",
			"The giant starfish can be an active hunter, relentlessly attacking marine mammals and coastal avian life alike, but just as often it lies in wait along the water's edge for its prey to venture into reach. When attacking, the giant starfish latches on with up to three of its arms and attempts to pin its opponent. It then extends its stomach outside of its inner cavity in order to begin digesting the pinned or grappled creature. The giant starfish's stomach can also shoot out as an elongated tubelike stalk to strike potential prey up to 20 feet away. When the series of barbed hooks at the end of the stomach stalk catch the targeted creature, the starfish begins to pull it closer, in order to more thoroughly secure its meal with its multiple arms. A giant starfish can have anywhere from five to 24 arms, and while the total number of arms can result in a wildly different-looking creature, the number of limbs has no effect on its statistics since a giant starfish of any size can attack with only up to three of its limbs at a time.",

The giant sundew exudes an unmistakable scent of honey-an attractive odor that often proves irresistible to nearby creatures.",
			"",
			"Although the giant sundew is not quite a mindless monstrosity, its intellect is barely more than instinctive, and it has little ability to discern between allies and enemies. If it attacks a creature that is immune to acid or adhesive qualities, the sundew is smart enough to avoid attacking that foe in future rounds (although it continues to slam such targets with its fronds in self defense, if needed). Despite sundews' inability to form alliances, many more intelligent forest-dwelling creatures take advantage of the sticky plants and use them as organic traps to help gather prey. Will-o--wisps in particular are quite fond of the methods a sundew uses to capture and consume prey, for the anguish and fear of creatures stuck to a plant that is slowly dissolving and digesting them form quite a delicious tonic of horror for the wisps to feed upon.",

It's not uncommon to see a good cloud giant walking among humans, for example, in a human city near a tall mountain range. Evil cloud giants tend not to bother with permanent settlements and instead live on high peaks in crude shelters, only coming down to raid villages for whatever they might need. These two philosophies often see violent and long-lasting wars erupt between neighboring tribes.",
			"",
			"Legends abound of magical cloud giant cities nestled in the very clouds themselves that float with the winds and circumnavigate the world. While most cloud giants recognize this as a fantasy, there are some who not only claim to have seen them but have dedicated the entirety of their long lives to finding them again."

While in the presence of an eclipse, however, an eclipse giant becomes truly active, unlocking an inspired inner self that varies from giant to giant. While one eclipse giant might enter a violent frenzy and rage against the world and other creatures, another might produce a fragment of writing that will one day become one of the greatest plays of her generation, and another might solve a complex formula that predicts the celestial movements of the planets.",

They are, as a whole, incredibly selfish creatures and rarely engage in battles they don't automatically know they'll win. Hill giants are known for shoving one another at terrifying foes and won't hesitate to sacrifice a clanmate to save their own skins. Roving bands of hill giants are common in temperate hills, and their constant aggression makes them one of the more feared dangers in this climate.",

			"Solitary, non-evil hill giants are very rare but can sometimes be found in other humanoid societies, though they are almost never accepted in central cities or population centers. They do best as laborers and soldiers in outlying frontier towns, and often serve as rudimentary diplomats to negotiate with marauding hill giant bands. Unfortunately, hill giants who shed their racial lifestyle for civilization are mocked and often killed on sight by their nomadic brethren. Still, these \"civilized\" hill giants can find their place within society and many have managed to live peaceful, uneventful lives."

They keep their own counsel and practice their own mysterious religion, whose bloody rituals of autosacrifice and cannibalism are presided over by their bone-and-featheradorned shamans atop short-stepped pyramids constructed of dark basalt blocks. On the Shadow Plane, families of shadow giants have been known to combine together to form greater tribes when times of war are at hand. Such an army arrayed upon the field of battle is often enough to make enemies sue for peace with offers of gold and prisoners for sacrifice."

Proportioned more like stone giants than fire giants, slag giants have long limbs with lean muscles; they stand 14 feet tall and weigh 3,000 pounds. Slag giants' skin color ranges from a deep and ruddy hue to a rusty orange. Their hair is black, gray, or white, though males and females both tend to keep their hair cropped close or shaved off. Slag giants can live to be 400 years old.",
			"",
			"Slag giants usually evince a cold, detached attitude about everything other than their work. Their inherent understanding of metalworking and resistance to fire allow them to craft arms and armor from inside their huge forges, sometimes working the metal with their bare hands. Small families of slag giants often ally with clans of other giants, providing masterwork armor and weapons in exchange for ore and the freedom to practice their crafting skills in peace. Even militaristic fire giants (who pride themselves on their strength and martial prowess) respect the fine work of the weaker slag giants, and usually attempt to ally with the artisans rather than enslaving them.",
			"",
			"Slag giant settlements usually consist of several stone homes (built from or surrounded by forge slag) with built-in forges and large, smoking chimneys. Most are in hills or mountains, but they can be found anywhere there is a ready supply of iron ore. Although they prefer creation to combat, slag giants are brutal and efficient fighters, capable of destroying an enemy's weapons or armor in a few precise blows. They often let opponents retreat if it gives the giants the opportunity to collect any broken weapons and armor as salvage. If approached peacefully, they are willing to barter or sell their goods, though they usually don't have human-sized items on hand. Trespassers who carelessly or wantonly destroy a slag giant's work or foul its forge usually end up in the fire. Most settlements have several giant-sized breastplates the residents can don if they expect a serious fight."

			"",
			"#### Description",
			"",
			"Since the time Urgathoa first fled the Boneyard, there have been living creatures that have given their allegiance to powers that offer the promise of existence eternal. Tomb giants are an entire race of humanoids who have given themselves over to necromancy, and in so doing have gained sinister powers. These giants are born as the living agents of undeath, and they show great skill in creating all manner of undead creatures-even from their own kind. Tomb giants fully expect to be transformed after they die, though most don't have to worry about the cost of sacrificing their experiences and memories, for they know their brothers and sisters can raise intelligent undead much greater than shambling zombies or clattering skeletons.",
			"",
			"Tomb giants possess an alabaster complexion. They are devoid of all body hair and have smooth, rounded features and marbleized skin. Tomb giants often tattoo their pale skin with arcane symbols in stark black ink. The sclerae of their eyes are jet black, and ghostly white pupils glow in the centers. They move with an eerie, silent grace for humanoids of their size, and rarely talk unless it is necessary. Tomb giants favor simple clothing, typically wearing togas at home and hooded cloaks when they emerge from their shadowy lairs. The average tomb giant stands 11 to 13 feet tall and weighs approximately 1,300 pounds. Tomb giants can live for up to 400 years.",
			"",
			"Tomb giants were created as an offshoot of taiga giants, forged by a Runelord of Gluttony during Thassilon's rule. When this ancient necromancer discovered the taiga giants' ability to sense and direct the life energy that pulses through every living creature, he hid a number of them away a secret complex deep beneath Golarion's surface. Using a now-lost ritual, the runelord altered the essence of these specimens to create the first tomb giants. He wanted to use the new species of giants as a deadly army of necromancers against the other runelords, but the conniving Runelord of Gluttony died before he could enact his plan, and his project was lost to the mists of time. The tomb giants lingered in their isolation for generations before they began to spread throughout the Darklands.",
			"",
			"These days, tomb giants are born rather than created, though it would be a misnomer to call their procreation natural. The giants' adaptation to their unwholesome powers has come at a cost, for tomb giants have trouble conceiving except during a small window of time (not much longer than an hour) after they have drained a portion of the life energy from another living creature. It is therefore common for tomb giants to take prisoners and keep them on hand for when they wish to conceive children.",
			"",
			"Although tomb giants possess inherent powers of necromancy, they are not undead. They aren't particularly troubled by sunlight (aside from their tendency to sunburn), but they have an instinctual dislike of bright light and open spaces. They are omnivorous and have no qualms about consuming sentient humanoids. By the time tomb giants are 10 years old, they are as large as an adult human and are capable of hunting and fighting. They reach maturity by age 50 or 60, when they gain full use of their magical abilities. When tomb giants die, their families or friends often transform them into sentient undead creatures or use the deceased giants' parts in the creation of other undead abominations. Tomb giants view their mortal life spans much as humans view puberty: as merely one stage in the development of the individual. An undead tomb giant is likely to be valued as a family elder.",
			"",
			"For tomb giants, sentient undeath represents the perpetual continuation of self-identity, and is the highest hope for those still alive. Thus, some of the most feared tomb giant punishments consist of execution followed by the offender's transformation into a mindless undead. Such unfortunates are often turned into an eternal servant, and are sometimes passed down from generation to generation within families.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"Tomb giants prefer enclosed spaces and underground lairs. While tombs and crypts can serve as lairs, tomb giants are more commonly found in renovated cave systems near the surface and in scattered pockets in the Darklands.",
			"",
			"Tomb giants have no compunction about living among undead, but are circumspect about their own safety and well aware that some undead have no loyalty to the living. It's common to create undead horrors from the corpses of lesser creatures to use as servants or guards-smaller undead are often used as components for necrocrafts.",
			"",
			"Tomb giants are a secretive race, and go to extraordinary lengths to pursue and capture anyone they catch spying on them. Surrounding themselves with undead creatures (most of which are under their control) has provided the giants the secrecy they crave, as the dead don't utter secrets. Some folktales speak of silent, pale folk of impossible height who come out of the night in pursuit of a victim who has \"seen something no one should see.\" These stories have a grain of truth to them, and invariably end with the foolhardy individual vanished from his home, never to be seen again. Those few fortunate enough to have escaped with their lives bear scars of their interactions with the sinister giants, and survivors tell tales of pale giants who made light conversation with their victims while preparing to cook them. Darker tales hint at the tomb giants' perverse mating rituals, wherein chained victims are drained of their life force and left hanging on the walls, bearing witness to the giants' frenzied couplings before the pale creatures eat their weakened captives alive. Wherever these alabaster fiends tread, horror and madness is sure to follow."

			"",
			"#### Description",
			"",
			"Vault giants are gargantuan, bipedal lizards that live on the coast of the Sightless Sea of Orv, the lowest level of the Darklands. Their hands and feet are webbed, affording them great mobility in water, and they have powerfully built bodies capable of great feats of strength. In addition to their great size and physical power, vault giants are quick, logical thinkers who employ powerful psychic magic to study and overcome their foes. Despite their formidable natural weapons, vault giants prefer to wield massive, ornamented spears, which function effectively both above and below the surface of the Sightless Sea. Vault giants engage in great hunts, capturing and observing any new creatures they encounter before either consuming or releasing them, as dictated by their leaders.",
			"",
			"Vault giants adorn their scales with glowing, waterproof paint brewed from luminescent fungi. The painted markings come in a dizzying array of shapes and colors, displaying clan affiliation, status, and noteworthy personal deeds. A vault giant takes both individual and clan pride in these glowing designs, and mocking or defacing them is certain to earn a vault giant's ire.",
			"",
			"Vault giants are 42 feet tall and weigh 25,000 pounds.",
			"",
			"In the mysterious Age of Serpents, the vault giants' civilization spread across the shores of Golarion. Each vault giant clan raised mighty, translucent crystalline spires along the sea cliffs bordering its territory. Like the ancient xulgaths, vault giants were hard-pressed by usurper civilizations, most predominantly Thassilon and its rune giant servants. The divided nature of vault giant clan structure made them ill-prepared to resist a united empire. Thus, to this day, rune giants are hated foes in vault giant legends, and the reptilian giants attack rune giants on sight (though rune giants are rarely found in the deepest layers of the Darklands).",
			"",
			"When the vault giant clans were brought to the brink of extinction by Thassilon, their leaders struck a bargain with unnamed dark powers promising salvation. The clans surrendered their spires to the waves and journeyed deep into the sea. There, a passage led them to the shores of the Sightless Sea of Orv, where the vault giants made their new homes. They have adapted well to subterranean life and hunt the great beasts that roam the depths of the Sightless Sea for sustenance. Modern vault giants do not differ physically from their surface-dwelling ancestors, except that their once-vibrant aquamarine scales have paled over time. To compensate, vault giants paint themselves with glowing designs that show clan affiliation and personal status.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"Vault giant clans build strongholds on the shores of the Sightless Sea. While most reside on the outer shores, some powerful clans claim steep, rocky islands. From the outside, vault giant clanholds resemble natural stone, with cunningly concealed openings for lookouts. The main entrance of a vault giant clanhold is always underwater, although the interior has portions both above and below sea level. On the inside, the structure is carefully designed to accommodate the entire clan, with defensive structures near the entrance to resist attack from rival clans or other creatures. Vault giants use the same glowing paint with which they adorn their bodies to decorate and mark the rooms inside a clanhold, including the communal heated baths where the giants sleep.",
			"",
			"Vault giant society is strict and ritualistic. A giant's role within the clan is established by his actions, and each giant knows the rituals and tasks that will cause his status within the clan to rise or fall. Each clan is led by a circle of powerful female psychics. The circle communes with the dark entities they serve and consults with the governing circles from other clans to decide the direction for vault giant raids and expeditions. A female vault giant who hears the psychic call to join a circle dives deep into the Sightless Sea. She returns changed many years later, with psychic abilities surpassing those of her ordinary kin-if she returns at all. Members of the circle do not age like others of their kind, but are eventually drawn back into the depths of the sea, never to be seen again.",
			"",
			"Beyond the ruling circle, vault giant clans assign roles to their members according to individual talents, regardless of gender. Vault giant culture places the unity of the clan above familial ties. The clans decree who mates with whom and when, and females lay their eggs in a clan's communal hatchery. Vault giant eggs mature slowly, taking a year to hatch; offspring that hatch too quickly usually have deformities and are destroyed. The whole clan is responsible for guiding healthy children to adulthood - which they reach at the age of 30 - and for teaching them combat and psychic magic along the way. Vault giants can live for several hundred years.",
			"",
			"Vault giants place the survival of their clan above all else, and self-image is closely tied to status in the clan. The worst punishment a vault giant can receive is exile. An exile's markings of status are erased, and the individual is sent alone away from the Sightless Sea. Vault giants deprived of their clan become psychotic and usually seek out a group of smaller creatures to bully into submission-often, a tribe of degenerate troglodytes. This leadership is a pale shadow of the sense of belonging the giant felt within the clan, and these giants often vent their frustrations in mighty rages.",
			"",
			"In their interactions with other intelligent denizens of the Sightless Sea, such as aboleths, munavris, and urdefhans, vault giants seem to operate according to an inscrutable agenda. They might raid one settlement, lavish gifts upon another, or raze yet another to the ground and take all of its inhabitants as prisoners. Intelligent captives receive equally erratic treatment: they might be eaten in a communal feast or set free in a distant corner of Orv. Vault giants are cautious when they meet unfamiliar intelligent creatures for the first time, preferring to take them captive until they receive instructions from their leaders. Vault giants know only that they loyally follow the orders of their psychic circle; few realize that these powerful psychics take their commands in turn from unknown masters far below the Sightless Sea."

			"Walruses normally have gray or brown hides, fading to nearly white when immersed in cold water, and turning pink from increased blood flow when basking in the sun. A thick layer of blubber serves as protection from both predators and cold.",
			"",
			"A typical male walrus weighs 1 to 2 tons and measures 10 feet in length, with females about a third lighter and about 9 feet long. Both sexes have tusks up to 3 feet long, and stiff whiskers used to feel out the hiding places of shellfish. A walrus lives up to 40 years.",
			"",
			"Owing to their fearsome tusks, prodigious strength, and willingness to fight as a herd, only the most aggressive or hungry polar predators risk attacking an adult walrus. People hunt walruses for meat and for their tusks, valued for their worth as ivory and as impressive trophies in their own right."

			"**Blind (Ex)** A wamp lacks eyes and \"sees\" exclusively through its blindsight ability, which is based on a combination of sound, body heat, and the natural growth and decay of matter. It is considered blind beyond 60 feet. It is invulnerable to all sight-based attacks and effects, including gaze attacks.",
			"",
			"**Disease (Ex)** A wamp's bite attack infects those it damages with disease. For most wamps, this is a virulent form of zombie rot, but in some cases, a wamp can inflict foes with other undeath-related contagions, such as ghoul fever.",
			"",
			"Zombie Rot: Bite-injury; save Fort DC 19; onset 1 round; frequency 12 hours; effect 1d2 Con, this damage cannot be healed while the creature is infected; cure 2 consecutive saves. Any creature that dies while infected rises as a plague zombie in 2d6 hours. The save DC is Constitution-based.",
			"",
			"**Feign Undeath (Ex)** Although the wamp is a living creature, it registers as an undead creature for the purposes of the spell detect undead. As a swift action, a wamp can attempt to trick an undead creature into thinking the wamp is itself undead-to do so, it attempts a Disguise check opposed by the target undead creature's Perception check. A successful Disguise check allows the wamp to maintain the facade against that undead creature for 24 hours before being forced to make a new check. This ability lets the wamp move relatively unhindered among unintelligent undead, but intelligent undead who understand the threat a wamp presents are unlikely to be fooled by this deception for long. This ability does not allow the wamp to be healed by negative energy; it is harmed by such attacks (and healed by positive energy) as per normal for a living creature. It does grant the wamp a +4 bonus on all saving throws made against attacks and effects generated by undead creatures, regardless of whether its trickery has worked on that particular undead creature.",
			"",
			"**Swift Infection (Su)** All diseases a wamp inflicts on creatures have no onset time, and those who are infected with such a disease must attempt saving throws to avoid its effects twice as frequently as normal for that disease.",
			"",
			"#### Description",
			"",
			"Wamps dwell in the dead cities of the Dreamlands, particularly within necropolises or undead-haunted graveyards, where they can hunt their favored prey-unliving creatures with decaying flesh-with ease. A wamp is a vaguely arachnid creature, albeit one with nine legs that end in webbed feet colored a brilliant red, as if the creature had just finished wading through a pool of fresh gore. The wamp's face combines the least attractive features of a pig and a bat, but without the eyes. Covered with bristly pale fur save for their crimson feet, wamps often invite comparison to blood-smeared bones due to their coloration. Wamps often chuckle and chortle as they draw near their prey, eschewing ambush tactics in favor of a more disturbing opening volley of mockery designed to let their victims know that they have been marked for death-yet wamps are not foolish. Against canny foes, wamps can be as silent as the grave before springing to the attack.",
			"",
			"A wamp's body is 4 feet in diameter, but its 3-foot-long limbs give it a gangly leg span of 8 feet. It weighs 300 pounds and typically carries with it the faint and unsettling stench of rotting flesh.",
			"",
			"The wamp requires corruption of the flesh, both to survive and to procreate. It cannot digest fresh meat and prefers to feed on carrion it discovers or the flesh of corporeal undead creatures. Most wamps are not averse to slaying living victims they encounter, but they won't feed on the bodies for several days. Instead, they drag the corpses back to their dens to ripen before slurping the spongy, rotting flesh from the bones.",
			"",
			"When a wamp feeds on a dead body of at least Small size in this manner, it deposits hundreds of tiny eggs within the flesh, laying them in the decay through the very act of feeding. If a wamp leaves a body mostly unconsumed, these eggs quicken in the festering mess left behind and eventually start to absorb one other. When only one egg remains-having grown into a large mass of pale protoplasmic jelly-it hatches and a newborn wamp emerges. A newly hatched wamp is the size of a watermelon, but it grows quickly and achieves full size in a matter of hours. Once fully grown, a wamp can live for hundreds of years, although most succumb far sooner to violence, for their habits and methods often inspire disgust and retaliation among those they encounter. Fortunately for the enemies of wamps, these creatures are always ravenous and rarely leave behind enough meat on the bones of those they feed upon to spawn offspring.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"Despite its alien form, hideous diet, and grim reproductive cycle, the average wamp should not be underestimated, for it is smarter and more curious than the average human. These creatures dwell in dead cities not only because these sites are often infested with delicious undead to feed on and spawn from, but also because such locales often feature a host of old carvings, forgotten libraries, and other cultural relics that can intrigue the mind. The fact that wamps, despite their lack of sight, manage to absorb the ancient lore of their favorite haunts and, over time, become expert historians of the ruins in which they dwell has long baffled scholars, for how could a creature who cannot see read old books or peruse ancient carvings? In truth, the wamp can see the natural decay inherent in all solidity, be it the rot of dead flesh, the erosion that affects carved stone walls, or the different rates of mildewing of paper and ink on printed pages over the passage of eons.",
			"",
			"It can be a dangerous but productive pursuit to consult wamps on the lore they have gathered, for they are often eager to divulge the secrets they've learned to visitors, if only as a way to brag about what they've discovered. Curious scholars are advised to keep such sessions with a wamp short, for many find themselves becoming a wamp's eventual meal not long after serving as its audience. Keeping a wamp interested in the conversation may require numerous successful DC 15 Knowledge checks, or perhaps Bluff checks if the converser is seeking only to distract.",
			"",
			"It seems that the nature of the particular ruins within which a wamp dwells might affect how the creature grows in power, as the types of lore left behind on carved stone walls or hidden in forgotten libraries can serve as primary sources of inspiration. Most wamps gain levels as sorcerers, psychics, or even rogues, bards, or clerics (they favor the worship of the Great Old One Tsathoggua), with those who gain the ability to cast arcane spells always seeking the Eschew Materials feat to combat the fact that wamps find it difficult to manipulate material components with their webbed feet. Other wamps simply grow more powerful by increasing in size and Hit Dice-rumors of wamps of up to colossal size persist in some regions.",
			"",
			"### Origins",
			"",
			"In his novella \"The Dream-Quest of Unknown Kadath,\" H. P. Lovecraft mentions wamps briefly, describing them as \"web-footed creatures that are spawned in dead cities\" that the ghouls prefer to avoid, while leaving the rest up to the reader's imagination. In Chaosium's Dreamlands expansion to the Call of Cthulhu RPG, they drew upon the writings of Clark Ashton Smith for further inspiration in shaping that game's version of the wamp (in Smith's short story, \"The Abominations of Yondo,\" a strange nine-legged creature makes an appearance but is not called out directly as a wamp). It is upon the Chaosium version that this incarnation of the dreaded wamp is based."
