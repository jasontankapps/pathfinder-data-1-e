			"Even among mystical practitioners, the animist has a strange perspective and even stranger magic. The animist perceives that all things have a spirit, including objects, constructs, illnesses, buildings, and the environment.",
			"",
			"**Animist Spirit Magic:** The animist adds the following spells to the list of spells he can cast using spirit magic: speak with animals (1st), skinsend (2nd), speak with plants (3rd), malfunction (4th), dream (5th), speak with stone (6th), control construct (7th), trap the soul (8th), soul bind (9th). This ability replaces the spirit magic spells gained from the shaman's spirit.",
			"",
			"**Wrangle Condition (Su):** At 2nd level, the animist interacts directly with unwholesome spirits of the ills that trouble him or his people. To the animist, negative conditions manifest as anthropomorphic spirits or are caused by such spirits (visited upon the creature by bad magic). Either way, the animist can attempt to persuade the spirit to leave its victim alone, thus performing a miraculous healing. As the animist grows in power, he can simply inform these spirits that they are unwelcome and command them to depart.",
			"",
			"The animist can attempt a Diplomacy check to persuade the condition's spirit to leave. Conditions the animist can affect are ranked from minor to dire, with each category having an accompanying Diplomacy DC (see below). The animist cannot take 10 or 20 on the check or receive aid from any creature except another shaman. Failure by 5 or less means the condition spirit is willing to leave the target and transfer to the animist for the rest of the duration or until cured; this happens only if the animist is willing. Failure by 10 or more means that not only is the target inflicted with the condition, but the animist is as well (whether or not he is willing) for the remaining duration or until cured.",

			"",
			"**Dire Conditions (DC 30):** Blinded, deafened, paralyzed, and stunned.",
			"",
			"The animist can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 1/2 his shaman level + his Wisdom modifier. Using this ability is a standard action that requires no contact or shared language with the target, but it relies on audible components and the target must be within 30 feet. If a target is afflicted with multiple conditions, the animist targets one condition at a time (of her choosing). The animist cannot use this ability on himself.",
			"",
			"At 5th level, the animist can use this ability to exorcise minor conditions without needing to attempt a Diplomacy check. He can dispatch major conditions without a roll at 9th level, severe conditions at 13th level, and dire conditions at 17th level. Doing so still requires one use of this ability per condition.",

			"",
			"**Exorcism (Su):** At 8th level, the animist can attempt to end effects that control a creature or object, such as magic jar, possess object, dominate person, and dominate monster, or possessing entities such as ghosts. This is a full-round action that requires the animist to touch the target. The possessing or dominating creature must attempt a Will save with a DC equal to 10 + 1/2 the shaman level + her Wisdom modifier. Failure means that the controlling effect ends or the entity is immediately cast out of the target, as appropriate. If the possessing entity is exorcised, it cannot attempt to dominate or possess that target again for 24 hours. The animist can exorcise the same entity out of different targets, but once the entity successfully saves against the animist's exorcism, it cannot be affected by this ability again for 24 hours. This ability replaces the hex gained at 8th level.",
			"",
			"**Dominate Spirit (Sp):** At 10th level, the animist can attempt to possess creatures or objects as magic jar or possess object. When the animist is attempting to possess the creature, his familiar acts as the jar and must be within 10 feet when the animist attempts to possess a creature. The animist's soul can perceive his surroundings through the familiar's senses, clearly evaluate potential targets for possession, and communicate with his familiar telepathically. The familiar retains its autonomy while acting as the jar, and is not harmed by being used as a vessel for the animist's soul. The animist can use this ability once per day at 10th level, plus an additional time per day every 4 levels thereafter. This ability replaces the hex gained at 10th level.",
			"",
			"**Contact with the Spirit World (Su):** At 12th level, the shaman can interact with incorporeal entities as if his unarmed strikes and melee weapons had the ghost touch weapon special ability. While using this ability, he can also see nearby ethereal entities and likewise strike at them as if they were incorporeal. He can use this ability for a number of rounds per day equal to his shaman level. The rounds need not be consecutive. This ability replaces the hex gained at 12th level.",
			"",
			"**Etherealness (Sp):** At 18th level, the animist can cast etherealness once per day as a spell-like ability. This ability replaces the hex gained at 18th level.",
			"",
			"**Spirit Shaman (Sp):** At 20th level, the animist can use ethereal jaunt as at will as a spell-like ability, and cast astral projection once per day as a spell-like ability. This ability replaces manifestation."

All creatures that participate in the ritual (including the benefactor) gain a boon reservoir with a number of points equal to 1/2 the benefactor's shaman level (minimum 1) for 24 hours. As an immediate action, a creature can spend 1 point from its boon reservoir to gain a +2 insight bonus on all saving throws it attempts until the start of its next turn. Boon reservoir points that are not spent within 24 hours are wasted.",
			"",
			"**Expanded Boon (Su):** When a benefactor gains this hex, she chooses one of the following: ability checks, attack rolls, or skill checks. Instead of gaining an insight bonus on saving throws, any creature with a boon reservoir granted by the benefactor can spend 1 point as an immediate action to gain a +2 insight bonus on rolls or checks of the chosen kind until the start of its next turn. This hex can be chosen multiple times. Each time, it applies to a different roll or check. A benefactor must have the boon reservoir hex before choosing this hex.",
			"",
			"**Suppress Curse (Sp):** As a standard action, a benefactor can attempt to suppress one curse effect that is affecting a creature or object with a touch. This functions as per remove curse, except the curse's effects are suppressed for 1 hour, even if it is a cursed shield, weapon, or suit of armor. This allows a creature afflicted with any such cursed item to remove or get rid of it. The benefactor uses her shaman level as her caster level for the purpose of this hex."

When selecting her wandering spirit, she can forgo gaining a spirit ability to instead grant herself and her spirit animal DR 1/adamantine as long as they're within 10 feet of one another. While benefiting from this ability, the crystal tender's skin takes on a crystalline sheen.

The crystal tender's spirit animal can also embed a number of ioun stones equal to the crystal tender's Charisma modifier into its crystalline form.

She can use this ability for 1 hour per shaman level each day, divided any way she chooses in 1 hour increments, though the spell's breath weapon limit applies across the whole day.
