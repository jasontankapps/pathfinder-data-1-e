Alert to the hobgoblin threat, the elves located the artifact at the center of the colony and stole it; when the owners caught up to the elves, they battled, and in the confusion the artifact was lost. Since that time the hobgoblins have been their own masters and the names of the being or beings who thought up their creation have been lost.

This water is pure and clean and replenishes itself at a rate of one gallon per minute. Through an attunement process that takes several days of active concentration (similar to crafting a magic item) you can give the spring magical powers so that any who drink from it will be permanently affected, though there are usually slight side effects (for example, if the water enhances Dexterity, a drinker may gain cat-like features).",
			"",
			"Many stories of magical fountains or springs crystal rests at the bottom and is obscured by plants or sediment, and it is possible that several variant races or subraces owe their existence to this artifact. The power of the spring tends to drift over time, requiring attention at least one day out of every month. Furthermore, the staff has been known to create a spring without its owner commanding it to do so. If the staff is removed from the spring, the water usually loses its magical powers and eventually drains away, though the Bouldertop Oasis in northern Osirion has no natural explanation and has a faint magical aura reminiscent of the Cantorian Spring."

The life-like legs aren't the only thing that make the hut remarkable, however. The small building's only door opens into a room that can be significantly larger than what the structure can naturally contain, for the hut possesses countless configurations of extradimensional rooms that change depending on the hut's physical location. Nothing that transpires outside the hut has any effect on those inside. The properties and abilities of the Dancing Hut are divided into two categories: the defensive and the transportive.",
			"",
			"**Defensive:** At its most basic level, the Dancing Hut is a unique CR 17 construct. The statistics and abilities of this remarkable creation are detailed below. A creature inside the hut can command the structure to move, attack, use its special abilities, or immediately perform any other function it is capable of by employing the Dancing Hut's unusual controls, which consist of a brown hen's egg inside a simple, cracked clay bowl sitting upon a table inside the hut. Both the bowl and egg can easily be removed or destroyed, but both reappear 1 hour later and only function within the confines of the hut. Breaking the egg reveals the head of live and very irate rooster that dies a long, squawking death-and disappears an hour later when the controls reform. Any creature that makes a successful DC 30 Use Magic Device check can use these innocuous controls to command the Dancing Hut. Failing this check causes the hut to dance erratically, potentially trampling creatures nearby, but has no effect on creatures inside the hut. A creature must succeed at a new Use Magic Device check every round to directly control the hut's actions. The hut can be assigned simple, standing commands to follow, such as to attack any humanoid that approaches, to patrol an area, to head in a direction for a set period, or to flee if damaged, but cannot be assigned commands that require it to follow multipart instructions, recognize specific individuals, or seek a specific place.",
			"",
			"**Transportive:** As a construct, the Dancing Hut can physically move on its own, but it also possesses the ability to slip between planes and even travel to other planets, carrying any inside the hut with it. This remarkable ability is activated using the cauldron within the hut, which links the hut to countless-if not infinite-locations across the planes. To use these transportive abilities, a creature must stand before the hut's cauldron, place two ingredients inside, and stir the ever-bubbling stew within-a process requiring a full-round action, though finding the desired ingredients might take longer. The two ingredients act as \"keys\" to a specific destination. Each destination the hut can travel to has a specific combination, or \"recipe,\" of two keys, which appear to be relatively normal items stored throughout the hut itself. Although the keys appear to be absolutely mundane, only those specific items within the hut function as keys. So while a red apple might be one key, it must be the red apple found inside the Dancing Hut, not just any apple. Like the hut's controls, keys can easily be destroyed or removed from the hut, but they reappear 1 hour later. In the Reign of Winter Adventure Path, Queen Elvanna has deactivated the keys within the hut to keep anyone from stealing the hut and taking it away from Golarion. Throughout the campaign, the PCs seek out additional keys hidden by Baba Yaga that enable them to control the hut. Since these additional keys were not present in the hut when Elvanna deactivated them, once brought into the hut, these new keys function exactly as would the keys normally found in the hut, in all cases. At no point during the campaign do any of the deactivated keys function; if placed within the hut's cauldron, they simply disappear and reappear, still deactivated, 1 hour later. Until the PCs rescue Baba Yaga, who can reactivate the keys within the hut, the only way to use the Dancing Hut's transportive abilities is with the extra keys left behind by Baba Yaga.",
			"",
			"Once the proper keys have been placed in the cauldron, the Dancing Hut immediately appears at its new destination, as if it had traveled there via plane shift or interplanetary teleport. The hut always appears in the same location at a given destination-the keys are tied to that specific location. Once at a destination, the Dancing Hut can move (or be moved) normally to any other location on that world or plane. Once the hut arrives at its new destination, the keys immediately disappear from the cauldron, reforming elsewhere in the hut.",
			"",
			"Each time a new combination of keys is used to transport the Dancing Hut to a new location, the interior layout of the hut changes, as each location to which the hut can travel has its own corresponding layout of the hut's interior. As the hut travels, these layouts can change dramatically, though every layout contains one room with a cauldron and the hut's controls, regardless of how many other rooms are present in that layout.",
			"",
			"When the Dancing Hut's layout changes, the other layouts still exist, but are inaccessible from within the hut itself. Magic such as plane shift can still be used to visit these otherwise inaccessible layouts, and Baba Yaga herself (as well as certain other residents of the hut) can freely travel throughout all of the rooms of the hut, regardless of the hut's physical location.",

Their runewells are perhaps the most notorious of these artifacts, though others, like the Runeforge, exist. But they learned this technique from the artifacts of those who preceded them. The Everdawn Pool is one such artifact. Unlike magical pools created by the runelords, it needs no well as a container-it is a 30-foot-diameter sphere of roiling, churning blood in which brief glimpses of limbs and faces (not all of them humanoid) constantly form and dissolve.",

What seems certain is that she-and later, other runelords-were able to reverse engineer some of the Everdawn Pool's properties and build pools of power of their own. In many cases, these pools even surpassed the Everdawn Pool. Certainly, the power of [Karzoug's Runewell of Greed](magic-artifact/runewell_of_greed) exceeds that of the Everdawn Pool, as would, one would guess, the runewells created by those more powerful than him (Xanderghul, Alaznist, and Sorshen). Yet the Everdawn Pool remains the first. It provided a legacy that helped shape all of Thassilon, and was a significant part of what gave Sorshen the boost in power to claim and keep the role of Runelord of Lust for the duration of that ancient empire.",

			"The Everdawn Pool requires specially prepared blood to function. A single drop of blood and one 12-hour ritual performed by any character capable of casting 9th-level spells who succeeds at a DC 30 Spellcraft check is enough to awaken the pool and grant it 1 charge. Additional charges can be stored in the Everdawn Pool by performing this ritual multiple times, but only one such ritual can be performed at any one time (effectively limiting the Everdawn Pool's capacity to be recharged to a rate of no more than 2 charges per day).

The creature can still observe only one location at a time, but can switch locations as a move action. As a side effect, a creature that has been so infused can use teleport effects within the Sunken Queen without restriction.

In Ileosa's case, life created using this power manifests as a [taniniver](monster/taniniver). Creatures created by other NPCs (or even PCs) should be selected and customized as needed by the GM to represent the source.

Once the user has spent 100 charges in this manner, and as long as all 100 charges were spent within the span of a single year, all of those creatures that provided blood samples drop dead, and for each donor that dies, the user ceases to age for 1 year.

The Everdawn Pool can attempt to save against this effect (it has a total Will save bonus of +18 against this specific effect). If it resists, the Everdawn Pool absorbs the mortal, effectively destroying the mortal as if via a [sphere of annihilation](magic-artifact/sphere_of_annihilation); in this event, further attempts to destroy the pool require new samples of blood drawn from different creatures than those whose blood was used for the previous attempt. If the Everdawn Pool is successfully plane shifted to the Negative Energy Plane, the energies of that plane swiftly destroy the pool and deal 20d20 points of negative energy damage to the creature that transported the pool in the first place (Fortitude DC 30 half)."

			"- **The Betrayal:** The character's animal companion, familiar, cohort, or other NPC ally is alienated and forever after hostile. If the character has no such allies, the enmity of some powerful personage, community, or religious order can be substituted. This hatred remains a secret until such a time that it might be most dramatically and perilously revealed. Upon drawing this card, the character knows that someone or something will turn against him, but nothing more.",

			"- **The Dance:** From this point on, whenever the character rolls initiative, he rolls twice and selects whichever result he prefers.",
			"- **The Demon's Lantern:** The character's body disintegrates. All that remains are his items and a glowing gem containing his soul. This gem is worth an amount of gp equal to 2,500 &times; the character's level. A resurrection or stronger spell is required to restore the character, and doing so destroys the gem.",
			"- **The Desert:** This card grants the character the one-time ability to travel to any location on the same plane instantly, bringing with him up to 10 allies and 2,000 pounds of goods. The character must know exactly where he wishes to travel, such as a place he has been or a location on a map, but not a vague or hidden location, like the richest dungeon in the world or the Lost City of Ird. This transportation ignores all barriers against teleportation or other magical effects. The character may use this card's effect whenever he wishes, but only once.",

Any credit a character does not spend is lost. After the character is done spending his credit, the Foreign Trader vanishes. Years taken by the Foreign Trader cannot be restored by any means.

Any gp value not spent is lost.",
			"- **The Eclipse:** From the hours of dusk to dawn, the character is treated as being one level lower than normal. If the character has multiple classes, he must decide upon drawing this card which class is affected.",

Whether the information revealed can be effectively acted upon is another question entirely. The character may use this card's effect whenever he wishes, but only once.",
			"- **The Idiot:** The character's Charisma, Intelligence, and Wisdom scores are all reduced by 1d4 points. Roll individually for each ability score.",

The card does not grant the character or creature questioned any special insight, so a creature might still answer a question falsely if it believes the falsehood. If the creature is truly ignorant, it informs the character that it doesn't know the answer and this effect is wasted. The character may use this card's effect whenever he wishes, but only once.",

Three new cards are then drawn by the GM and made visible (the GM may choose whether or not to explain the cards' effects). The character's ally must choose one of these cards and immediately gains the effects. The character then selects one of the remaining two cards and gains that card's effects. The final card is discarded.",

			"- **The Keep:** The character gains a personal demiplane, as per a permanent create demiplane spell.",
			"- **The Liar:** The character's most powerful, most valuable, or favorite magic item (GM's choice) manifests a curse. Roll on [Table 15-27: Common Item Curses](rule/common_cursed_item_effects) to generate this effect, rerolling results for specific items.",
			"- **The Locksmith:** This card grants the character the ability to open any one door, lock, set of bindings, or other locked barrier. This includes magical gates or portals that have specific requirements to activate. The character may use this card's effect whenever he wishes, but only once. Once used, the card's effect ends.",
			"- **The Lost:** The character cannot gain another level in whichever class he currently has the most levels. This effect can be circumvented if the character is killed and returned to life, but the next time he is restored to life he is affected as if by the spell reincarnate, regardless of what spell was cast.",
			"- **The Marriage:** A comely genie of the character's preferred gender appears and proposes marriage. Should the character accept, he must organize a lavish wedding ceremony by the end of the week and ever after be committed to this exotic outsider. If the character declines or breaks his wedding vow, the genie is heartbroken and returns to his or her home plane, provoking the ire of the associated elemental court. The genie's type, personality, actions, and possible retribution are determined by the GM.",
			"- **The Midwife:** The character gains exactly enough experience to advance to the next level.",
			"- **The Mountain Man:** The character grows one size category, gaining all the benefits and penalties of increased size. His equipment does not increase in size.",
			"- **The Mute Hag:** The character permanently loses one of his senses-sight, hearing, or speech-becoming blind, deaf, or mute (player's choice). This affliction cannot be cured by any effect short of a miracle or wish spell.",
			"- **The Owl:** This card grants the character the one-time ability to scry on any target anywhere for 1 minute. The target, however, is immediately aware that it is being scryed upon by the character. The character may use this card's effect whenever he wishes, but only once. Once used, the card's effect ends.",
			"- **The Paladin:** The character is granted a holy avenger. This weapon has all the properties of a normal holy avenger, along with a special ability that can be used once. Upon being thrust into the ground by its bearer as a standard action, the weapon transforms into a paladin two levels higher than the wielder. This paladin possesses her own holy avenger and aids the character in any way her alignment permits for 30 minutes. Once this time is over, the paladin vanishes and the sword reappears, though it is forever reduced to a +2 cold iron longsword.",
			"- **The Peacock:** The character's skin hardens, becoming rigid and pebbled. He gains a permanent +2 bonus to his natural armor, but takes a -2 penalty to Dexterity.",
			"- **The Publican:** The GM chooses one of the character's enemies. This enemy has a complete change of heart and now favors the character.",
			"- **The Queen Mother:** When the character draws this card, 2d4 giant ants appear to serve the character until they are slain. These creatures eagerly seek to aid and protect the character. They understand the character's verbal commands, though they cannot respond.",
			"- **The Rabbit Prince:** All attacks the character makes that threaten a critical hit are automatically confirmed. Likewise, all attacks made against the character that threaten a critical hit are also automatically confirmed.",
			"- **The Rakshasa:** Anytime the character lies with the true intent to deceive, he turns into a random animal for 1 hour. Lying with the intent to trigger this effect never works.",
			"- **The Sickness:** The character becomes afflicted with incurable leprosy (or another disease of the GM's choice). While the disease cannot be cured by any effect short of a miracle or wish spell, the effects of the affliction can be negated through the use of spells like restoration.",
			"- **The Snakebite:** Anyone who touches the character must succeed at a Fortitude save or be poisoned by greenblood oil. The save DC is equal to 10 + the character's Hit Dice + his Constitution modifier. This poison affects even those who touch the character to administer aid or healing magic.",
			"- **The Survivor:** The next time the character is reduced to -10 hit points, he is instantly restored to full hit points. If he is killed by an effect that slays him without dealing hit point damage (such as by disintegrate), the effect fails to kill him and he is restored to full hit points. If he is killed by a hostile environment (such as a lava flow or when teleporting to a dangerous plane), he is transported to his last safe location and restored to full hit points. This card does not save the character from effects that would permanently disable him, like petrification.",
			"- **The Tangled Briar:** Once per day, the character can communicate as per the spell speak with plants and have a plant truthfully answer any single question. Using this ability upsets the surrounding flora, however, causing 1d4+2 shambling mounds with the advanced template to erupt from the earth and attack the character, regardless of the surrounding terrain.",
			"- **The Teamster:** When the character draws this card, a powerful being appears before the character and tasks him to undertake a dangerous quest. If the character proves resistant to undertaking the task, he is afflicted by geas/quest until the quest is completed. When the character completes the quest, the powerful being reappears, granting the character a lavish reward. The specifics of the quest, the powerful being's identity, and the character's reward are determined by the GM.",
			"- **The Theater:** The next time the character defeats a creature, he is granted a +2 bonus to the same ability score as the creature's highest ability score.",
			"- **The Trumpet:** This card grants the character the ability to summon an outsider of his alignment once per day. This outsider must be of a CR equal to or less than the character's level and serves for a number of rounds equal to the character's level.",
			"- **The Twin:** The character physically becomes a member of the opposite gender.",
			"- **The Tyrant:** The character gains the one-time ability to issue a single command to any creature in the multiverse and have the order obeyed. The target is affected as if by the spell dominate monster, and even orders for the target to kill itself are followed. Any creature targeted by this effect knows that it is acting against its will, and knows the identity and location of the character. Immortal creatures cannot effectively kill themselves, and the act only causes them considerable but fleeting pain. Additionally, creatures with the ability to grant such boons typically also possess the power to revoke them, and do so as soon as the command releases them. The GM ultimately decides what this command can accomplish. The character may use this card's effect whenever he wishes, but may only use it once.",
			"- **The Unicorn:** This card grants the character the one-time ability to undo one past choice or regrettable action. The fabric of reality is unraveled and respun, potentially restoring creatures to life or altering the course of history, depending on how the character acted and how he wishes he would have acted. The player chooses what situation he would have acted differently in and the GM determines how reality changes to reflect that act. The change primarily affects the character, affecting others as little as possible. The character may use this card's effect whenever he wishes, but only once.",
			"- **The Uprising:** Upon drawing this card, 3d6 unruly, accident-prone, 1st-level commoners appear to serve the character. If these followers are killed, the character takes the usual penalties on attracting further followers. Knowledge of these commoners' mistreatment or death spreads far, with the GM determining any repercussions.",
			"- **The Vision:** The character receives two visions and the knowledge that one vision is true and the other false, though he does not know which is which. The GM determines the specifics of these visions. The visions may be views of the past, present, or future; cryptic omens; or total fantasies.",
			"- **The Wanderer:** One of the character's mundane possessions becomes a magical item worth 20,000 gp or less. The GM determines which item manifests magical properties and what those properties are.",
			"- **The Waxworks:** Upon drawing this card, 1d6 exact duplicates of the character appear within a 20-mile radius. These duplicates have the alignment opposite to that of the original character and oppose his goals.",
			"- **The Winged Serpent:** The character is granted a single wish. This wish functions similarly to the spell wish when it comes to affecting rules and statistics, but can also change reality in ways outside the bounds of the spell's effects-such as rerouting a river or ending a war. The GM decides what the wish can and cannot accomplish.",

			"The Harrow Deck of Many Things possesses a strange sort of self-preservation. If the deck is damaged-regardless of how much damage it takes-one card is destroyed and the deck randomly teleports somewhere else on the plane. If it is somehow pursued and damaged again within 1 minute, another card is destroyed and the deck teleports again. If this process is repeated until no cards are remaining, the deck is destroyed.

At 11th level, the mask's enhancement bonus increases to +6, an evil wearer can cast control undead once per day, and a good wearer can cast finger of death once per day.

Her accusations cut too close to the truth, and in a moment of weakness her superiors threatened to excommunicate her. Instead, she said she would enter the Worldwound and fight the Fourth Crusade on her own, with only her magic sword Radiance for company. The church was happy to see Yaniel go, and in the 2 years that followed, she was thought to have been slain. Yet when she returned to Kenabres in 4694 AR, leading a small army of crusaders she'd rescued, both Yaniel and her superiors had changed. For her part, Yaniel had shed her pride and insubordination, and had gained a new appreciation for the difficult decisions leaders are forced to make. And the church leaders had learned that sometimes the truth is exactly what you need to hear. Alas, Yaniel was assassinated before the year was out, slain by the lilitu demon Minagho only a week into her second personal crusade. Her followers managed to return to Kenabres with Radiance, but Yaniel's body had been taken. The sword had gone dark after Yaniel's death, its magical powers apparently lost, and so the crusaders elected to place it in the Gray Garrison on display. Yet several months ago it was stolen by the Templars of the Ivory Labyrinth, who plan to soon send the sword north to Drezen for corruption into a weapon of evil.",

In addition to the damage this weapon deals, any creature struck by the scepter ages a number of years equal to the damage taken. On a critical hit, not only does the scepter deal greater damage, but the victim ages 2 years for every point of damage taken. Creatures aged in this manner [might have their physical ability scores reduced](rule/age). For the wide range of unlisted humanoids and non-humanoids this aging might affect, GMs should use their judgment, general knowledge, and creature descriptions to decide how the effects of aging apply on a race-by-race basis. GMs looking for a quick way to approximate the ages of minor opponents should alter Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution by -1 for every 10 years aged and consider +40 years to be a creature's maximum age. Any creature aged to greater than its maximum age immediately dies. Constructs, outsiders, and undead are immune to the effects of aging. The mental abilities of those affected by this form of aging do not increase. Creatures that gain abilities dependant on their age gain these abilities as normal (though, at the GM's discretion, these abilities might not be immediately usable).

This requires the bearer to make either a DC 30 Knowledge (history) check to program a precise date or a DC 30 Wisdom check to travel to a general period.

Regardless of whether or not this check is successful, a 5-foot-wide glowing tear in time opens within 15 feet. This rift cannot be used as a weapon or to destructive effect. What time the passage opens to is determined by whether the bearer succeeds at the check (opening a portal to the desired time) or fails (opening a portal to the incorrect time, determined by how significantly he failed, as shown on the Accidental Time Travel Results table below).

The sword was handed down through the generations, finally coming into the hands of a well-respected hero of Lastwall: Mandraivus. Serithtial was the perfect weapon for Mandraivus's assault on Scarwall, and some scholars of history now believe that Iomedae had foreseen its need and forged it early to ensure that Mandraivus not only would inherit it, but would respect its traditions all the more.",

Serithtial glows with the equivalent of a [continual flame](spell/continual_flame), but its wielder can extinguish or ignite this glow as a move action. In addition, it gains a further +2 enhancement bonus and deals an extra 2d6 points of damage against foes who serve or worship [Zon-Kuthon](faith/zon-kuthon), as if it had the [bane](magic-enhancement/bane) weapon special ability against such foes. This effect also functions against Queen Ileosa and those who directly serve her-including creatures like the dragon Zarmangarof (who serves her under magical compulsion) and the Red Mantis assassins (who serve as paid mercenaries). While Serithtial was forged as a bastard sword and reverts to this shape when no one wields it, when held in the hand, the sword immediately transforms into the type of blade its owner is most proficient with (choosing from dagger, short sword, longsword, scimitar, falchion, greatsword, rapier, or bastard sword-the GM can add additional sword-like weapons as she sees fit).",

As with all holy weapons, Serithtial imposes 1 negative level on any evil creature attempting to wield it. The negative level remains as long as the creature holds the weapon in its hand and disappears when the weapon is no longer wielded. A worshiper of Zon-Kuthon who wields Serithtial takes 4 negative levels and is nauseated as long as these negative levels persist.

Each of the Sihedron's arms is made of a different skymetal, symbolizing how the nation of Thassilon was made of different races-Azlanti, Varisian, Shoanti, giant, elf, and others. Xin went further than merely making the Sihedron a symbol of harmony and diversity, though, and built into it significant advantages when the artifact is shared among a number of allies.

This transfer occurs so quickly that it can grant the bonus on a saving throw after the saving throw itself has been rolled, but the transfer must be made before the outcome of that roll is announced by the GM. Likewise, the healing granted can occur in the instant before a creature takes damage from any source, possibly healing a heavily wounded target before additional damage renders it unconscious or even kills it.

			"With its shimmering, luminous silver-gray sails and tendency to briefly shift in and out of phase with the Material Plane, this star-faring sailing ship is often mistaken for a ghost ship. Though non-mythic creatures can board the ship as passengers, the Silver Maiden requires a mythic creature to be its captain. If the ship currently has no captain, a mythic character can claim the captaincy by touching the ship's wheel and stating her desire to be captain. The captain then serves until death or voluntarily retirement. Upon assuming the captaincy, the captain becomes aware of all of the ship's powers, and can propel the ship completely unaided from anywhere aboard the vessel, whether sailing the high seas of a terrestrial world or gliding through the vast blackness of deep space.",

Although exact travel times vary, a voyage between two planets within a solar system takes 2d20 days, and a voyage to another star system takes 2d20 weeks (or more at the GM's discretion). The captain must know which world she wishes to travel to (as if the captain cast greater teleport). When the ship arrives at its destination, it slowly descends to the surface (as the feather fall spell), and typically lands in a body of water. Once earthbound, the ship moves as a standard sailing ship. If the planet has no water or comparable liquid, the ship lands on solid ground and is unable to move until the captain once again launches the ship back into space.",

When the ship arrives at its extraplanar destination, it appears in a body of water or comparable liquid, 1 to 100 miles from the captain's intended destination. If the plane has no water (such as the Plane of Earth) the ship appears on solid ground, and is unable to move until the captain transports it to another plane. If the plane has neither water nor a solid surface, such as the Plane of Air, the ship continues to slowly fall (as the feather fall spell) until the captain transports it to another plane.",

It automatically senses the location of any demon in a 5-mile radius, bypassing any spell resistance they possess. Second, it focuses divine energy to power the wardstones, a series of smaller artifacts that together create a physical barrier against demons (see below). Finally, the Demonscope creates a massive dimensional lock effect that extends in a 250-mile radius around clydwell Keep. Although this effect does not prevent demons from entering the Worldwound from the abyss, it does prevent them from teleporting from the Worldwound out into the surrounding lands, and it prevents anyone from teleporting into Mendev. The Demonscope serves a vital role in containing the demons in the Worldwound, and preventing them from overrunning Mendev.",

Each of the Sentinels passed in turn and from their forearms were carved two more shards. Shards were then passed to new protectors dedicated to safeguarding the people and protecting the Demonscope. For years, the shards have been passed down through the order, bestowed upon generations of successors. Each shard is a 6-inch fragment of magically petrified bone, burnished black and polished to a high sheen, and placed within a crystal reliquary. The surface is intricately scrimshawed with sacred blessings dedicated to a specific sentinel. Along the rim of the Demonscope pedestal are three sacred glyphs set before three sockets. Carved in celestial, the three glyphs represent Truth, Valor, and Sacrifice; one for each of the virtues for which the original Holy Sentinels stood: niamar for Truth, Guenarog for Valor, and arymril for Sacrifice.",

			"The Demonscope requires constant attention and maintenance in order to function. Powered by a combination of intrinsic magical power and the magical potency of the demon that is imprisoned within it, the artifact requires that a careful balance of power be maintained at all times, and the demon kept in check. It takes the combined efforts of three strong-willed paladins to maintain control over the demon. If one of them fails, the demon eventually overpowers the other two and begin to corrupt the artifact itself, although this takes several days. The easiest way to destroy the artifact, however, is to remove the bone shards. Without the shards, the paladins are unable to control the demon, and it only takes a few hours for it to break free from its prison."

Additionally, if a paladin wearing the Thorncrown is slain, she may choose to instantly be restored to full hit points for a number of minutes equal to her Charisma modifier.

Those slain by the Thorncrown cannot be brought back to life by clerics with good or lawful components to their alignment-their spells simply fail-though clerics of other alignments can restore a paladin as normal.

The item forged must be at least partially metal, such as a breastplate or spear. Creating such an item requires only half the usual value of raw materials.
