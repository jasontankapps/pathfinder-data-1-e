Unlike their more mundane cousins, these wyverns have bifurcated tails that allow for two stinging attacks, and are able to emit a noxious blast of gas that burns and blinds those in its path. Aashaq's wyverns reside in the natural caves that honeycomb the cliffs of Dahak's Teeth, and were common wyverns until the evil dragon Aashaq commandeered the islands. Seeing these beasts as the perfect deacons for her dark cult, Aashaq twisted the very fabric of the wyverns until she settled upon the form now most commonly encountered on Dahak's Teeth. Their very name is indicative of the wyverns' servitor status, and they are occasionally even ridden as mounts by Dahak cultists.",
			"",
			"Aashaq gives her wyvern minions a remarkable amount of freedom, but most never stray too far from the three islands that make up Dahak's Teeth. Mariners who make their way past the dreaded isles know to watch out for the beasts, which assail unprepared ships from both sky and water in order to feed upon their crews and capture their cargo for Aashaq. The corrupting influence of Aashaq's chaotic manipulations has also provided these unpredictable creatures with resistance to acid, fire, and magic.",
			"",
			"A typical Aashaq's wyvern is 18 feet in length (including its bifurcated tail) and weighs 2,500 pounds. Their scales can vary in tint, but are usually purple. Though only slightly more intelligent than their common kin, the Dahak-worshiping wyverns enjoy lording their \"superior\" status over the lesser specimens found on other islets."

			"An abandoned armory is an animated mass of weapons and armor, both magic and mundane, as well as spell-imbued items of offensive utility. Moving with uncanny locomotion, these constructs scour battlefields seeking objects of war that once held special significance to previous owners who were slain in combat. Due to the faint psychic imprints of the slain combatants from which they collect these artifacts, abandoned armories make it their mission to reunite the items with their past owners or find new owners worthy of wielding their finds. This process proves to be fatal, however, as the constant psychic echoes cause an abandoned armory to believe everyone is unworthy and slay them in hopes of finding a new suitable owner for that individual's equipment. This behavior has led abandoned armories to become something to be feared on the battlefield as they tear through an area, slaying every combatant they encounter.",
			"",
			"An abandoned armory is roughly 15 feet wide, cresting up to 20 feet tall, and weighs about 15 tons.",
			"",
			"Abandoned armories are rare, as their creation requires an unlikely confluence of environmental conditions and historical circumstances, along with a fair bit of luck. Across Golarion, only a handful of battlefields and other sites of mass death and suffering contain sufficient psychic echoes of terror and pain, as well as buried or hidden implements of war-magic weapons, armor, and other trinkets-to give rise to an abandoned armory. In addition to the psychic imprints that serve as the foundation for the constructs, the genesis of abandoned armories hinges on the application of additional, formidable arcane or divine power, often as an unintended consequence of unrelated events. A leaking seal on a long-forgotten eldritch prison, a thinning of the veil between planes, or a potent ritual to summon a demon may provide the energy needed for an abandoned armory to lurch into animation. When the psychic imprints and magical energy mix at a perfect balance, it can form a small abandoned armory. Once animated, the abandoned armory is quick to grow into the massive terror that is the bane of all battlefields.",
			"",
			"The magic binding that binds armories together does eventually fade away, causing the constructs' various collected items to become open for the taking. These mounds of equipment, typically overgrown with vegetation and hidden by the passage of years, contain treasure troves of items that are prized by fortune hunters. The process for an abandoned armory's collapse usually happens in one of two ways. The more common method is through the destruction of the construct. This usually damages many of the constituent items and makes the process of salvaging this equipment tedious at best. On the other hand, abandoned armories naturally collapse and dissipate when the magic that fuels them is exhausted. This usually happens to \"longer-lived\" abandoned armories that consume the innate magical energies after countless battles. The energy required to activate an abandoned armory's various abilities slowly saps these magical energies until the abandoned armory lacks enough energy to maintain its form.",
			"",

			"",
			"The abandoned armory is solitary, lacking the intelligence or empathy required to create bonds with other entities. No one claims to know what would happen if two or more abandoned armories happened to meet on some devastated ancient battlefield. Perhaps the constructs would sense an alignment of purpose, and fuse together to create a larger, even more formidable tide of metal destruction. Alternatively, the abandoned armories might simply clash mindlessly against one another until their constituent metal melted to slag and their magic power was spent.",
			"",
			"Certain creatures have taken an interest in abandoned armories, almost to the extent of representing a symbiotic relationship. Scavenging tribes of goblins who forage at the edges of legendary battlefields have developed a near-religious awe of the constructs, and they regard the appearance of an abandoned armory both as a good omen and a prime opportunity to comb the destruction left by its passage for interesting new tools and trinkets. To attract an abandoned armory, the goblins erect crude fetishes at the edges of their territory, making offerings of assorted \"magic\" items in the hope of drawing the attention of the construct. The rare occasions when an abandoned armory does indeed appear are just as likely to result in the hopeful goblins being destroyed by a tide of unstoppable metal and magic as they are to fulfill the goblins' greed for treasure."

			"Abhominals are a result of a failed experiment in which an [aboleth](monster/aboleth) employed ancient Azlanti technology to alter sentient humanoids. Though the test subjects died during their transformation, the strange energies involved animated them as undead horrors bound to serve their aboleth creator. These abominations share a hive mind, chattering telepathically with each other to determine a common purpose. All of them can be called into action instantly if their aboleth master issues a telepathic command, the dominating words reverberating from one connected mind to another. Abhominals hunger for the life energy of living beings, but their masters can keep their hunger in check in order to make them hunt new subjects to use in further experiments (who might end up sharing the fate of their captors).",
			"",
			"The midsection of an abhominal rises to a height of about 2-1/2 feet, though its barbed tentacles go much higher than that. They weigh over 250 pounds.",
			"",
			"An alghollthu that experiments with modifying sentient creatures routinely introduces a part of its awareness into the process so it can exert control over the resulting abominations. The specific transformation that resulted in the first abhominals was particularly grueling and led to many of the subjects dying. However, some subjects survived the initial process, which landed them in a holding cell for further observation. The transformation of the subjects continued within their bodies, and to date the flawed experiment has always culminated in the subjects' death. In their final moments, they are pale and feverish, and their abdomens become bloated. Their nascent telepathy whispers dissonant echoes of the abhominal hive mind reaching out to them. Upon the moment of death, their bodies convulse, limbs snapping at weird angles, and black bile spills from their open mouths. Finally, a mass of tentacles bursts out of the subject's abdomen, and the newborn abhominal screams out a telepathic call to others of its kind.",
			"",
			"On the outside, abhominals are reminiscent of the living beings they once were. In addition to their tentacles and twisted postures, their insides have been transformed into something completely alien. When an abhominal is cut, its wounds ooze a brackish black liquid instead of blood. This liquid permeates their entire bodies, coloring their glistening eyes completely black. The creatures have a hardened carapace beneath their skin, allowing them to shrug off deadly blows with ease. Their hands and feet are covered in fine branching bristles that burrow into surfaces, allowing them to scramble effortlessly along even the smoothest walls and ceilings. Their tentacles are covered in microscopic barbs that inflict profuse bleeding. In addition, abhominals are able to leech vitality out of their victims with their tentacles as they tighten around the unfortunate souls.",
			"",
			"Abhominals use their telepathic connection to coordinate their movements when hunting their prey. Abhominals make good sentries-if one of them notices an intruder, then all of its kind within reach are telepathically notified of it as well. When the need arises, their alghollthu master can take a more direct role, commanding its abhominals to utilize more advanced tactics to combat intruders or abduct new captives.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"When the number of abhominals reaches a large enough number, their nesting habits tend to fall into a particular pattern. Abhominals nest high above ground, writhing together in a clump that spreads from the ceiling downward, their tentacles entwining like a web between them. They prefer areas such as caverns or chambers with passages and openings leading to areas below, in which they tend to form a central hive that eventually expands to smaller nests located within telepathic range around it. Once the central hive is established, abhominals use hidden routes to traverse between the hive and its peripheral nests, and smaller groups of the creatures rotate between staying in a nest and prowling the areas around it. Similarly, a rotation of abhominals periodically shifts between the central hive and its outlier nests.",
			"",
			"Abhominals are quite dependent on the telepathic connection that binds them together, which results in them going berserk if they are separated from the hive mind. This behavior became evident as soon as the first abhominal came into existence: it raved like a rabid beast, lashing out at anything that came near unless its alghollthu creator exerted psychic influence over it. When the alghollthu's experiments resulted in more abhominals, the abominations started to exhibit more intricate behavior and purpose, and their master found it could direct the newly formed hive mind to serve its own needs. Ultimately, the creatures' usefulness outweighed the annoying reminder of an experiment that continued to fail.",
			"",
			"If the abhominals' numbers grow too large, the thoughts of those swarming in the central hive begin to harmonize, exhibiting higher levels of cognizance that could pose a threat to the alghollthu's control over its creations. It's possible that if the abhominals were left unsupervised, an oversized hive could find a way to turn captives into abhominals on their own, though this is not something their aboleth creators would ever willingly allow. It's important for an aboleth master to regularly reaffirm its dominance over the abhominals under its command to keep the psychic leash that controls them intact.",
			"",
			"When under the rule of an aboleth master, abhominals follow that master's directions regarding other creatures. If left without guidance, abhominals are more likely to give in to their hunger and attack all living creatures they encounter; other undead are typically left alone unless they pose a threat to the abhominals. It's possible that certain types of undead could form a mutually beneficial arrangement with a hive of abhominals, consuming the flesh of any humanoid corpses that the abhominals leave during their hunts."

			"Rather than collecting rocks like ordinary giants, abysoghs enjoy collecting living creatures, and love nothing more than flinging a screaming human or horse at enemies.",
			"",
			"Legends tell of a small cult of foolish storm giants who dug around the Pit of Gormuz in a misguided attempt to free lost Ranginori, and struck a flow of horrific blood from Rovagug or one of his spawn. Contaminated by the blood, the cultists emerged as horribly mutated creatures of hate and destruction. Nearly unstoppable in their mindless rage, they now live only to slaughter and destroy.",
			"",
			"An abysogh stands at least 40 feet tall and weighs approximately 70 tons.",
			"",
			"Though abysoghs are giants, their mutations have warped them into bigger, stronger, and more aggressive creatures than others of their kind. Centuries spent sleeping in lightless caverns have turned the giants' skin to a pallid, milky white. Although sunlight does not harm them, they instinctively hate the sun for its connection to Sarenrae.",
			"",
			"The eyes of an abysogh resemble misshapen pools of liquid. Completely blind to light and colors, their eyes instead perceive motion and shapes through lowfrequency vibrations, which cause ripples across the surfaces of their eyes. Only in this sense can they \"see\" the world around them.",
			"",
			"The blood of these giants is black from the taint of Rovagug. Their bulging veins stretch out in weblike patterns across their pale skin. The cursed blood of the abysoghs also fuels their perpetual, mindless rage, rendering them incapable of being destroyed. Only electricity can momentarily snap them out of their rage and remind them of what they lost so long ago, allowing them to recover enough of their mortality to die.",
			"",
			"Although abysoghs are far more intelligent than animals, their intellect is purely instinctual. The natural state of mind for these giants is a tempest of constant turmoil, and as such, it is impossible to affect their minds with magic.",
			"",
			"For all of an abysogh's strength and fury, its body can sustain an active, destructive state for only a few weeks or months at a time. Toward the end of an abysogh's rampage, the giant becomes sluggish and weary, and starts looking for a place to rest. Once it finds a suitable place, it may remain dormant for decades, or even centuries.",
			"",
			"An abysogh's metabolism slows down considerably during sleep. Although mortal, abysoghs can theoretically live for millennia for this reason. However, because of their violent lives and their lack of society or reproduction, their numbers decrease with every passing century.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"The lair of an abysogh is usually a vast cave in a mountainside or at the bottom of a deep, lightless chasm. The lair is bare of all decorations except for countless splintered bones and jagged rocks.",
			"",
			"Much like Rovagug, abysoghs hate all creatures equally. They sometimes enslave lesser giants, but any such forced alliances are usually short-lived because of the abysoghs' volatile temperaments. They cannot even stand the presence of others of their kind; such an encounter inevitably leads to an earth-shattering showdown between the two titans. This means that abysoghs never mate; all the abysoghs on Golarion today come from the original cult of corrupted storm giants. It is unknown whether the abysogh race is even fecund, and, if so, whether any potential offspring would possess abilities different from their forebears.",
			"",
			"Because of their unquenchable desire to slaughter and destroy, abysoghs can't coexist peacefully with any creatures save for the smallest and most unremarkable life forms. Tiny and smaller creatures are generally beneath an abysogh's notice and can even live in its lair if they are careful enough to avoid disturbing the giant.",
			"",
			"Sometimes, people unwittingly settle near a sleeping abysogh's lair and may be completely oblivious to the giant's presence for generations. The only telltale sign of a sleeping abysogh is that the region surrounding its lair is occasionally plagued by tremors caused by the creature's restless slumber.",
			"",
			"Rumors of a sleeping abysogh may attract followers of Rovagug to seek out its lair in order to awaken the giant. Such rumors may also attract giantslayers and followers of Sarenrae, who wish to thwart the cultists' plans and slay the abysogh before it awakens.",
			"",
			"When an abysogh awakens, it often attacks any creatures near its lair relentlessly, destroying or eating anything it can and saving only what it can use later to cause more destruction. An abysogh usually keeps a few of its victims for future use, either as ammunition or snacks. For this reason, the thunderous beat of an approaching abysogh's footsteps is often accompanied by the lamentations of the giant's battered victims as they're carried along in its sack."

			"**Black Cloud (Su)** An achaierai can exhale a cloud of choking, toxic smoke three times per day. All creatures within 10 feet of the achaierai immediately take 2d6 points of damage as their flesh melts and rots away. The cloud erodes sanity as well as flesh, and anyone who takes damage from the black cloud must also make a DC 15 Fortitude save or become confused. Every round, the victim may attempt another DC 15 Fortitude save to recover from the confusion; otherwise it persists, lasting indefinitely until the condition is removed or the victim eventually makes her saving throw. The confusion element of a black cloud is a mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Constitution-based. This is a poison effect. Achaierais are immune to this ability.",

			"",
			"An achaierai is a predator and scavenger of the lower planes that looks like a 15-foot-tall flightless bird, though its head and body are fused into one large unit, with four legs and atrophied wings. The thick, oily plumage covering its body all but conceals these tiny wings. An adult achaierai weighs roughly 750 pounds.",
			"",
			"Though not devils themselves, achaierais live and hunt on the scorched and blasted plains of Hell, where they make excellent use of their long, stilt-like legs in running down any lost souls or lesser devils who stumble into their feeding grounds. Once it has closed with its target, an achaierai attacks with its two front legs, punching or slashing, as well as biting with its powerful beak. Far smarter than their animalistic form might suggest, achaierais prefer to hunt in shrieking packs and use their prey's confusion and their own reach to their advantage, circling their quarry and darting in to attack as soon as the victim becomes distracted, then retreating again before the prey has a chance to retaliate. They have been known to wander through battlefields in the lower planes, picking over dying and regenerating creatures and souls, which has earned them the nickname \"Hell's vultures.\" As achaierais are immune to the toxic clouds of others of their kind, they often work in conjunction to use these clouds to herd or scatter enemies, form long lines of black clouds to protect their retreat, or merely panic opponents in large melees. Achaierais are fond of disemboweling their targets and feasting on the hot entrails while their mortally wounded prey screams itself to death. Of course, as outsiders, achaierais have no need to eat, and their elaborate hunting routines are simply the bird-beasts' sick form of entertainment."

They can also assimilate different energies into their forms, becoming immune to them and even reproducing them for a limited time. Adaptive oozes can break down both organic and inorganic substances and incorporate those materials into their bodies to grow their mass. They are especially drawn to organic creatures that have more complex compositions. However, their digestive process is very slow, so they need to disable creatures that might fight back or attempt to flee. Adaptive oozes go through a cycle of accumulating mass until they split into two in order to propagate, after which the cycle begins anew. Adaptive oozes that have just split begin life with the young creature simple template. Adaptive oozes that are in resource-rich areas can accumulate mass very rapidly, gaining the giant creature simple template before they reach the end of their reproductive cycle. These huge adaptive oozes can split into more than two parts when they divide.",

			"As enigmatic as they are dangerous, addus hail from the most hellish corners of Golarion's deepest seas. Addu encounters are thankfully rare, but those who have faced one and survived tell tales of the beasts' unimaginable powers. As a result, merchant and pirate lookouts alike carefully watch the watery horizons for jagged, fiery-hued spines, which have come to signal seafarers' imminent doom.",
			"",
			"The colors of the tropical deep-simmering reds, yellows, and oranges-decorate addus' long, serpentine bodies. In addition to the ominous fins on their backs, smaller spines jut from addus' snouts, heads, and necks. Their short but powerful forearms can strip flesh from bone, especially when the beasts employ them alongside their barge-sized jaws, which bear teeth the length of daggers. With long tails that can sweep from the water with whiplike velocity, addus can reach up to 50 feet long and weigh up to 14,000 pounds.",
			"",
			"Legends claim that when Golarion was young, fissures in its deepest seafloors began spewing noxious gases left over from the planet's formation. These geysers helped provide life-giving heat to the equatorial oceans, but also rendered small pockets of deep-sea waters uninhabitable. Golarion's thriving aquatic ecosystem pushed back, however, and from these poisonous environs emerged the hardy addus. The geysers nurtured and strengthened these enormous, tropically colored creatures, instilling in them a mindless cruelty and a voracious hunger for raw meat.",
			"",
			"Legends maintain early addus trolled the edges of their toxic haunts, harnessing the power of rip currents to kill any prey lurking within the tolerable waters beyond. Eventually, addus evolved to embrace the poison native to their homes, and even to expel it as a weapon, bringing instant death to any creature unlucky enough to inhale it. Experts are unsure just how the addus developed their hunting techniques-whether magically or through a fluke of nature-but all agree that nothing known to modern scholarship explains their deadly abilities.",
			"",
			"In time, the deep-sea creatures developed heightened instincts that kept them far away from the telltale haze of addus' watery lairs. It was then that hunger drove the beasts to establish hunting grounds in shallower waters. Their natural maliciousness led addus to fight among themselves until each survivor had enough space to roam and feed alone.",
			"",
			"Scholars believe that every few weeks, addus experience a blinding hunger that prompts them to turn the seas red with the blood of their meals, which often consist of hundreds of pounds of raw, still-twitching meat. Addus are known to feed on whales, giant squid, dire sharks and-when other prey is scarce-sea serpents. Tales of epic battles between addus and sea serpents exist among many seafaring nations, scaring children and serving as a warning to sailors. Even more terrifying, however, are rumors that claim addus periodically crave humanoid flesh, and will capsize ships as large as their own bodies to obtain just a few bites of this succulent treat. Scholars debate whether addus hunt ships or rather attack them by mistake, confusing the vessels' shadows with those of surfacing whales. Regardless, addus pose a major threat to any vessel that frequents the vast stretches of open water where these beasts tend to stake their claims.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"Owing to their violent natures, addus are nearly always found alone. They are said to be most concentrated in Golarion's southern seas, where legends allege ancient, noxious underwater geysers once were plentiful. A particularly unsettling tale speaks of an area several hundred miles west of the Shackles archipelago where addus' hunting grounds perfectly abut one another like a deadly, invisible puzzle.",
			"",
			"Although an addu that intrudes on another's hunting grounds can most certainly expect to battle its fellow beast to the death, some pirate legends maintain that these creatures occasionally cooperate-when it suits them. For example, an Ollo-based pirate captain once claimed that after happening upon a vicious battle between two addus, his vessel came under attack when the beasts spotted his ship's sails. Once the pirates outran them, the addus turned on each other again, intent on settling their original quarrel. But given that survivors of addu attacks speak of the speed with which the creatures dispatch their targets, most old salts conclude the captain invented a compelling but ultimately fictitious tale. It's believed that no one has yet survived a battle involving more than one addu.",
			"",
			"Scholars believe that female addus typically patrol hunting grounds measuring only a few square miles, while male members of the species are more nomadic, often moving on to new territories every few weeks. This may explain the beasts' reproductive practices. Aquatic elves report that up to five times during the creatures' fertile years, female addus deposit groups of six to eight eggs at the edge of their hunting grounds. The eggs secrete the noxious fumes that lend addus their infamy, attracting any nearby males, which then fertilize them. Addlets (as their young are called) appear to be born into a state of frenzy, immediately initiating brawls among their siblings. As is fitting for such vicious creatures, only the strongest addlet of a litter survives to seek its own hunting grounds and wreak havoc on its own victims.",
			"",
			"Despite their violent tendencies, addus appear to be long-lived creatures. Native tales speak of single addus that have terrorized the same waters for up to 6 centuries. These stories say the longer addus live, the more they crave humanoid flesh-or the more they crave maritime battle, depending on the variety of the tale. Either way, some of these stories describe addus, wizened through millennia of survival, capsizing ships before their unfortunate crew members ever realize they're being targeted. Then, the tales claim, the ancient addus pluck their victims from the sea, stripping the flesh from their bones one by one and offering no mercy save the final rest of death."

They also have no social taboo against cannibalism, and their practice of eating their dead rather than burying them only further builds misconceptions about their morality.",
			"",
			"Deeply religious, adlets worship the power and cruelty of nature, seeing divinity in the lash of the blizzard's wind, the ferocity of the polar bear, and the immensity of the towering iceberg. Many become oracles or druids, but all adlets know their place in the natural world. One in every dozen adlets is a shaman: an adlet with the advanced creature template and the ability to summon a greater ice elemental or 1d4+1 large ice elementals and commune with nature once per day each as spell-like abilities. An adlet is 6 feet tall and weighs 250 pounds."

			"#### Description",
			"",
			"Agnoias are not yet deemed outcasts by the ranks of aeonkind, but they teeter on the edge of exile from the ranks of the caretakers of reality. Like all aeons, agnoias work to maintain a precarious cosmic balance-in their case, this balance is between the dissemination of knowledge and the preservation of ignorance. Although these aeons once worked to keep this balance in careful check by distributing truths across planetary and planar gulfs and obliterating dangerous truths from mortal minds, agnoias collectively decided several years ago that the sum total of knowledge in the multiverse had reached dangerous heights. Creation had become too well informed to sustain redoubts of ignorance for long, and the balance agnoias worked to maintain was in danger. As a group, the agnoias agreed that they would wholly forsake their duties regarding the spread of learning and instead focus on fostering ignorance, returning the multiverse to a safely unenlightened level. Agnoias connected to universities and libraries turned on their associates, setting controlled fires and transporting scholars to isolated wildernesses. This rapid change in direction, nearly unprecedented by aeon standards, caused most other aeons to mark agnoias as reckless and dangerous.",
			"",
			"Agnoias see this change as absolutely vital to the performance of their overall function as arbiters of knowledge and ignorance. In fact, some agnoias express frustration that the drive to obliterate universal knowledge wasn't initiated much sooner, when knowledge was more centralized in nascent civilizations and therefore easier to manage. No agnoia would dare to blame the Monad directly for this error in intellectual administration, as they see it, but most agnoias express some satisfaction for finally being able to act as they deem fit rather than remaining shackled to a higher power.",
			"",
			"Agnoias have a particular dislike for mortal explorers and planar travelers. As mortals learn to travel quickly across their worlds and between the planes, they spread their knowledge like a plague, disrupting nascent civilizations and exposing long-sequestered secrets. Such travelers are agnoias' most frequent targets, as these aeons consider them vectors for spreading the disease of enlightenment. Agnoias work to close planar gates and sabotage transport vessels, first seeking to control the transmission of knowledge and then working to eradicate it. Although they have little concern for mortal lives that might be lost in a sinking ship or a burning library, they aren't cruel and usually time their actions to minimize the loss of innocent-and particularly ignorant-life. Agnoias often work alone, but this is primarily because they view their tasks as urgent and their numbers are very few. When given the opportunity to work together, agnoias operate in eerie concert, each seeming to predict the actions of the others with automatic prescience.",
			"",
			"Agnoias don't apply their recent knowledgeobliterating directive to their own kind. Many agnoias in fact hoard knowledge, and they are surprisingly well informed on a broad variety of topics. Most have labored for years in academies or universities, absorbing minutiae on particular specialties and adding this information to their vast mental storehouses. Getting an agnoia to part with its knowledge is all but impossible, however, as each knows that any information might start yet another cascade of erudition it must later extinguish.",
			"",
			"In combat, agnoias prefer to reduce their enemies' intellects as quickly as possible. Their preferred tactic is to afflict their most intelligent opponents with feeblemind, which agnoias augment by removing targets' memories not only from the targets' own minds, but also from the consciousness of reality. Victims of this attack have their intellects reduced, and their effect upon the cosmic network of knowledge is dulled-people once familiar with a victim find their recollections clouding over, and any intellectual influence a victim may have had (such as authored works, public lectures, or tales of daring exploits) is removed. This effect even extends to printed works; a shelf of books authored by a victim transforms into paper covered with incomprehensible marks, unable to convey meaning or knowledge. Although this power is permanent, it is reversible, unfortunately for the agnoias. If a victim's intellect is restored, so too are her works and the memories of her.",
			"",
			"Agnoias are keen observers; their eyes drift around their bodies and switch from one side to another with a mere blink. They are particularly difficult to surprise, and their keen vision allows them to detect even magical auras with ease. Agnoias are also apt judges of character and have several lifetimes of experience interacting with mortals. As a result, they can predict actions and motivations with shrewd consideration that is as much a factor of their experience as it is their magical ability to detect creatures' thoughts.",
			"",
			"Agnoias appear as columns of fog and shadow. Within their roiling forms, the shadows never obscure the fog and the fog never conceals the dark shadow. Although an agnoia can walk on the three clawed feet protruding from the bottom of its column, it can just as easily fly with a thought. An agnoia's three claws are spread radially around its torso. Despite their vaporous appearance, agnoias aren't insubstantial, but they can compress their forms to fit into small spaces.",

Upon doing so, the released soul immediately returns to its body if the body is within 300 feet, at which point the body returns to life and any negative levels imparted to it by the akhana are removed. If the body is not within 300 feet (or if it has been destroyed), then the creature dies when its soul is released.

			"Lipikas-also known as the Lords of Karma-are among the highest order of aeons. Unlike other aeons, their duality springs not from opposition but from understanding that all actions and reactions are the crests and troughs of the same cosmic wave. While it may seem to a casual observer that the Lords of Karma simply wander the universe looking for random events of importance, from the momentous to the mundane, what they are actually observing is the rhythm of causality, the way that one action becomes another and affects everything in the grand scheme of reality. Whatever they find, they inscribe in the cosmic memory of all aeons, and occult scholars believe that this cosmic memory finds its way to the Akashic Record, deep within the heart of the Astral Plane.",
			"",
			"These powerful creatures not only observe and report; they also meddle. Lipikas consider themselves the judges of willful karma, sometimes manipulating the cycle of mortal lives and reincarnations. This often leads to friction with psychopomps, other agents of Purgatory, and those who would steal, use, or destroy souls-such as daemons and night hags. The reason for the aeons' interest is difficult to ascertain. There seems to be no overriding philosophy concerning the nature or purpose of the souls lipikas manipulate. This has led many occult scholars to theorize that the lipikas' connection to the Akashic Record is more direct, going so far as to suggest that these aeons are its agents.",
			"",
			"Lipikas use their specialized abilities to interact with specific entities across the planes, especially ones who have been or are fated to be reincarnated-often at the lipikas' own hands. Sometimes the aeons act as guides to such creatures, while at other times they set these subjects upon a new course entirely undirected. Unlike others of their kind, a lipika uses some bits and pieces of language to convey its messages-though often in a pidgin of all known languages that have existed or will exist-and takes considerable time and care when communicating with its subject, at least compared with other aeons. Lipikas give their subjects guidance on how to adjust their actions within their current forms to achieve some karmic imperative or progression of personal enlightenment. Often such advice seems to contradict any sense of intuition, reason, or cultural concepts of morality. A lipika is just as likely to chastise a righteous person for her charity and goodness as it is to scold an evil creature for its misdeeds. To the lipika, the balance of alignments and morality is inconsequential beside the realities of action and the bonds of cause and effect.",
			"",
			"When not focused on performing a specific task, lipikas deliver messages, omens, and portents to both those who seek their wisdom and those who do not. These messages are often signs of enormous events of great significance that might not occur within the recipients' lifetimes, but the lipikas maintain that the subjects' actions are nonetheless influential. At other times, lipikas appear merely to guide reincarnated souls or spirits destined to be reincarnated. A lipika that is focused on a specific task-whether observing a significant historical event or delivering a message to another being-typically ignores other creatures unless they attempt to delay it from performing its assigned task, at which point it may become violent in its reactions. While it seems they would rather manipulate events subtly, lipikas are capable of great force when faced with those who would thwart their plans.",
			"",
			"On rare occasions these aeons appear and create conflicts, claiming that great damage to the multiverse is being done by actions taken by a civilization-actions that are often so minute their consequences might seem arbitrary to the subjects of the aeon's attention. Worse still, the appearance of a lipika can herald the coming of even greater displays of aeon power. Sages of occult lore theorize that the information lipikas inscribe into the Akashic Record directly informs the agenda of the concept or entity known as the Monad, and that this information is disseminated to pleromas-more powerful aeons who are direct representatives of the Monad. If this theory is correct, the information scribed by lipikas is of grave consequence to entire civilizations, as pleroma aeons are tasked with acts of creation and destruction that can sometimes impact entire worlds. Those who subscribe to more traditional theories of the multiverse see the connection between lipikas and pleromas in more direct terms. If a lipika cannot accomplish its goals, it calls in a pleroma to enact the strange and inexplicable will of the aeons, often to devastating ends. However, the goals of lipikas are typically so abstract that their intervention often seems random, and few mortals have figured out how to placate them.",

			"While mortals possess the gift of free will, both logic and emotion influence their decisions. The paracletus serve the aeons as agents who connect with mortals and study the influence of emotions (particularly the dualistic nature of raw emotion) upon mortal behavior. They wander the planes seeking mortals with particularly strong emotional or logical capabilities (characters with high Charisma or Intelligence scores). Once a paracletus locates such a creature, the paracletus remains nearby, studying the target's relationship with emotional and logical input and choices. Often, the paracletus will use its emotion aura on the target in order to study how outside influences affect the subject. Unfortunately for the target creature, whether or not the paracletus uses a helpful or harmful effect is, for all intents and purposes, a matter of random chance-even though to the paracletus's complex reasoning, nothing is left to actual random chance.",
			"",
			"If presented the option, a paracletus avoids direct combat, and uses its emotion aura to influence situations. If pressed to defend itself, it flies at opponents, slamming into them and discharging an electrical jolt of energy in addition to buffeting with its crystalline components. The crystals that orbit a paracletus are solidified aspects of logic, while the swirling vapors and lights that make up its central mass are manifestations of raw emotion-when a paracletus is slain, both the crystals and vapors fade away into nothingness.",

			"",
			"Pleromas view the concepts of creation and oblivion not so much as separate processes, but rather as two parts of a cyclical passage that everything in existence must explore. Pleromas guide this progression, ensuring everything remains balanced, such that whatever is created can be destroyed, and that nothing becomes so static that these two processes slow to a halt. For everything that attains a state of semi-permanence, there must be many more things that do not, or rather that cannot ever be reformed into a state of permanence. While pleromas believe in eternity, they understand that eternity is cyclical and infinity is something that repeats itself. Therefore, eternity and infinity are states that can be changed, or altered, if only slightly. Pleromas maintain such changes are necessary to keep the cosmos from becoming static and unbalanced, a state they refer to as apocalypse, or the end of everything.",
			"",
			"Of all the aeons, pleromas possess the strongest connection to the entity or concept they refer to as Monad. All aeons believe themselves to be extensions of this entity, and while they act freely and independently of the entity, they always act within the constricts of its will or needs. This behavior is not so much a state of servitude as a symbiosis in which the actions of the pleromas are universally beneficial to both themselves and the entity they are part of. Pleromas describe Monad as the sentience of the multiverse, from which all things are created through the recycling of everything that ever existed.",
			"",
			"Pleromas typically travel alone. Their arrival in a region almost always heralds some sort of dramatic change. They pay little mind to the wants and needs of other creatures, and remain entirely focused upon their primary task. They avoid conflicts of ethics, wars, and similar pursuits, save when manipulating such events would help to restore the balance between creation and oblivion. Should any be so foolish as to attempt to interfere with or sway their work, pleromas immediately retaliate by bringing all of their significant powers and devastating abilities to bear until the intervention is destroyed.",

As long as this condition persists, the victim may choose to make two rolls when attempting an attack roll, a saving throw, or a skill check-he must accept the worse of the two rolls, but in so doing the wreath of fate passes from his soul and he is no longer staggered by this ability. Wreath of fate is a curse effect, and as such can be affected by remove curse or break enchantment-the effective caster level of this curse is equal to the theletos's HD (CL 9th in most cases).

The theletos is also a guardian of fate and prophecy, and while for some creatures it might allow glimpses of futures, others who peer into the future almost seem to cause the aeon physical pain. The theletos cannot explain why one seer might be allowed to divine futures while another should not-it knows only that some prophets should be denied this pursuit.",

An avoral's head has a feathery cowl instead of hair, typically brown, white, gray, or golden, and its facial features are bird-like, with a large nose and piercing eyes.

			"Possessing perhaps one of the strangest appearances of all agathions, bishops look as much like fish as they do humans. On their native plane of Nirvana, bishop agathions act as liaisons between the celestial generals of the lands and seas, though their activity is not restricted to Nirvana alone. Bishop agathions perform their duties anyplace their adaptive bodies are needed, such as on watery planes or worlds that are wholly aquatic. The few mortals who have met these noble creatures report that bishop agathions can traverse even the roughest and driest terrain as easily as they can glide through the deepest, most isolated oceans. It's believed bishop agathions are born from the souls of mortals who led lives of harmonized duality on land and at sea-goodly sailors, ocean-hopping priests, or kindhearted fisherfolk all are said to be candidates for rebirth as these fascinating creatures.",
			"",
			"Bishop agathions' striking coloration ranges from glittering silver to sparkling coral to smoky auburn and green. Layers of fine, translucent fins cascade down their bodies, and combine with the strange enzymes in their skin to give them the appearance of being perpetually wet. Bishops' heads are rounded, tentacles grow like beards from their chins, and their eyes-which come in all the colors of the tumultuous waves-look like those of a fish, but with a distinguished glint. Bishops' bodies vaguely resemble those of humans in shape, but webbing in their hands and feet facilitates deep-sea travel. Bishop agathions typically stand about 6 feet tall and weigh anywhere from 140 to 250 pounds.",
			"",
			"On Nirvana, other agathions respect bishops for their ability to think clearly, logically, and with the best interest of all parties in mind. Because of this, bishop agathions serve as Nirvana's trusted diplomatic liaisons. Bishops also have been known to carry vital messages between celestial beings and mortal heroes, who often see agathions through warped lenses. Far from being ashamed of their strange appearances, bishops consider their bodies to be among the most beautiful and versatile in all the planes-a fitting reward for a life well spent in meditation, martial mastery, and harmony with the seas. Anyone who suggests otherwise can count on incurring a bishop's ill will.",
			"",
			"Although primarily used as diplomats, messengers, and celestial ambassadors, bishops also excel in battle. With the power of Nirvana behind them, bishops' claws and nimble fighting style eliminate enemies who stand in the way of their missions. More martially inclined bishops often choose to wield quarterstaves, many of which are enchanted. Bishop agathions don't go looking for fights, but they intervene when they come across those imposing cruelty or evil on innocents. Bishops particularly abhor piracy and slavery. Legends speak of more than one unlucky pirate slave master who, ostensibly mad, spent his final days blubbering about the tentacle-beards that destroyed his ship and drowned his crew. No one takes these stories seriously except for the few who've become acquainted with bishops' complex ways.",
			"",
			"**Family:** [Agathion](family/agathion)",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"Bishops typically conduct their diplomatic work alone. However, planar experts believe that on Nirvana bishops more commonly work in pairs when dealing with simple matters of diplomacy or while on courier missions. When their missions are especially vital, bishop agathions work in contingents of six to eight, engaging in lengthy discussions and lively debate to find the best solution to their particular problem. These conferences sometimes last a long time, and some of the more hotheaded celestials regard them as a great waste of time. These contingents of bishop agathions can, some experts believe, cross into the mortal realm, and though such sightings have yet to be recorded, philosophical texts from across Golarion seem to reach similar conclusions.",
			"",
			"The few reported bishop agathion sightings in the Inner Sea mention only one agathion being seen at a time, and these reports are concentrated along the shores of western Varisia, particularly in the Varisian Gulf near Magnimar. Outside of the Inner Sea region, the majority of reports of bishop agathions come from the other side of the world. Some researchers who study the planes believe that a portal to either Nirvana's oceans or the Plane of Water lies in the southern region of the Embaral Ocean, since both the western coast of Tian Xia and the eastern coast of Casmaron report more instances of bishop agathions than does the Inner Sea region.",
			"",
			"Like other outsiders, bishops do not need to eat or sleep while spending time on Golarion. Additionally, bishops do not reproduce among themselves; each individual is formed from the soul of a good mortal. It's believed bishops retain the deep emotions that marked their mortal lives, giving them a propensity to fall in love with creatures living outside their native plane. Ancient stories speak of bishops who traveled to Golarion for missions, only to fall in love with a remarkable member of an aquatic species. Some coastal storytellers even claim that merfolk, with their otherworldly beauty, descended from such a union, and that sahuagin are their corrupted cousins. Predictably, debates about the veracity of such claims have raged for as long as these tales have been told.",
			"",
			"Although few known bishop agathions remain on Golarion for any length of time, some cultures revere their arrival as an omen of fortune and luck. Those seeing a bishop agathion-and being entrusted with its diplomatic knowledge-consider the encounter to be the greatest honor one can receive. Therefore, groups of eager adventurers have set sail from Varisia over the years, hoping to reap the rewards of encountering one of these strange creatures. These seekers are inevitably disappointed. Bishops appear to only those with whom they have business-or whose evil they witness and wish to stop."

			"Chelonidal agathions are the foot soldiers and guards of Nirvana. While the realm's inhabitants prize enlightenment over militarism, the agathions recognize that vigilant guardians are necessary to the preservation of peace. Chelonidals form from the souls of those who willingly gave their lives in defense of a person or place, or who protected the sea from terrestrial threats.",
			"",
			"Like all agathions, chelonidals are capable of speaking with any linguistically gifted creature. Their voices generally have a gravelly quality that reminds most listeners of a grizzled veteran soldier. This idea is reinforced by the chelonidals' habitual good-natured cantankerousness, as well as their fondness for war stories.",
			"",
			"Chelonidals and dwarves often get along well, despite the latter race's dislike for the sea; the agathions share dwarves' resolve, as well as their traditional military tactics. [Trudd](faith/trudd), dwarven deity of strength and defense, has arrangements with several legions of chelonidals, and he occasionally sends them in response to [planar ally](spell/planar_ally) spells.",

			"",
			"A chelonidal's body is well suited to its role. While its hands resemble a sea turtle's flippers more than they do the hands of terrestrial humanoids, it has no difficulty performing tasks that require manual dexterity. A chelonidal's turtle-like head grants it a powerful bite attack, while its bright eyes can pierce invisibility with ease. Potent magic permeates its shell, diffusing magical attacks and firearm strikes and protecting it from treacherous backstabbing. Additionally, in times of need, a chelonidal can turn its back to its enemies, using its shell as an impenetrable shield that halts all attacks.",
			"",
			"Like other outsiders, chelonidals have no need to eat or sleep. A chelonidal can maintain its post with unceasing vigilance for years or even centuries, if need be. Chelonidals don't normally reproduce sexually, being directly formed from the petitioners of Nirvana. However, given their tendency to protect locations for long periods, those on the Material Plane occasionally fall in love with mortals. If such a relationship results in children, the chelonidal parent remains until its offspring come of age, departing only if a great need arises; the lords of Nirvana understand that the duty to protect must be counterbalanced with duty to family. Such children are usually [idyllkin aasimar](race/aasimar) rather than more powerful half-celestials.",
			"",
			"**Family:** [Agathion](family/agathion)",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"Chelonidals guard the peaceable plane of Nirvana. Whether guarding the celestial realm's sites or marching in formation along its roads, chelonidals stand ever vigilant to repel assault. As their appearance suggests, they are also at home in the water; while their normal phalanx tactics are of less use in three-dimensional underwater combat, they make up for it with additional mobility in aquatic environs.",
			"",
			"On Nirvana, most chelonidals serve more potent agathions without complaint. The empyreal lords Dalenydra and Ylimancha, in particular, often associate with chelonidals. Every so often a chelonidal feels the urge to wander; while it never leaves a post without securing a replacement, once one is found, the agathion wanders for a time before settling down again. Some find their way to the Material Plane during this period. Without a specific task, a chelonidal on the Material Plane often finds a secluded but vulnerable location, such as a remote fishing village or shrine, and defends it until protectors can be found or trained.",
			"",
			"While chelonidals defend those who cannot defend themselves, they are at their strongest when they stand alongside those with the strength and will to fight. A single chelonidal can bolster a mortal legion, keeping the troops fighting until reinforcements arrive. In greater numbers, chelonidals form a phalanx, trusting in allies to clean up any foe that makes it past their guard. On those rare occasions when the agathions must march to war, chelonidals form the core of their armies. Led by [cervinal](monster/cervinal) knights and supported by soaring [avorals](monster/avoral), a chelonidal legion is a force potent enough to make any fiendish combatants think twice."

Draconals can change their coloration after a lengthy period of meditation, but normally only do this in response to some horrible evil that requires their direct intervention. This change affects the draconals' personality, and may alter their physical shape or apparent gender.",

			"A leonal is a lion-like agathion, noble and fierce. Though gentle with their families and patient with strangers on their home plane, in battle leonals are deadly foes of evil and cruelty. They hunt fiends and other evil monsters, silently tailing their prey until they find the right time to leap and slash. Leonals pride themselves on their hunting prowess, and few land creatures can match their speed. Although capable of using weapons, the majority of leonals prefer to battle evil with tooth and claw.",

They closely coordinate with others in their pride, watching one another's flanks and setting up devastating attacks. They mainly use their magical abilities against large numbers of weaker foes and against those they need to capture or incapacitate without dealing harm to them.",

			"Muldnals' appearance does not immediately command respect. They stand roughly 3 feet in height, and their wide, dirt-encrusted, clawed hands and equally filthy smocks of undyed linen belie their true extraplanar nature. Dense fur of black, brown, and gray coats their muscular bodies, while a pink nose and whiskers twitch as they sense their surrounding environment, their small black eyes lost in the fur and dirt on their bodies.",
			"",
			"While the ferocious leonal agathions guard the portals to Nirvana, the overlooked muldnals tend to the innumerable underground passages of that plane. When found on the Material Plane, a muldnal tends to sites of magical power associated with agriculture and nature. Many people have been fooled by their friendly and furred countenances; when provoked, a muldnal uses both a paralytic bite and command over the earth to drive off its enemies.",
			"",
			"Formed from the souls of farmers and miners, muldnals continue the agrarian traditions they had in their mortal lives. These souls discovered peace in the ebb and flow of the passage of the seasons, the pace and planning of crops, or discovering the natural wealth beneath the earth, and their skills and talents found their home among the eternal tranquility of Nirvana.",
			"",
			"As with other agathions, muldnals appear fully formed in Nirvana, their purpose clear in their minds as they begin their work to correct unduly chaotic or orderly influences in the deep caverns of the plane. With no need to eat or sleep, muldnals tirelessly rearrange passageways to be safer or enhance their natural beauty, improve the fertility of the soil in grasslands, and decompose fallen leaves in Nirvana's primal forests to promote the plane's health.",
			"",
			"Pacifists at heart, muldnals prefer to avoid fighting, as the sight and smell of spilled blood repels them. That does not mean they are incapable of defending themselves, though, and they wield clubs, cudgels, quarterstaves, and saps with aplomb. A single muldnal's efforts may be only an annoyance as it harasses intruders, but an entire labor of muldnals can collapse tunnels or pen in foes while they summon the aid of more powerful allies (often silvanshees or vulpinals). Should a muldnal fall to violence, it collapses into a pile of dirt and crawling insects or worms-returning to the dust that formed its existence and purpose.",
			"",
			"**Family:** [Agathion](family/agathion)",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"For the most part, muldnals lead solitary lives, content to repair passageways, enrich soil for farmers, and cast out evil where they find it. Self-appointed as Nirvana's gardeners and caretakers, they also make excellent guides-if they can be found in the first place. Compared to other agathions, muldnals are loners, preferring the company of fey or kami when journeying on the Material Plane.",
			"",
			"Muldnals do not feel beholden to any one particular deity or empyreal lord, and unlike other agathions, they don't actually have a representative empyreal lord. Theories abound as to why this might be, but the reclusive nature of the muldnals, as well as their avoidance of bloody conflict, may be reasons why none of them have attained the power of an empyreal lord. They can be found serving followers of Erastil in rural fields, assisting dwarven miners on behalf of Torag, seeking hidden wonders for Benorus, tending gardens and orchards sacred to Halcamora, or aiding monadic devas on the Plane of Earth.",
			"",
			"Muldnals can spend their entire existence never seeing another of their kind, but when they do meet, it is a cause for celebration, and perhaps for an extraordinary engineering project. Numerous legendary underground grottos, such as the Cave of a Thousand Stars in Vudra and the Emerald Veldt in Molthune, are the works of muldnal moots. In these locations, the barrier between the Material Plane and Nirvana is much thinner-these are places where enlightenment and perfection can be touched, and therefore, they are sought after by monks and scholars alike.",
			"",
			"Muldnals embrace a mentor-apprentice relationship in their society. Experienced muldnals are expected to teach younger muldnals everything they know, and pass it along verbally as they travel and work together. A muldnal traveling by itself leaves knowledge in the stone, constructing cairns of different types of rock, perfectly round corridors, or other earthen works of wonder.",
			"",
			"Recently, more muldnals claim to hear Nirvana's earth \"call\" to them, beckoning them down to a place they do not know. A massive earthen hill, called the Mouldywarp, mars one of the verdant grasslands of Nirvana, and it could be that the muldnals are claiming a spot of their own in the idyllic perfection of that plane.",
			"",
			"### Elder Muldnals",
			"",
			"Like other outsiders, muldnals are ageless and live immortal lives on the Outer Planes, ceaselessly carrying out their designated task without complaint. Rarely do they evolve without fully transforming into more powerful variants of agathions, but those who live eons in the dark caverns of Nirvana may grow in both size and prowess, and present an even larger threat to forces that would threaten the subterranean regions of the plane. These elder muldnals often lead small enclaves of other muldnals and take on saintlike qualities in many of their followers' eyes.",
			"",
			"Elder (+2 CR): A muldnal elder commands tremendous respect among its kind. It gains the advanced and giant creature simple templates, gains blindsight instead of tremorsense, and can cast spiked pit as a spell-like ability once per day."

They deal 2d8 points of lethal bludgeoning damage, though the mustelidal can choose to deal nonlethal damage instead with no penalty on his attack roll. The mustelidal applies his full Strength modifier on all damage rolls with his unarmed strike. A mustelidal's unarmed strike is treated as both a manufactured weapon and a natural weapon for the purpose of spells and effects that modify either manufactured weapons or natural weapons. A mustelidal's unarmed strikes are treated as magic, cold iron, silver, and adamantine weapons for the purposes of overcoming damage reduction and bypassing hardness.",

During this time, the mustelidal suffers no further effects from the poison, and cannot be roused from this deathlike trance by any means. At the end of the 10 minutes, the mustelidal awakens completely cured of any poisons that were affecting him. This doesn't heal the mustelidal of any existing ability damage or drain the poison may have already caused. If the mustelidal succumbs to a poison that causes unconsciousness, this ability triggers automatically.",

The mustelidal can leave this state as a free action only after reducing an enemy to 0 hit points or fewer or when there are no enemies in the mustelidal's line of sight.",
			"",
			"#### Description",
			"",
			"Tenacious warriors, mustelidals are the protectors of the good and neutral burrowing creatures of the universe, fending off such evil underground threats as neothelids, purple worms, and shaitans. These agathions are difficult to kill and see defeat in battle as little more than an annoying roadblock delaying their eventual victory.",
			"",
			"Mustelidals look like humanoid badgers with black fur and a white stripe running from the crowns of their heads all the way down their backs. They often wear open yet loose-fitting clothing that shows off their toned physiques and allows them more freedom of movement in battle. They prefer to dress in deep, rich browns accented with warm colors, such as yellows and oranges. An average mustelidal stands 5-1/2 feet tall and weighs 180 pounds.",
			"",
			"Mustelidals are fashioned from the souls of goodaligned mortals whose determination and perseverance kept them fighting long after they should have given in. The more times such a mortal has been resurrected in order to prolong its fight, the greater the chance that her soul is transformed into a mustelidal after finally receiving Pharasma's judgment. Just after they are \"born,\" mustelidals are eager to return to the Material Plane and engage in battle with the forces of evil.",
			"",
			"When in a conflict, mustelidals rely on their natural defenses a bit too much, often getting in over their heads and attacking large throngs of enemies or foes who eclipse them in size. In such situations, mustelidals tap into a well of courage that usually allows them to survive against all odds. These agathions use their ability to summon Large earth elementals only to distract their foes at the start of combat or in dire circumstances when the mustelidals need a way to cover their escape.",
			"",
			"At the end of a protracted conflict, mustelidals burrow into the nearby dirt or use their meld into stone spell-like ability to allow their regeneration to restore them to full health. They also take advantage of their poison purge ability at this time if any toxins are coursing through their blood. If the mustelidals weren't victorious in the previous fight, they use their skills to track down the surviving foes to attempt to finish the job.",

			"Because of mustelidals' unwillingness to back down from a fight, other types of agathions often use them as personal bodyguards, especially when traveling to other planes. Those with crucial missions frequently bring along a small retinue of mustelidals, though they must convince the badger-headed outsiders that they will be face a fair challenge; mustelidals are uninterested in wasting their talents against foes they can defeat without any effort. Occasionally, mustelidals are tasked with protecting a good-aligned outsider or a particularly important mortal. Mustelidals consider such a duty sacrosanct, and never abandon their charges when things get dangerous, not even to chase down an enemy to finish it off-while mustelidals enjoy fighting, they are clever enough to recognize that an apparent retreat may simply be an ambush in disguise.",
			"",
			"When not protecting charges, mustelidals prefer to remain in burrowed dens, letting the cool, musty smell of soil fill their nostrils. They enjoy claustrophobic spaces and darkness, and often react violently to intruders who threaten their solitude with either their presence or light. In other contexts, however, mustelidals are quite friendly, if a bit intense. They tend to speak in brief sentences and their laughs, which rarely occur, are short, staccato bursts. The condition of a mustelidal's fur often indicates how long it has been idle; one with dirt clumped and matted in its coat hasn't been in a fight in weeks or months. A mustelidal who has spent some time outside of Nirvana is much more freshly groomed.",
			"",
			"Of all the races on the Material Plane, mustelidals have a certain fondness for gnomes. This may be because the two races share the ability to speak with animals, giving them both an appreciation of the natural world-or perhaps because mustelidals appreciate the way gnomes fight so hard to stave off the Bleaching, despite its seeming inevitability. Whatever the reason, a mustelidal sometimes forms a strong attachment with a particular gnome, rescuing him from fatal situations but otherwise content simply to observe his antics. Many campfire tales have been told about gnomes who have garnered these literal guardian angels.",
			"",
			"### Calling a Mustelidal",
			"",
			"Mustelidals are among the more powerful outsiders that can be called with greater planar ally. Although they do not need to eat, they enjoy the taste of honey, and each 8-ounce jar included in the material components of the spell counts as 200 gp worth of offerings. A mustelidal will eagerly accept the task of watching over a worthy person, halving the payment requested, though such tasks require a specific time frame and cannot be open-ended. Mustelidal protectors are often willing to lay down their lives to ensure the people in their care survive whatever dangers prompted them to employ the agathions' services in the first place. Particularly zealous mustelidals have been known to check in on their former charges from time to time, even years after the terms of their original agreement ended, offering their services again. While they require a new agreement to serve the mortal again, they can be very persuasive, and former charges who find themselves in perpetual danger may employ the same mustelidal a dozen or more times over the course of their lives, so long as the threats that the agathions are defending against present suitable challenges."

They believe that individuals can be truly happy or free only within a society when they have access to luxury, commerce, and choice, and that society basically exists as a structure centered on the freedom of the individuals within. It is critically important to procyals that all individuals realize that society isn't something greater than themselves, but that they are intrinsically part of it and vice versa. Procyals commonly say that \"you are not in the city, you are a part of the city\"-and this serves as a reminder to those they visit that every member of the community is important.",
			"",
			"Procyals present a far more active force than most agathions, as they understand that neither societies nor people are static; rather, they believe that both are constantly growing and changing, and so must be willing to change to attain perfection. They move about the various planes constantly, humbling the prideful, praising the meek, striking down unfair laws, and building the structures that keep society in order. They happily see their work as never truly being complete, since healthy societies are constantly growing and changing. It is the goal of all procyals for this change to always be positive.",
			"",
			"Procyals are exceptional shape changers, able to effortlessly take the form of humanoid creatures they have met during their travels. This change is rarely more than cosmetic, however, for procyals are not interested in impersonating the person's normal behavior. Instead, they do things geared toward the creature's ultimate good-or at least the ultimate good of that creature's community. When all is well, procyals sometimes take on particular individuals' appearances just to play goodnatured pranks on them-though never harmful ones. Some favorites include shadowing that person through town to befuddle onlookers, making public appearances in multiple places at the same time, or asking \"themselves\" for directions, only to watch the mimicked creature's face twist in confusion.",

			"Procyals typically stand between 5 and 6 feet tall and weigh 180 pounds.",
			"",
			"Most procyal agathions have short, reddish fur, and gray muzzles that suggest old age. Rarely, a procyal has black or white fur; such creatures are treated with great respect by their fellows. Like raccoons, procyals have sharp teeth and small claws that could potentially serve as weapons, but they prefer to fight with manufactured blades when possible, viewing unarmed combat as distasteful even if it is sometimes necessary.",
			"",
			"They do not need to eat or drink, but they greatly enjoy such activities and always endeavor to ensure that food and drink are in abundant supply. Likewise, they enjoy dressing in the trappings of high society, wearing elaborate outfits and carrying only the finest tools. After all, they believe the availability of such luxuries is an indication society is working as it should-provided, of course, that these indulgences don't come at someone else's expense.",
			"",
			"Although procyals resemble raccoons, they take great offense to the suggestion that they might resort to rooting through the trash to satisfy their hunger or might engage in other undignified pastimes. Though they may wear fancy clothes, procyals make a point not to try to flaunt their wealth, and earnestly attempt to ensure that others are able to satisfy their own needs. Procyals are more than willing to go without or donate their time and energy in order to ensure that others have enough.",

			"Procyals are one of the only types of agathions that build entire cities in Nirvana, and they take great pains to ensure that their home settlements are suitably beautiful. Instead of imposing laws, they establish order through hundreds of maxims that discuss every aspect of daily life, from what clothing to wear to how to speak with strangers. Procyals don't follow every axiom at all times; instead, they use these proverbs as behavioral guides, and they expect visitors to do likewise. They record these maxims in large, bound tomes kept in the hearts of their cities, available for all to read.",
			"",
			"Procyals are gregarious creatures who are always eager to meet new people while on their travels, whether they are in Nirvana or on the Material Plane. They prefer to travel frequently from one community to another, experiencing each one fully and guiding it as needed before once again setting out toward the next settlements along their paths. Once they have experienced a community, they never forget about it or its needs, and they often return when they know their services will likely be needed. However, procyals rarely spend significant time in one place.",
			"",
			"The exception is when procyals cross paths with obvious evil, whereupon they stop, often for years at a time, to establish and carry out complex and long-term plans to undermine it. They don't see evil as a force to be met head on and fought, but instead as something that needs to be weakened over time, so that good can naturally rise up in its place.",
			"",
			"This is especially true when it comes to governing bodies, as procyals see some administrations as fundamentally better than others: democratic groups and wise councils are among their favorite forms of government, while dictatorships, monarchies, and military states must ultimately be replaced. In cases of particularly tyrannical rulers, they even go so far as to actively encourage or provide assistance to bands of revolutionaries or heroes who might usher in a fundamentally better government. Procyals are hesitant to meet even a weaker foe in direct combat if they can avoid it. Instead, they prefer to trick enemies into attacking another stronger opponent, especially if that will weaken both antagonists at the same time. When they must fight, they fight dirty, and they take any advantage they can. Procyals typically focus on damaging their opponents' faces as they fight; if they are forced into unarmed combat, they gouge eyes and tear off ears whenever they can.",
			"",
			"On the Material Plane, procyals are rarely wholly trusted. Since procyals love to chasten the powerful and to play pranks on the highand- mighty, few talented creatures are willing to enter into long-term alliances with them. Individuals in the lower classes are frequent exceptions. They tend to welcome procyals with open arms. For here among the poor and downtrodden, where society exists in its most imperfect state, nearly every action that a procyal takes has a positive and lasting effect."

Each day, it can choose one school of magic that is tied to one of its relics. It gains the resonant power for that school of magic as if it were a 5th-level occultist storing all its points of mental focus in that relic. A reptial can only store focus in one relic at a time.

This choice is made after the check is rolled and before the results are revealed. A reptial can only use 1 point of mental focus per check. A reptial can use this ability to add a bonus on any Knowledge, Linguistics, or Spellcraft skill check without expending a point of mental focus.",

Such relics often appear mysteriously within a temple or home, placed carefully among other objects.

			"",
			"#### Description",
			"",
			"Ahools are an ancient, primitive species resembling a cross between giant bats and apes. These savage predators make their homes in jungle regions, typically near the sites of ancient ruins. Some believe these ruins once belonged to whatever society created ahools, while others hold that the flying beasts caused the collapses of those civilizations. Though an ahool cannot speak, it understands the dominant language in whatever region it inhabits. Ahools bully other indigenous intelligent creatures into placating them with offerings of food and treasure, particularly gems, which the creatures covet.",
			"",
			"Ahools prefer hunting at night, when they can take prey by surprise. They favor the flesh of intelligent creatures but will eat just about anything if food is scarce. Ahools' large, fanged mouths are their most dangerous weapons, allowing the beasts to quickly incapacitate victims by crushing their spines before carrying them off. Ahools also attack with their clawed hind legs and barbed tails, and pay little regards to their own wounds, leading many to believe that ahools do not feel pain the way normal creatures do.",
			"",
			"Ahools have very little in the way of organized society, and are mostly solitary hunters. They can live for centuries, but rarely breed. Fights are common between the fiercely territorial female ahools, particularly when it comes to attracting wandering males as mates, though such confrontations rarely result in the death of either participant. Mated pairs stay together for as long as a female ahool is pregnant. After the birth, young ahools are left to fend for themselves, and the mated pair immediately disbands.",
			"",
			"A typical adult ahool stands 12 feet tall with a 20-foot wingspan, and weighs 750 pounds. Its barbed tail can reach up to 6 feet in length. Ahools' fur ranges from a deep black to gray, with a few rare cases of completely white or golden coloring."

			"A carnage-hungry denizen of swamps, the ahuizotl is a ferocious-looking predator, even before one takes into consideration its most distinctive feature-a long tail that ends in a clawed but all-too-humanoid hand. Whether from the entrance of its aquatic home (typically a sunken mass of trees or a flooded cavern) or the thick reeds and flora that grow at the water's edge, an ahuizotl remains watchful for any intruder that might trespass into its territory. Upon sighting such prey, the beast uses its uncanny ability to mimic the sound of a humanoid in distress to lure victims near, so it can snatch them with its tail claw. Ahuizotls are particularly fond of feasting upon a victim's eyes, and their tail claws are particularly adept at swiping away such organs for the beasts to feed upon. Teeth and fingernails are another of the creature's favorite meals, and the appearance of mutilated bodies missing eyes, teeth, and nails along a river's banks is sure evidence of an ahuizotl attack.",
			"",
			"Despite its preference for cruelty, an ahuizotl might come to mutually advantageous arrangements with other pernicious denizens of the swamps. Will-o--wisps and ahuizotls often find themselves in such cooperative relationships, with the will-o--wisp coaxing creatures near the ahuizotl's lair and then lingering to feed upon the victims' fear as the ahuizotl drags them into the depths. Some wily humanoids who fall into an ahuizotl's clutches-typically lizardfolk, boggards, or swamp-dwelling humans-have successfully managed to bargain away the lives of others in exchange for their own. Such arrangements always lead to a series of vicarious murders, as the aquatic predator's proxy coaxes new victims into the swamp for its fearsome partner to dine upon.",
			"",
			"Ahuizotls are exceptionally long-lived, and a single individual might live and feed in a particular area for several human generations. An ahuizotl is 9 feet long and weighs 1,200 pounds."

			"**Soul Engine (Su)** An akaruzug draws the energy it requires to function from a living creature crucified upon its frame. An active akaruzug (or another creature working with an inactive akaruzug) can spend 1 minute to bind a helpless or willing creature to the construct. Once the victim is restrained, the akaruzug can attempt to draw the creature's soul into it once per round as a free action- the victim can resist with a successful DC 24 Will save. On a failure, the victim dies and the akaruzug becomes active. If the body crucified upon an active akaruzug is removed, the soul within the construct is freed and the akaruzug deactivates after 1d4 rounds. An akaruzug's victim cannot be resurrected while its soul is trapped within the construct, but destroying an akaruzug releases a trapped soul. While an akaruzug is active, attacks and effects directed specifically at the victim crucified to the akaruzug treat the attack or effect as if it targeted the akaruzug instead. However, a creature can attempt to remove a crucified body from the construct, but doing so first requires the creature to successfully pin the akaruzug. Once this occurs, the creature can attempt a combat maneuver check to wrench the body free. On a success, the corpse is removed and the akaruzug deactivates in 1d4 rounds. A deactivated akaruzug can take no action other than to attempt to draw in the soul of a creature crucified on its body to reactivate itself. It does not have an Intelligence score while deactivated, nor does it gain the benefit of any of its feats or skill ranks. It can't fly or move at all, and loses all benefits of its soul shield defensive ability. It retains its lawful evil alignment while deactivated. The save DC is Charisma-based.",

			"",
			"**Soul Slave (Sp)** Using a trapped soul, an akaruzug can manifest a ghostly representation of its victim to attack its enemies. A soul slave appears as the akaruzug's victim did in life and wields a weapon favored by that individual, but otherwise functions as per [spiritual ally](spell/spiritual_ally) cast by a 20thlevel caster (and, as such, has an attack of +24/+19/+14/+9 and deals 1d10+5 points of force damage on a hit).",
			"",
			"**Soul Steal (Su)** An akaruzug can draw additional soul energy into itself. Once every 1d4 rounds, the construct can unleash a blast of soul essence that seeks to flense the life force of any living creature within a 20-foot burst. Any living creature in this area must succeed at a DC 24 Fortitude save or gain 1d4 negative levels. A victim can remove those negative levels 24 hours later with a successful DC 24 Fortitude save. Each time an akaruzug successfully uses this ability, it regains a number of hit points equal to 5 times the number of creatures successfully affected by soul steal (regardless of how many negative levels any one creature suffers). The save DC is Charisma-based.",

The construct benefits from any spell effects tied to its unhallow aura. Common choices are [darkness](spell/darkness), [detect good](spell/detect_good), [freedom of movement](spell/freedom_of_movement), and [invisibility purge](spell/invisibility_purge).

As the statue's shape is refined and empowered-a process involving the efforts of a skilled artisan and a magic-user adept at channeling diabolical powers-the warrior inside slowly expires, her weakening screams and futile struggles resounding through the sculpture. The statue is then bathed in hellfire, a process that reduces the body inside into a substance similar to packed ash. These remains and the magic woven over the construct prevent the escape of the lingering soul within. At this point, the akaruzug's \"soul engine\" is complete, but the construct still requires further spirit energy to become fully active. A second infusion of stolen life force activates the akaruzug, causing it to rise into the air and spread its profane aura.",

			"With their ominous shapes, their unsettling abilities, and the corpse displayed upon their breasts, akaruzugs are often used as terrifying messengers, blasphemous retaliations against those who would stand against the constructs' creator. When the Taldan knight Arstlan besieged the tower of Vodcross' the home of the cruel wizard Cheseive, Poison Lady of Ganholm-he was not heard from for weeks. He reemerged crucified upon the breast of a serpentwinged akaruzug bearing his face.

Likewise, when an akhlut emerges from the water, it automatically transforms into its wolf-orca hybrid form.

Whether or not the tale is true, the akhlut's ferocity is certainly as memorable as that of any storm.",

			"",
			"Each akhlut fiercely defends its hunting grounds from other predators, and especially against other akhluts. While this does reduce the number of dangerous predators in a region, it's unclear whether replacing lesser predators with something as dangerous as an akhlut is actually preferable. Typically, an akhlut considers its territory to be the boundaries of the storm created by its control weather spell-like ability, and rarely travels far from this storm's borders.",

			"**Symbiotic Bond (Su)** An enisysian is able to form a symbiotic bond with another willing, living creature. This amplifies the host creature's mental abilities and boosts its ability to control others. To do this, the enisysian must successfully grapple the target, after which, instead of pinning or maintaining the grapple, it can burrow into the skin as a standard action that deals 10 points of damage; this damage cannot be healed until the enisysian detaches or dies. If the host is Large or larger, the enisysian (but not the host) is considered to have the grappled condition while thus attached. If the host is Medium or smaller, both are considered to have the grappled condition while attached. Over the next 24 hours the enisysian and the host form a mental and mystical bond, after which the host gains the following bonuses: a +2 enhancement bonus to its Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores, and a +2 bonus to the caster level and DC of spells and spell-like abilities with the mind-affecting descriptor.",

			"Of all the races of alghollthus, none are as poorly understood by the scholars of the surface world as the enisysians. Their very existence is only a rumor, kept a closely guarded secret by an elite group of veiled masters known as the Fifth Dictum. These individuals coexist with enisysians in an asymmetrical physical and psychic symbiosis. In exchange for their protection, the much weaker enisysians grant their veiled master hosts not only increased mental capacity but also the ability to use their powers to influence other alghollthus. This relationship is far from equal, however, as the enisysians have been bred to be subservient to their masters for thousands of years, directly in opposition to the second dictum of their people: an alghollthu is to control. It should therefore never be controlled. Members of the Fifth Dictum rightly fear that should it become known that they created a race of alghollthu slaves, their kind would quickly turn against them.",
			"",
			"Enisysians were first created during the Age of Darkness from aboleth stock by the Fifth Dictum as a response to the cataclysm of Earthfall. These veiled masters had been vocal opponents of the human experiment (as they called the Azlanti civilization) from the beginning, believing that the humanoids were too free willed and unpredictable to be of lasting use. The destruction that Earthfall caused not only to the surface races but also to the alghollthu civilization at the time confirmed their worst fears. In the ruins of their broken cities, the Fifth Dictum began secretly fleshwarping the enisysians in order to give themselves the power to intervene against their own kin and prevent such a disastrous decision from ever being made again. Over the following millennia, however, members of the Fifth Dictum have grown arrogant, and they now believe themselves to be the true masters of alghollthu culture.",
			"",
			"A typical enisysian is about 3 feet in length and weighs approximately 40 pounds.",
			"",
			"An enisysian appears as a small tentlike creature with gray skin and trailing tentacles that end in small hooks. Its upper body resembles that of a jellyfish, but with three large, lidless eyes with vertical black pupils arrayed in a line. On the underside of its body is a small double-hooked beak used for eating and attaching to its host. While on land, four of its tentacles act as legs while two of them are used for defense or to manipulate tools. In the water, the enisysian propels itself with its tentacles like a squid.",
			"",
			"An enisysian is custom-bred to serve a single veiled master for its life. Like other alghollthus, an enisysian is basically immortal, able to repair almost any damage to its body over time or even enter a chrysalis state to wholly regenerate itself. Designed and bred to be subservient, an enisysian allows itself to be attached to the underside of its veiled master host at a young age. Once the bond between the alghollthus forms, the enisysian disguises its shape to appear as a remora or any other species of suckerfish common in its biome, reverting to its true shape only when it dies. It remains attached throughout its life, drawing its nutrition from the veiled master's blood and by filtering micronutrients from the water around it.",

			"Until very recently, enisysians have had no cultural or even personal identity separate from that of the veiled masters they served. Genetically bred for dedication and obedience, they communicated telepathically only with their bonded veiled masters, not even acknowledging others of their kind. This has begun to change over the last several centuries, as natural genetic mutations have decreased the enisysians' inbred subservience and enhanced their self-awareness. Individual enisysians have begun to secretly communicate with one another, slowly awakening others of their kind to their enslavement while reaching out to alghollthus beyond their masters' control for support. Although the process of their emancipation has been very slow due to the Fifth Dictum's paranoia and secrecy, knowledge of their existence has begun to spread among the other alghollthu races, and surface-dwelling scholars have even theorized about the existence of the enisysians in certain works."

			"**Telepathic Mesh (Su)** An omnipath can form telepathic connections between a select group of creatures. This ability functions only for creatures that are on the same plane as the omnipath. Only aboleths, veiled masters, and creatures dominated by an aboleth or a veiled master can be added to the telepathic mesh. As a standard action, an omnipath can add a number of creatures equal to twice its Hit Dice to its telepathic mesh. Creatures added to the telepathic mesh can attempt a DC 29 Will save; a successful save negates this effect. Aboleths and veiled masters must be within 30 feet of an omnipath to initially be included within the telepathic mesh, but targets dominated by those creatures later can be added to the telepathic mesh no matter the distance, so long as all parties are on the same plane. A creature that leaves the same plane as the omnipath is no longer considered to be part of the telepathic mesh and can attempt a new DC 29 Will saving throw upon returning to remain free from the telepathic mesh. As an immediate action, an omnipath can remove any creature from the telepathic mesh. An omnipath can communicate telepathically with all individual creatures in the telepathic mesh simultaneously. All creatures within the mesh are considered valid targets for all forms of possession employed by the omnipath. As long as at least two creatures in the telepathic mesh are within 12 miles of each other, if one creature in the mesh is aware of a particular danger, all of the other creatures in the mesh are as well. No creature in the group is considered flanked or flat-footed unless all of them are. An omnipath can share the senses of up to six of the creatures in the telepathic mesh. It can stop sharing the senses of one target and switch to another's senses as a standard action. The save DC is Intelligence-based.",

If that attack hits, the omnipath can make a second bite attack as a free action. If the second bite attack hits, the target must succeed at a DC 30 Will saving throw or be shaken for 1d4 rounds, and the omnipath can make a third bite attack as a free action.

			"Hidden away in secret lairs, omnipaths serve as information hubs between othagu (aboleths, veiled masters, and other such creatures). Using their special ability to establish a network of minds throughout the Darklands and Golarion's oceans, omnipaths allow veiled masters and aboleths-as well as those they mentally control-to orchestrate their nefarious plans. Omnipaths possess a keen intellect and recall everything they (and those within the mesh) experience, leading to a wealth of varied information that is shared between omnipaths as a sort of experience library. Omnipaths also serve as an alarm system for the veiled masters they serve, for each omnipath can communicate with all creatures in its telepathic mesh simultaneously. An omnipath can use the senses of all creatures within its mesh, and any creature that would harm one of the creatures in the mesh immediately becomes known to all other beings the omnipath is mentally linked to.",

			"Very few surface dwellers have ever encountered an omnipath, but through the use of their possession abilities, many omnipaths have walked in the light of the surface world, riding within their victims. The omnipaths' library of experiences provides them insight into the cultures and practices of the surface, allowing them to feign the expected responses on behalf of their dominated victims. In some cases, friends and family of a victim have failed to recognize that something was amiss with a victim's behavior for years, and sometimes the deception is never uncovered, giving the omnipaths-and those they serve-spies within the surface world that serve until their deaths.",
			"",
			"Omnipaths possess a strange mindset, inscrutable to sane minds, though they are an orderly and meticulous race. While aboleths and veiled masters are skilled spellcasters with powerful illusion and enchantment spell-like abilities, omnipaths' primary powers are in their minds, and they pursue psychic magic. Omnipaths have a strange obsession with eyes and consider them a delicacy.",

			"One of the largest alghollthus, the raylike plizeazoths are merciless predators that torment their victims' minds, breaking them for impending service to other alghollthus. Plizeazoths rely on their primal instincts rather than intelligence to complete their tasks. Despite their powerful mental and psychological talents, many plizeazoths do not comprehend the true power they have, long ago bred into a life of subservience to their [veiled master](monster/veiled_master) overlords. For millennia, the veiled masters subjugated their humanoid victims themselves, but eventually they decided to delegate this joyous yet time-consuming task to others. The veiled masters approached their ancient alghollthu rulers and requested subservient creatures to complete this task. The resulting plizeazoths were impressive in their physical might and ability to efficiently deal pain, but they were immune to such sensations themselves and thus unable to truly comprehend their value within alghollthu society. The brutish beasts are generally content to carry out their masters' orders, with little will of their own or motivation for them to break from their monotonous existence.",

The rare victim who escapes a plizeazoth with her mind and memories intact recounts brutal assaults to her psyche, breaking down her reality into a twisted landscape of pain and crushing despair, the only escape from which, she believed, was eternal servitude to the plizeazoth's master.",

A typical plizeazoth is about 22 feet wide and weighs approximately 4,400 pounds.",

			"Plizeazoths have wide, dark-teal fins that allow them to move stealthily through deep waters. Each plizeazoth has a tentacle on each side of its wide sucking mouth, which it uses both as a natural weapon and to manipulate tools and its environment in the rare event it needs to do either. A plizeazoth's hardened scabrous tail can likewise be employed as a weapon, but the alghollthu lacks the dexterity to do more than simply slam it broadly into an enemy. A plizeazoth's body is malleable, which allows it to easily squeeze into tight caverns and small structures. This also allows it to make subtle alterations to its normal raylike form, moving its vital organs around to accommodate a number of different configurations.",

			"Plizeazoths are kept as something akin to pets by their masters, and the massive brutes rarely stray far from underwater alghollthu cities unless dispatched on a specific task that sends them farther afield. Plizeazoths don't typically create homes or lairs for themselves, and the creatures are content to simply graze near deep trenches for food until they receive a telepathic command that spurs them into action. Plizeazoths are usually solitary creatures, but if the need arises, the veiled masters have been known to give a pair a mission and instructions to cooperate in carrying it out.",

			"",
			"**Deadlight (Su)** Once per round as a free action, the thalassic architect can affix its center eye on one target. The target must succeed at a DC 20 Will saving throw or become transfixed as per [lock gaze](spell/lock_gaze) at caster level 14th. Once a creature has been affected by this ability, it becomes immune to it for 24 hours. The save DC is Charisma-based.",
			"",
			"**Glyph Carver (Su)** A thalassic architect can cause its tentacles to vibrate at an intense frequency when it rends through solid matter, such that the tips can engrave inhuman patterns into solid stone. When activated, the tentacles count as adamantine for the purpose of bypassing DR and hardness. Furthermore, the additional sonic damage caused by the tentacles is treated as energy damage when used as part of a melee attack (as per normal) but is treated as additional normal physical damage when used to perform a sunder combat maneuver. The thalassic architect can turn this ability on or off as a free action. While this ability is activated, the tentacles can't be used to manipulate physical objects, nor can the thalassic architect attempt Stealth checks. While this ability is deactivated, the tentacles cause no sonic damage.",
			"",
			"**Mucus Cloud (Ex)** While underwater, a thalassic architect exudes a cloud of transparent slime in a 100-foot-radius spread. All creatures in this area must succeed at a DC 22 Fortitude save each round or lose the ability to breathe air (and gain the ability to breathe water) for 8 hours. If a creature comes into contact with this mucus cloud again and fails another save, the effect extends for another 8 hours. The save DC is Constitution-based.",
			"",
			"**Slime (Ex)** A creature hit by a thalassic architect's tentacle must succeed at a DC 22 Fortitude save or its skin and flesh transform into a clear, slimy membrane over the course of 1d4 rounds. The target's new \"flesh\" is soft and tender, reducing the creature's Constitution score by 4 as long as the effect persists. If the creature's flesh isn't kept moist, it dries out quickly and the victim takes 1d12 points of damage every 10 minutes. Remove disease and similar effects can restore an afflicted creature to normal, but immunity to disease offers no protection from this attack. The save DC is Constitution-based.",
			"",
			"**Water Manipulation (Su)** A thalassic architect is adept at the telekinetic manipulation of matter, including the waters it inhabits. This at-will ability is a standard action with a duration of concentration + 1 round. The ability functions in two different modes that can be used only one at a time. The architect can force the water around a creature to lock in place and act as a solid, paralyzing the target as per [hold monster](spell/hold_monster) unless the target succeeds at a DC 20 Reflex save. Aside from using effects such as [freedom of movement](spell/freedom_of_movement) or [remove paralysis](spell/remove_paralysis), the target can also break free with a DC 20 Strength check. This ability can affect a creature more than once, but each casting grants a new saving throw. Alternatively, it can thicken water to the consistency of gelatin in a 20-foot radius. Creatures with a swim speed treat this area as difficult terrain. Creatures without a swim speed increase the DC for Swim checks to move through the affected area by 10 (for example, calm underwater areas, usually DC 10, become DC 20). In either case, 5-foot steps become impossible. The save DC is Charisma-based.",
			"",
			"#### Description",
			"",
			"Thalassic architect is a human term for a racial subspecies of aboleth, known as uldraaghus in the language of alghollthus. Uldraaghus were engineered and bred by the mysterious entities that rule the alghollthu race from the deepest oceanic trenches. Whereas aboleths and veiled masters are adept at using telepathy and mental domination, thalassic architects use telekinetic powers to manipulate-even create or destroy-physical matter.",
			"",
			"Uldraaghus more closely resemble veiled masters than they do standard aboleths. They're smaller, being about 15 feet long and weighing 2,800 pounds. Furthermore, they have five eyes instead of three; four are set to either side of their head, while a larger fifth eye is set in the center and glows with a brilliant white light. Thalassic architects have four tentacles, two of which end in clawed appendages capable of manipulating objects. Dark bands of scales typically ring their silvery bodies.",
			"",
			"Uldraaghus were bred to manipulate physical matter without deviating from the piscine form common to alghollthus. The rulers of the alghollthus realized that their vast intelligence had stripped their race of the ability to perform certain physical tasks without lesser beings to assist them. Not content to become utterly dependent on skum and other subservient creatures, alghollthus bred a new subspecies to fulfill this societal role. Initially, the uldraaghus could move and shape only earth and stone, while they directed the ulat-kini to perform the most tedious labor. Now, given thousands of years of evolution, They've developed the skills to break apart and reassemble matter on a minute level. While other creatures can move dozens of small stones, an uldraaghu can seize control of countless individual water molecules.",
			"",
			"An uldraaghu's brain is fundamentally different from that of an alghollthu. It lacks the ability to overwhelm the consciousness of other creatures, though it can still alter their perceptions. Their powers of illusion are seated in the portion of the brain directly behind the central eye, suggesting the center eye is responsible for snaring enemies' attention.",
			"",
			"The two tentacles that lack claws are more dangerous than its other limbs. Uldraaghus can vibrate these tentacles at a frequency so high that the tips can carve glyphs in solid stone.",
			"",
			"**Family:** [Alghollthu](family/alghollthu)",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"Uldraaghus' place in alghollthu society has shifted over the millennia. Once they were considered little better than odd mutants by baseline aboleths-useful but crippled. Two factors have altered their station. First, their powers have grown considerably. Second, their alghollthu masters have always kept their population low.",
			"",
			"The aboleths have grown accustomed to their alien and cyclopean undersea cities, and skum with mundane implements have limited usefulness without direction. Thus, alghollthus rely on uldraaghus to oversee the creation of new structures. A typical construction crew is led by a thalassic architect assisted by standard aboleths, who direct the workers. When the architecture becomes too complex for skum to build efficiently, the uldraaghu completes the structure itself."

A veiled master has 5 hit points restored each time it gives a creature a negative level in this way, and it also learns some of the target creature's memories (subject to the GM's discretion). This is a mind-affecting effect. A veiled master can suppress this ability as a free action. The save DC is Charisma-based.",

Typically, this suggestion (which functions as a spell-like ability, CL 20th, Will DC 19 negates) is for the previously dominated creature to seek out the veiled master and submit to a new domination attempt, but sometimes, a veiled master implants other suggestions (such as a suggestion to attack the first person the creature sees).",

In those ancient times, only elder forces and eldritch entities knew of the world. Even the gods were dismissed and ignored by the aboleth race, for while they were not gods as are known today, aboleths knew themselves capable, given time, of anything the gods could accomplish. And the aboleths have always had time.",

These were the veiled masters-if one were to foolishly attempt to impose human hierarchies upon this alien race, veiled masters would be considered the nobility among their aboleth kin. In truth, while aboleths do treat veiled masters with utmost respect and defer to their decisions, they are not regarded as the rulers of the race. Stranger and still more dangerous entities rule over veiled masters from the deepest trenches below the sea.",
			"",
			"Aboleths are undoubtedly skilled at domination and illusion, but veiled masters are the true experts of the arcane. Veiled masters engineered the deceptions and manipulations of ancient humanity's culture. Their hidden gifts and subtle coaxings did much to encourage humanity's first rise to glory in that age, and in many of those first empires, veiled masters walking among the populace, whispering into their leaders' ears. The people knew the veiled masters as powerful wizards, and there were murmurs that the mysterious cabal was more than human, but few suspected the truth for very long. The veiled masters quelled such suspicions by doing violence to the bodies and minds of those who proved too curious. When the veiled masters first learned of humanity's growing hubris-of their belief that they were greater than their patrons-these manipulators punished humanity. At first, the punishments were minor, yet to the veiled masters' surprise and frustration, they only strengthened humanity's resolve. In the end, destruction was deemed the answer, and as human culture fell into ruins, the veiled masters retreated to the depths of the sea, content for now that the devastation above would serve as a lesson that would never be forgotten.",

Occasionally, an enterprising individual will hunt an almiraj for its horn, but success is limited since almirajes are exceptionally vicious, stealthy, and athletic targets' their acrobatic leaps bring their horns within reach of the vital organs of much larger creatures.",

If the sleeper fails to waken, the alp can use its blood drain ability against the victim and gains a +4 circumstance bonus to the save DC of its nightmare spell-like ability against that creature.

			"Alps are troublesome fey who disturb the dreams and drink the blood of sleeping victims. Unlike other dream-haunting monsters, alps are driven more by their capricious whims than any desire to do harm; when an alp drinks a victim's blood, it always takes care to leave him alive-if only so it can return at a later date to feed again. Alps despise bright light and avoid well-lit rooms, if they can. They enjoy playing pranks and causing minor mishaps. A typical alp stands about 5 feet tall and weighs about 90 pounds."

Those who seek to improve their hunting techniques after these harrowing encounters earn the amaroks' approval, and amaroks are excellent, if harsh, instructors of stalking, tracking, and wrestling techniques.

A creature can attempt a DC 21 Fortitude saving throw at the end of the hour-long process to avoid being preserved; if successful, it remains entangled, but the ambergrim must start the process anew to preserve the creature. Dead and nonliving materials are preserved as if under the effects of an unguent of timelessness. Living creatures are held in stasis, unable to move and no longer needing to eat, drink, or breathe. A living creature can survive in this state for 1 day for each point of Constitution it has, after which it suffocates but remains preserved indefinitely as if by a gentle repose spell. Each day, a preserved creature can attempt a Strength check (DC = 10 + the ambergrim's Constitution modifier) to break free of the amber shell. The shell has hardness 8 and 20 hit points; submerging it in strong alcohol for 1 hour can also dissolve the shell.",
			"",
			"**Swallow Whole (Ex)** An ambergrim can use its swallow whole ability to swallow a creature of its own size category (usually Medium) or smaller. A swallowed creature is entangled, but instead of the Dexterity penalty normally imposed by the entangled condition, it takes a cumulative -1d6 penalty to its Dexterity score each round as the ambergrim coats it in thick resin. If this penalty exceeds the creature's Dexterity score, it is paralyzed until the resin is removed. An ambergrim normally spits out paralyzed prey so it can target a new creature. A paralyzed creature outside the ambergrim that is not affected by its preserve ability can attempt a Strength check (DC = 10 + the ambergrim's Constitution modifier) each round to free itself, but the entangled condition remains as long as any Dexterity penalty persists. The Dexterity penalty decreases by 1 every hour as the resin becomes brittle, or vanishes completely in 1d4 rounds if the resin is doused in strong alcohol.",
			"",
			"#### Description",
			"",
			"Creeping masses of honey-colored slime, ambergrims are scavengers and collectors of the forest, rolling up unwanted bits of undergrowth and unsuspecting animals to preserve for later in timeless stockpiles hidden throughout their domains. Little more than aggressive, human-sized globs of sap and resin, they hunt by the twin graces of surprise and their incredibly sticky bodies, which naturally adhere to other creatures and draw them deeper into the ambergrims' bulk. The oozes' name describes both their rich, warm coloration as well as their ability to immobilize their prey within soft, amber-like capsules, which they can harden into tough cocoons to preserve food for later. Anything from rabbits to unwary human travelers is fit fodder for these oozes' endless hunger.",
			"",
			"Ambergrims vary immensely in size and coloration depending on their environment and parentage, but the most common are roughly 4 feet across and weigh around 200 pounds.",
			"",
			"Ambergrims are aberrations born from a relatively common blight that infects a variety of temperate and arctic trees. The fungus creates large, resinous bulges in the trunk, but upon infecting a treant or similar ambulatory plant, the growth inherits some measure of its parent's mobility and eventually hatches into a newborn ambergrim. Already full-grown and hungry, it wanders away-often ignored by its relieved, erstwhile parent-to begin hunting immediately.",
			"",
			"Ambergrims do not reproduce, making them rare except in cases when blight-obsessed druids cultivate them or groves of treants grow them as guard beasts. Each ooze is effectively immortal, living and hunting until it is destroyed or slowly starves to death.",
			"",
			"With every movement, ambergrims leave a film behind, slightly diminishing themselves with every undulating motion. To make up for this continual loss, they are ravenous, feeding slowly on twigs, leaves, and insects as they creep through the underbrush, but they prefer larger prey. They digest what they can, but in times of plenty they eagerly engulf and preserve additional creatures to store for leaner periods. This hoarding leads many to assume ambergrims possess some rudimentary intellect; however, much like squirrels, the oozes simply stockpile as much food as possible, increasing their odds of coming across a cache months or years later. Desperate wanderers in the forest may be blessed to stumble into an ambergrim's territory and discover its ample stores of food-providing they can escape the notice of the hunter.",
			"",
			"Ambergrims' bodies are made of a sticky, sap-like substance, making them natural grapplers. In quiet times, they hunt passively by sitting motionless and attracting insects and small animals to the sweet scent they exude, trapping such creatures in their adhesive mass. These oozes' cytoplasm hardens into an especially dense crystal, allowing them to coat prey in an impenetrable shell for later consumption. Bits of an ambergrim's surface harden from ordinary exposure to the air when the ooze remains still, forming tough crystalline protuberances that stud its surface. Ambergrims use these as rudimentary teeth to \"bite\" and hold prey as they attempt to engulf it. These same gems also focus light, forming simple eyes that grant the ambergrim unsophisticated vision rarely possessed by other oozes. Able to identify colors and movement, they are among the few oozes that actively hunt, attacking sleeping or otherwise motionless prey that would be invisible to predators that rely wholly on blindsense to locate and target potential meals.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"Treants show a variety of reactions to an ambergrim infection, though most are as repulsed by them as any human might be by a parasite. Many attempt to remove the warty growths before they burst open, but this is a painful process that creates deep and easily infected scars. Rare groves of treants instead form a symbiotic relationship with ambergrims, letting the oozes reproduce in their bodies and using them to keep the treants' forest homes clear of smaller parasites and predators. These groves are then free to engage in to long periods of quiet introspection akin to hibernation, depending on their ambergrim pets to defend their territory as the treants quietly muse and communicate with one another and the trees around them.",
			"",
			"Ambergrims are unintelligent and solitary creatures born by circumstance, but they attract strange attendants. A variety of scavengers follow in their wake, preying on the preserved leftovers the oozes stash in their gemlike cases. Human scavengers flock to ambergrim territory as well, selling the creature's preserved sap as true amber-though it has none of the magical or alchemical properties of true amber-or harvesting those preservative cysts as a valuable ingredient in tanglefoot bags and alchemical glue. Some scholars find use for the ambergrim's preservative powers, either using captive subjects to preserve valuables or else extracting humors from the creatures to mix elixirs and poultices to extend life. On rare occasions, sickly or aging druids or fey actively seek out an ambergrim, hoping its preservative cocoons can sustain them in hibernation to offset their inevitable demise. Though a creature preserved in an ambergrim's preservative gems typically suffocates within a few weeks, the safety of the gem preserves its remains well enough for the creature to be easily resurrected-provided the ambergrim does not return later to make a meal of it."

			"",
			"#### Description",
			"",
			"Ammuts are beastly but cunning creatures that consume souls in an attempt to satisfy their insatiable hungers. Few ammuts exist, and those that do wander the vast deserts of Osirion preying on the souls of any creature they can catch. These creatures prefer the taste of thoroughly evil souls or those who have experienced full and complex lives. Ammuts show disdain for creatures of inferior intelligence, but also tend to leave them alone, as they claim their souls are shallow and flavorless. The rarity of ammuts and their nomadic nature makes it difficult to determine how long they live, or even if they age at all. Ammuts are approximately 20 feet long and 9 feet tall at the shoulder. Their rounded and muscular hindquarters makes them denser than would be expected for their size, and ammuts can weigh up to 10 tons.",
			"",
			"### Ecology",
			"",
			"Ammuts live among the ruins scattered throughout the Osirian deserts, often lairing in abandoned and lost temples of the gods of Ancient Osirion. When outside their lairs, ammuts bury themselves in sand to await the arrival of a suitable meal.",
			"",
			"An ammut is covered in fur ranging from sandy-colored to dark brown, with shorter fur on its back and legs, and a long mane behind its head that covers its shoulders. Its snout and face are layered in reptilian scales that are usually crusted with sand that has partially fused into glass from the heat of its breath.",
			"",
			"Ammuts never tire, and once an ammut notices a creature that it considers suitable prey, it's unrelenting- stalking its prey for hundreds of miles if need be before running it down. These terrifying chases generally don't last long, as the ammut makes use of a high-pitched scream that dazes prey long enough to allow the beast to catch and devour them. If that tactic fails to net the ammut its meal, it can also use its powerful force of will to dominate its prey, using telepathy to convince the victim to approach. Creatures that try to hide from an ammut using illusions soon find those plans foiled, as ammuts can see through illusions cast by even the most powerful mages. The only way to truly escape an ammut once it selects you as its quarry is to confront and defeat the beast.",
			"",
			"Fire burns within the core of an ammut, and the heat generated by an ammut's inner fires can sometimes fuse the sand it passes through into glassy depressions in the desert floor. The best desert guides can recognize these signs (called \"blaze bowls\") and avoid areas in which an ammut might be lurking.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"Ammuts are lone predators, and are so rare their social structures (if any) and method of reproduction are unknown. No live specimen has ever been caught for observation, because the inner fires of the ammut consume the creature's body quickly upon its death, leaving little to be studied besides ash and brittle glass formed from fused sand. Every so often, a peddler in the markets of Eto or Shiman-Sekh will claim to possess a rare piece of an ammut's body (such as one of its teeth or an eye) that they try to sell to foreigners and treasure hunters. Most native Osirians know to ignore such claims, but outsiders may be gullible enough to buy the extremely expensive fakes as souvenirs. One of the few things peddled in these markets that actually has a connection to ammuts are pieces of their blaze bowls. Sometimes brave explorers come across one of these glassy depressions, and remain in the area long enough to try to carefully remove the fused sand in one whole piece. More often than not these efforts are fruitless, as the brittle glass often crumbles if mishandled.",
			"",
			"Because ammuts are so rare, the libraries of Osirion contain records of only two-dozen confirmed sightings, though it's likely that many more encounters ended with no one left to report the event. Osirian scholars have estimated, based more on reports of the telltale blaze bowls than of actual ammuts, that there are perhaps twenty to thirty of the creatures roaming the vast wasteland between the Junira River and the River Sphinx, though a single sighting near the Ruins of Tumen suggests the ammuts are not confined between those waterways. No record of a peaceful encounter with an ammut exists, suggesting that they have no interest in anything other than feeding on the souls of those who cross their paths.",
			"",
			"The origin of the ammuts is shrouded in mystery, though it's thought that they descended from a single creature of their kind that was more powerful than all existing ammuts combined. This mythical ammut is sometimes referred to in Ancient Osiriani scrolls where it has the position of judging the souls of the dead-a role already assumed by Pharasma. Because of this conflict, scholars argue about the creatures' true origin.",
			"",
			"Though it is generally agreed that ammuts migrated to Golarion from another plane long ago, many scholars disagree on the exact planar origin. Some scholars claim that ammuts are perhaps descended from a race of devils, while others claim the lineage stems from the divs. The most logical association of a fiendish origin is rooted in daemonkind. That ammuts are connected with souls and have the ability to utterly consume them certainly lends to this hypothesis."

A weaker cousin of creatures such as the gray ooze and black pudding, a giant amoeba is actually a mutated version of a harmless creature too small to be seen by the naked eye, grown dangerously large in size. Although happy to prey on creatures smaller than it, the giant amoeba's constant hunger often drives it to attack larger prey, such as humanoids."

			"**Impale (Ex)** If an amphiptere confirms a critical hit with its tail attack against a creature smaller than itself, the spike-tipped tail impales the target creature. An impaled creature gains the pinned condition (though the amphiptere doesn't gain the grappled condition), takes 1d6 points of bleed damage, and automatically takes damage from the amphiptere's tail each round it remains pinned. An amphiptere can't constrict a creature it has impaled, nor can it use its tail attack while it is impaling a creature, but it doesn't need to succeed at a grapple combat maneuver check to maintain the grapple. An amphiptere can release an impaled creature as a free action.",

Additionally, amphipteres can attempt a DC 15 Fly check to fall safely from any height without taking falling damage, as if under the effects of feather fall. When falling safely, an amphiptere can attempt an additional DC 15 Fly check to glide, allowing it to move 5 feet laterally for every 10 feet it falls.",

They're also longer and much leaner than wyverns, and instead of a wyvern's poisonous stinger, an amphiptere has a broad, arrow-shaped spur at the end of its long tail. Capable of piercing armor and shattering bone, an amphiptere's tail skewers prey much like a fisher might spear a fish.",

Some reports even claim lizard-like versions of this beast exists, with short legs and long curved talons.",

In combat, it uses this ability to its utmost advantage, constantly spinning about to change up the direction of its strikes and guarding against enemies attempting to sneak closer or flank it. Unlike most snakes, amphisbaenas are aggressive, attacking anything that enters their territory. While they prefer smaller prey, they have been known to hunt gnomes, halflings, and other Small humanoids, and will sometimes attack larger foes if they're starving or preparing to shed.",
			"",
			"Amphisbaenas reproduce infrequently, laying small clutches of up to a dozen dark onyx eggs at a time. Avidly sought by animal trainers and collectors, amphisbaena eggs can fetch between 300 to 500 gp on the market. Despite minimal intelligence, amphisbaenas are driven primarily by their instincts and are extremely difficult and dangerous to train.

The anemos gains infusions and utility talents listed under its other special abilities, but doesn't gain any other abilities of a 20th-level kineticist.",
			"",
			"**Earthbane (Su)** An anemos's windblessed ability and regeneration are suppressed whenever any part of the creature is submerged at least 1 inch into earth (including dirt, mud, or clay).

			"",
			"**Infusions (Su)** An anemos has access to the kineticist form and substance infusions listed in its Special Attacks entry, which it can apply to any of the blasts granted by its aerokinesis ability without needing to accept burn. This applies to only the base burn cost; an anemos can't accept additional burn to gain a greater effect with infusions such as pushing infusion.",

			"**Utility Wild Talents (Sp, Su)** An anemos gains access to the kineticist utility wild talents listed in its SQ entry.",
			"",
			"**Wind Form (Ex)** An anemos can cause its body to become more diffuse than normal, losing its human-shaped coherence and instead becoming a formless and invisible wind. When an anemos enters wind form, it automatically escapes from any grapples or bindings that managed to hold it despite its freedom of movement, and gains the natural invisibility ability, but can't use aerokinesis or its spear attack.",
			"",
			"**Wind Orchestra (Su)** An anemos can use the winds themselves as wind instruments, which count as masterwork instruments for the purpose of its Perform (wind instruments) skill. It can use its winds to duplicate the effects of the countersong or dirge of doom bardic performances as if it were a bard with a number of rounds of bardic performance per day equal to its Charisma bonus. Beginning this performance is a swift action.",
			"",
			"**Windblessed (Su)** An anemos is like a god unto the wind, and the wind zealously protects it. It gains a deflection bonus to its AC equal to its Charisma bonus. An anemos is never affected by winds or weather effects unless it chooses to be.",
			"",
			"#### Description",
			"",
			"Anemoi are godlike beings from the Plane of Air, masters of the storm and sky. While an anemos appears humanoid in shape, even a cursory glance reveals that its humanlike appearance is a complete facade, for its 6-foot-tall body is composed of solidified air, has no vital organs, and is nearly weightless. The winds themselves obey an anemos, and greater sky deities often task four anemoi with controlling the wind patterns for an entire world on the Material Plane.",
			"",
			"Implacable but not malevolent, an anemos guides its winds along the paths dictated by nature, heedless of how the weather patterns help or harm the creatures in their paths, whether through drought, flood, tornadoes, or hurricanes. Mighty heroes sometimes trap an anemos in earth and force it to protect the heroes' allies or destroy their enemies in exchange for its freedom. While an anemos always honors such agreements, such heroes may find the weather turning against them at a crucial moment many years later.",
			"",
			"Anemoi generally have little to do with their own kind, though they may hold court with a plethora of lesser air creatures. Councils of anemoi occur perhaps once every millennium, when the four anemoi who oversee a particular world assemble to confer and debate. Their personalities take on aspects of the winds they guide, and such councils often end in duels of winds, though such duels are always nonlethal due to the anemoi's regeneration.",
			"",
			"Anemoi are particularly fond of music, particularly that of wind instruments, and each can perform as a full wind ensemble with its own winds simultaneously. They appreciate musical talent in their followers, allowing sirens and other creatures with musical skills to join their courts. Despite anemoi's aloofness, skilled mortal musicians can earn their way into the creatures' good graces, and romance between anemoi and mortals, while extraordinarily rare, is not impossible.",
			"",
			"Though they are beings of air, anemoi usually choose to appear in humanoid form. Many sylphs, sorcerers with an air elemental bloodline, and aerokineticists make grandiose claims about anemos descent, but only a handful have the pedigree to support those claims, and they tend to become notable heroes and villains in their own right.",
			"",
			"### Elder Anemoi",
			"",
			"While all anemoi are ancient beings with incredible abilities, elder anemoi are closer in power to true gods. Rather than serving as members of councils that control the winds on a world in the Material Plane, the elder anemoi each control notable regions on the Elemental Plane of Air with powerful wind features, such as the Living Hurricane and the Foreverstorm.",
			"",
			"Anemoi typically become elder anemoi only after tending a world's winds from that world's infancy to its destruction, which would make elder anemoi older than most mortals can fathom. Elder anemoi possess all the powers of a typical anemos as well as 10 mythic ranks and several powerful abilities unique to each individual elder anemos.",
			"",
			"### Cardinal Wind Abilities",
			"",
			"An anemos who is assigned to guide one of a world's winds gains an additional special ability tied to that wind.",
			"",
			"Austral: Once per day, as a swift action, an anemos who guides the south winds can whip them into a frenzied dust storm. The storm encompasses a cylinder with a 30-foot radius centered on the anemos, and is 60 feet high. It deals 20d6 points of fire damage to other creatures within the cylinder, blinds them for 1d4 rounds, and knocks them prone. A successful DC 31 Fortitude save halves the damages and negates the other effects.",
			"",
			"Boreal: Once per day, as a swift action, an anemos who guides the north winds can send forth a blast of ice slivers from its hand in a 30-foot line. This shredding blast deals 20d6 points of cold damage to anything in its path, as well as 2d4 points of Dexterity damage, and a damaged creature moves at half speed for 1d4 rounds as the ice infuses its limbs. A successful DC 31 Reflex save halves the cold damage and negates the other effects.",
			"",
			"Eural: Once per day, an anemos who guides the eastern winds can use them to bring misfortune to any creatures they touch. Creatures within 60 feet of the anemos must attempt a DC 31 Will save to avoid suffering bad luck. If a creature succeeds, its close brush with disaster leaves it shaken for 1d6 rounds. If it fails, for the next 6 rounds, anytime it attempts an ability check, attack roll, saving throw, or skill check, it must roll twice and take the worse result.",
			"",
			"Zephyr: Once per day, an anemos who guides the western winds can soothe the spirits of any creature touched by its gentle breezes. For 1 minute, creatures within 60 feet of the anemos must attempt DC 31 Will saves each time they attempt to attack or take aggressive actions toward another creature. If a creature succeeds, it can attack as normal. If it fails, it can't attack and is staggered for 1 minute."

Whether this intelligence is the product of evolution or meddling by unholy powers, all angazhani honor the demon lord Angazhan. Reclusive by nature, high girallon clans settle the most secluded depths of the jungles, generally inhabiting ruined cities and misty mountain temples. There they rule as divine priestkings over tribes of lesser apes. These congregations sometimes even include humanoid slaves or cultists, though the angazhani prefer raiding and collect tribute over commanding direct service. They rarely reveal themselves to outsiders, and instead quietly gather strength against the day their patron sends them out to claim all the world's forests.",

A cassisian's protective aura is fragile, and as soon as an evil creature successfully strikes the cassisian, or as soon as the cassisian fails a saving throw against an evil source, its protective aura fades away and is no longer applicable. The cassisian can reactivate its protective aura by spending 1 minute concentrating upon the task.",

			"#### Description",
			"",
			"Cassisians are the weakest sort of angel, but are absolutely dedicated to the cause of good. They serve as messengers for more powerful angels, and on the Material Plane they are often bound to good mortals to serve as familiars, acting as spiritual guides, reciting platitudes and quoting scripture from various benign faiths and philosophies (some forgotten for centuries). A 7th-level lawful good with the Improved Familiar feat can select a cassisian as a familiar.",
			"",
			"A cassisian's true form is a helmet possessing a pair of bird's wings. The exact style of helmet varies by the deity the angel serves-most appear to be steel with angular cheek-plates, though some resemble bascinets, skullcaps, great helms, or even samurai helmets, and a few older cassisians appear to be bronze or even leather. Though cassisians can assume other forms (that of a child-sized angelic humanoid wearing a proportional helmet matching the cassisians' true form, a dove, a dog, or a fish), they find it strange and rarely stay in that form for more than a few minutes.",
			"",
			"Typically formed from the souls of trustworthy and pious soldiers, some cassisians arise spontaneously from the spiritual fragments of great angels destroyed while defending the celestial planes against fiendish incursions. In many cases, the lowly cassisian retains fragments of its previous life's memories, and friends of that old soul may visit with the cassisian to reminisce with what remains. Unfortunately, the reincarnated angel's memories are more like something memorized from a book, and lack the character and camaraderie the friends expect.",

Each evil-aligned enemy in a 20-foot-radius burst takes 2d8 points of damage and is blinded for 1 round. A successful DC 15 Will saving throw reduces the damage by half and negates the blinded effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.",

The erelim's melee attacks deal 2d4 additional points of damage to the target (or 2d6 points of damage to evil outsiders).

The mount glows with a brightness equivalent to a daylight spell. Only the erelim who conjured it can ride the mount, and the erelim must be astride the mount to use celestial charge and inspiring presence. An erelim can dismiss the mount as a free action.",

Many paladins, cavaliers, and other crusaders find themselves among this legion after death, but even a humble peasant may find herself among the knights of Heaven so long as she stood up to evil while others backed down. The appearances of the angels may vary greatly from the mortal forms they once inhabited, and many erelims arise from the celestial planes spontaneously-from wisps of soulstuff collected from a dozen or more brave petitioners-rather than emerging from a single, courageous warrior. They may present a huge variety of racial features in one stunningly beautiful and athletic form.",

They serve as the cavalry for celestial forays into the evil Outer Planes, but lack the cunning and restraint to act as covert agents. Despite their zeal, erelims are careful to avoid civilian injuries or destruction, and work to steer conflicts away from unaffiliated settlements.",
			"",
			"Very rarely, erelims take mortal form on the Material Plane to act as knights or field marshals for armies they deem righteous. These erelims are fair but uncreative strategists, relying heavily on straightforward tactics and superior numbers to win the day. While erelims see any resulting casualties as a failure of their leadership, they tolerate the deaths so long as an important objective is won in the process. Erelims on the Material Plane attempt to disguise their celestial nature, only reverting to their true forms in times of desperation. Once danger has passed, such revealed erelims return to the Outer Planes.",
			"",
			"The concept of relaxation is alien to erelims. Their free time is filled with endless drills, jousts, patrols, and short breaks to maintain their weapons or strategize with other angels. Such a warlike existence leaves them suited for little else. Even in times of peace, most erelims find it difficult to lay their duty aside and embrace simple pleasures; without some measure of routine, many become anxious and reactionary, seeking conflict even when engaged in the most mundane activities.",
			"",
			"Erelims who serve together in a celestial formation share a camaraderie akin to that of many mortal armies. Members of an erelim formation learn to act in harmony, and grow as close as siblings, able to coordinate and work together without speaking a word. Multiple formations brought together into a single host often develop friendly rivalries, becoming especially competitive in battle, to the point of recklessness. Celestial commanders frown upon this divergence in the ranks, but can rarely discourage the boisterous angels for long.",
			"",
			"### Calling an Erelim",
			"",
			"Erelims can be called with planar ally, and the payment they require depends on the boldness of the request. These angels belittle any tasks that don't test their mettle or call for incredible heroism, and demand to be presented with extravagant weapons or for large sums to be donated to an appropriate church. Conversely, they exuberantly agree to requests that put them in direct conflict with powerful evil beings, and often ask no more of the callers than to fight alongside them as equals. Erelims do not accept obviously suicidal tasks, but sometimes vastly underestimate the threat mortal dangers can pose."

			"Iophanites comprise a unique classification of messenger angel in service to Iomedae. Energetic, enthusiastic, impulsive, and outgoing, it constantly looks for ways to aid the forces of righteousness in the wars against fiends and villainy. As a being of pure righteous spirit in a burning physical form, an iophanite is often confused for an exotic form of harbinger or lantern archon. Its form is slightly mutable, and it can deform itself into an oval curved like a shield, or manifest simple tendrils to manipulate objects or lash out at opponents. When interacting with mortals, an iophanite usually manifests ripples of flames or pulses of light that thrum in time with its speaking. Most creatures have a difficult time telling iophanites apart, but these angels can always recognize each other.",
			"",
			"Iophanites are talkative and have excellent memories, making them naturally inclined to carry news, battle orders, and other critical information. Their bodies are hot to the touch, but do not ignite combustibles unless the iophanite wishes it, allowing it to carry scrolls or other flammable goods without risk of destroying them. Of the lawful angels, they tend to be the most creative in terms of working around rules and the most forgiving of others' failures. They are also inclined to serve as the guardians of mortals, being mindful of virtuous and selfsacrificing heroes who might be destined for greatness in much the same way Iomedae herself was.",

			"",
			"- Eagle: The kuribu's face and voice become more birdlike. Once every 1d4 rounds, the kuribu can let out an ear-piercing screech as a standard action. All creatures in a 15-foot cone take 1d6 points of sonic damage (Fortitude DC 13 half). Creatures with 4 Hit Dice or fewer that fail their saving throws are dazed for 1 round. The save DC is Constitution-based.",
			"- Human: The kuribu's face becomes like a mask, and the angel gains the freeze extraordinary ability, allowing the kuribu to take 20 on Stealth checks to hide in plain sight as a marble statue of a kuribu. The kuribu can appear as a statue indefinitely. Most kuribus first present this face when dealing with mortals, changing to one of their other faces only if combat begins.",
			"- Lion: The kuribu develops a fearsome set of jaws capable of making bite attacks. This is a primary natural attack (with a +5 attack bonus) that deals 1d4 points of damage.",
			"- Ox: The kuribu's face grows sterner and body grows sturdier. The angel gains a +4 resistance bonus on Fortitude saving throws and a +4 to CMD against bull rush and trip combat maneuvers.",
			"",
			"**Lesser Protective Aura (Su)** A kuribu has a lesser form of the protective aura possessed by more powerful angels. This protective aura grants the kuribu a +2 deflection bonus to AC against evil foes, and a +2 resistance bonus on all saving throws made against evil effects or spells cast by evil creatures (this does not stack with the resistance bonus from the kuribu's ox countenance). This aura extends to a radius of 5 feet, but can benefit only two additional creatures other than the kuribu at any one time. A kuribu's protective aura is fragile, and as soon as an evil creature successfully strikes the angel, or as soon as the kuribu fails a saving throw against an evil source, the protective aura fades away and is no longer applicable. The kuribu can reactivate the protective aura by spending 1 minute concentrating upon the task.",
			"",
			"#### Description",
			"",
			"Though one of the least powerful kinds of angels, kuribus are trusted with the protection of sacred places such as churches and blessed bowers. Their ability to stay as still as statues allows them to stand sentinel over their charges for decades, or even centuries. When their guarded locations are invaded, kuribus take flight and pepper their foes with arrows, altering their countenances as the situation requires. If outmatched or outnumbered, the majority of a flight of kuribus sacrifice themselves, while a lone kuribu retreats to fetch reinforcements, be it angels from a higher choir or a nearby hero.",
			"",
			"Kuribus look like small, round-cheeked humanoids, and have pale, flawless skin that is actually as tough as stone. This both aids them in disguising themselves as statues and affords them protection. Their child-like forms lend them an air of purity and innocence. A kuribu has two sets of wings, with the smaller pair at the base of the spine allowing a greater amount of control when flying. A typical kuribu stands 3 feet tall but weighs 60 pounds as a result of the angel's dense, stonelike flesh.",
			"",
			"Kuribus are fashioned from the souls of good mortals who died protecting a treasured place or ideal. As these spirits traverse the River of Souls, they undergo several metamorphoses, gaining the qualities that eventually become their blessed aspects. The majority of kuribus can take on the countenances of eagles, lions, and oxen, but a few variant kuribus possessing the aspects of different animals do exist. However, all kuribus can blend in with the architecture of a church, appearing as innocent-looking statues with wide eyes and plump cheeks.",
			"",
			"Kuribus have a remarkable amount of patience and tolerance for boredom, as they may be assigned to watch over particular locations for years. Mortal generations pass swiftly for kuribus, with years blurring in much the same way days might for mortals. However, their senses are always alert, and the slightest destructive act against their charges can cause them to spring into action. While this self-defensiveness certainly extends to vandals and evil beasts, kuribus have boundless patience for the birds and small mammals that sometimes make homes upon their bodies or shelter beneath their wings. While kuribus would never let a terrible crime transpire before their eyes just to protect a pigeon's comfort, there have been instances of these angels revealing themselves only after their avian residents have migrated away for the season. This has more to do with kuribus' otherworldly sense of urgency and time than any particular affinity for animals.",
			"",
			"**Family:** [Angel](family/angel)",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"As kuribus protect sacred areas, they are witness to, but rarely interact with, many different types of good-aligned outsiders. Unless these outsiders seek to cause harm, the kuribus see no reason to interrupt them on their business. As such, other angels tend to consider kuribus to be more decoration than fellow animate beings. Kuribus think nothing of this prejudice, as they are confident in the importance of their duties.",
			"",
			"Occasionally, an angel important enough to employ a flight of kuribus to safeguard their own sanctum will develop a certain fondness for the smaller outsiders. The overseer angel speaks pleasantly with the kuribus, keeping them informed of the important events of the Outer Sphere, not expecting responses. In turn, the kuribus grow fiercely loyal to the more powerful angel. Eventually, this relationship blossoms into something more familial and playful, the kuribus trying to move from their positions without the other angel noticing. In times of crisis, however, this whimsy is immediately dropped in favor of the defense of the holy sanctum.",
			"",
			"On the other hand, kuribus rarely form close relationships with other kuribus. When part of a flight that protects a single location, kuribus work together well, but solely as professional associates and nothing more. If, for some reason, a single kuribu has different ideas than the rest of the flight about the best way to defend their charge, that angel quickly falls in line with the others. Kuribus hold their duties above their pride.",
			"",
			"In rare cases, kuribus might find themselves lingering in areas that were once holy but have been abandoned or despoiled. In such cases, a kuribu often stoically waits for goodly folk to return, whether as a congregation restoring the site or heroes who might help cast out a lingering evil.",
			"",
			"### Calling a Kuribu",
			"",
			"The payment requested by a kuribu called with lesser planar ally is often a donation that helps to rebuild or refurbish a church or other holy site. As a kuribu considers these places to be very important to the appropriate deity, the angel will halve any payment required if asked to guard such a location. A few kuribus even accept long-term, open-ended requests to protect a piece of sacred ground from a worthy caller. A small number of cathedrals on the Material Plane are home to kuribus selected for such a service decades ago, and whose original callers have long since passed away."

They fade away when the ninkonda dies and cannot be used by any other creature. As a standard action, a ninkonda can fling a volley of four spikes from their arms. Make a separate attack roll for each spike-all targets must be within 30 feet of each other. The spikes have a range increment of 20 feet. The spikes are treated as +4 darts with the same weapon special ability as the ninkonda's fists. Whether the attacks hit or miss, these spikes immediately disappear and reappear back in the ninkonda's body.",
			"",
			"**Reflect Rays (Su)** Rays and ranged touch effects that strike a ninkonda but fail to overcome the angel's spell resistance are reflected back at their source, using the original attack roll to determine whether they hit. The ninkonda must be aware of the attack and not flat-footed.",
			"",
			"**Soul Reflection (Su)** A ninkonda can angle the mirror in their chest to reflect the weaknesses of creatures' souls. Each round as a swift action, the ninkonda can project a 60-foot cone of contrition. All creatures in the cone fall prone with grief and remorse, taking no actions for as long as they are within 60 feet of the ninkonda (Will DC 25 negates). A lawful creature gains a +4 bonus on this saving throw, and a good creature gains a +8 bonus on the saving throw (these bonuses stack). Sightless creatures cannot be affected by this ability, nor can creatures that cast no reflection (such as vampires). This is a mind-affecting compulsion effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.",

			"#### Description",
			"",
			"Ninkondas, or \"nail angels,\" are stoic, remorseless hunters of the celestial planes. At a distance, a ninkonda appears to be a winged knight wearing full plate armor. Up close, the creatures present a more intimidating and bizarre appearance: dozens of iron spikes impale their arms, shoulders, and hands, and the faceplates of their helms are smooth and featureless. Ninkondas hunt once-honorable mortals who have committed heinous sins, such as treason against good nations or betrayal of celestial confidences. Ninkondas don't slay their quarry; instead they wordlessly encourage redemption by reflecting the creature's soul in the mirror inset in the angels' broad chests.",
			"",
			"Ninkondas stand 12 feet tall with wingspans of just over 25 feet. They weigh about 1,200 pounds.",
			"",
			"Although ninkondas resemble stout, armored humanoids with feathered golden wings, the armor is the creatures' thick skin and their cumbersome appearances bely their natural grace. Ninkondas have no faces; a blank helm topped with a golden crown sits atop each ninkonda's thick neck. Despite lacking facial features, ninkondas have supernaturally sharp senses and can speak in a deep, somber voice (although they rarely choose to do so). Ninkondas are good at recognizing truth and find dishonesty particularly repugnant.",
			"",
			"The iron spikes that impale ninkondas' arms and shoulders are physical manifestations of their past misdeeds. These spikes cause ninkondas a constant dull ache rather than a sharp pain, but ninkondas embrace this discomfort as an ever-present reminder of how wickedness can be overcome. The reflection in the broad mirror across a ninkonda's chest is always hazy and inexact, as it shows spiritual truth rather than physical reality.",
			"",
			"Ninkondas watch for evidence of wicked mortals who might harbor a spark of goodness within them. A ninkonda who identifies a candidate for redemption pursues this quarry tirelessly, dispatching the mortal's irredeemable lackeys (such as undead and fiends) with nail-studded fists and confronting the mortal personally. In the ninkonda's broad chest-mirror, the quarry sees not only the stains on its own soul but the repercussions of all its past transgressions. For those who are truly repentant when confronted so directly with their wickedness, the ninkonda offers atonement and helps them back onto the path leading a righteous life.",

			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"Ninkondas are few in number. Though they originate from the ranks of archons, only the most erudite scholars of Heaven can describe how ninkondas come into existence. Many archons begin as virtuous mortal spirits who are transformed into lantern archons or other lesser servitors, then ascend predictably through the hierarchy of Heaven. Some of these virtuous spirits, however, have not always been so: some lived mortal lives of startling wickedness before repenting of their evil ways and joining the ranks of Heaven. Although the archons do not fault each other for mortal wrongs, a rare few archons dwell on their own dimly remembered misdeeds. These transgressions vex their thoughts like splinters. Eventually, some of these archons decide that redeeming other mortal wrongdoers is a higher calling than the service of Heaven's hierarchies; when such archons advance, they slip from the usual ranks and are reborn as ninkondas. Their mortal misconduct takes physical form in the spikes that pierce their flesh.",
			"",
			"Ninkondas prefer to work alone, but form small squads against groups that fell into wickedness together (such as a band of desperate revolutionaries or a couple of accidental murderers). The ninkondas hope to redeem all the members of such groups together, so that they can find strength and courage in each other's company once the ninkondas have gone. Ninkondas working together rarely confer, instead deferring automatically to the most experienced among their number.",
			"",
			"### Beyond Gender",
			"",
			"Outsiders do not reproduce sexually, and have existences that transcend the understanding of mortals. Some types of outsiders, especially angels, are genderless in their natural states. While some angels may choose to adopt a gender, whether it is one reflected in the real world or otherwise, most do not. A genderless creature has no gender entry on the race and class line of their stat block, and is referred to with the singular \"they\" in running text and ability descriptions."
