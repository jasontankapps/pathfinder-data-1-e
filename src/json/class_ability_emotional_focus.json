To be affected, an enemy must be within 30 feet of the phantom and able to hear it. This effect persists as long as the enemy is within 30 feet (the phantom can end the oration as a free action). This ability cannot cause a creature to become frightened or panicked, even if the target was already shaken from another effect. This is a mind-affecting fear effect that relies on audible components.",

If the phantom loses its immunity to fear, all doubled morale bonuses that are affecting the phantom are instead applied as penalties for the remainder of their duration or until the phantom regains its immunity to fear (whichever comes first).",

The phantom gains a bonus on melee damage rolls equal to its Charisma modifier. However, whenever the phantom deals damage to a creature, the creature can attempt a Will save (DC = 10 + 1/2 the phantom's Hit Dice + the phantom's Charisma modifier) to disbelieve the effect, reducing the bonus on damage rolls by half if successful. The phantom can use illusion of perfection for a number of minutes per day equal to its Hit Dice. This duration need not be used all at once, but must be expended in 1-minute intervals. This ability is a mind-affecting illusion effect."
