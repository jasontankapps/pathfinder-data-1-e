A single dose of any pharmaceutical weighs only a tenth of a pound-no entry for weight is given for the following item descriptions. Individual doses of pharmaceuticals can take various forms, from an injected serum to an ingested pill. Each pharmaceutical is assumed to contain a means of delivery included in its weight and cost. Any pharmaceutical can be used with a medlance to speed up its administration time, regardless of its form.",

Azonite pellets were the typical answer to radiation exposure-a less expensive alternative to cureall. An azonite pellet grants a +5 bonus on all saving throws against radiation for 1 hour. Taking multiple pellets resets the duration, but doesn't increase the bonus. Taking 5 pellets at once instantly cures all Strength damage caused by radiation poisoning, but doesn't cure Strength damage caused by any other effect.

A single dose of soothe dulls pain and creates a euphoric sensation, particularly when applied to an open wound. Rubbing a dose of soothe onto one's skin or imbibing the faintly citrusflavored stuff cures 1 point of damage, but rubbing a dose onto a wound received in the last minute heals the user of 1d8 points of damage. In addition, for the next minute, the user becomes immune to bleed damage and gains a +2 morale bonus on saving throws against fear effects. As a somewhat unusual and disturbing side effect, wounds healed by soothe tend to form raw, unsightly scars, giving the appearance of the wound still being fresh but disturbingly bloodless. Soothe has a further side effect-the stuff is slightly addictive, and those who use it run the danger of developing a habit. Soothe's side effect of transforming wounds into raw, ugly scar tissue tends to make those who abuse the drug-like pharmaceutical increasingly into hideous monstrosities over time. In fact, some subcultures, like the Smilers of Scrapwall, use this side effect to make themselves appear more ferocious, and openly encourage self-mutilation followed by healing via of this strange substance."
