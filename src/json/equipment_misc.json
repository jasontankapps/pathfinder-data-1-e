			"",
			"**Crafting Antivenom:** To create a dose of antivenom, a living creature must first be exposed to a half dose of the poison in question. The creature suffers the poison's effects normally, except the saving throw DC to resist the poison is reduced by 2. In order to be able to produce antivenom, the creature must succeed at the necessary saving throws to be cured of the poison. If the poison's duration expires without the creature being cured, no antivenom can be harvested. Once the creature has resisted the poison's effects, a viable sample of the creature's blood can be extracted with a successful DC 20 Craft (alchemy) or Heal check. This blood must then be refined to extract the natural antibodies that combat the poison in a process that takes 1 hour and requires a successful Craft (alchemy) check (DC = 5 + the poison's saving throw DC). Success yields 1 dose of antivenom. Antivenom can also be harvested in the same fashion from a creature that has been afflicted by a full dose of poison, rather than a creature deliberately given a half dose for this purpose. Regardless of how much poison the creature is exposed to, the antibodies in its system can be harvested only for 24 hours after it has recovered from the poison.",
			"",
			"**Purchasing Antivenom:** Antivenom is not particularly expensive, but because it is highly specialized, it can be difficult to find. A dose of antivenom has a market price equal to half the market price of a dose of the poison in question, but it is treated as though its price were five times the market price of the poison for the purposes of determining its availability in any given settlement. Alternatively, if 1 or more doses of the poison in question can be provided, most alchemists will supply as much antivenom as they can produce from the doses for a fee of 10% of the market price of the poison.",

			"Typically stored in an airtight leather wineskin cured with rare preservative unguents, bone paste is a powerful alchemical sealant with special deteriorative properties. When squeezed out of its container and exposed to air, bone paste quickly hardens, so in order to apply it to a surface or object one must typically squeeze the paste directly onto the material to be affected. Once applied, bone paste cements itself to the object in just seconds, and hardens into a flaky cast. If applied to any unattended organic material or surface (such as wood, paper, hide, or rope), after 1 hour, bone paste undergoes another alchemical reaction and begins to eat away at the material, dealing 1d4 points of damage each round for 1d6+1 rounds, eating away first at the part of the object to which it was applied and spreading briefly to other parts of the object before dissipating and leaving a small amount of residual dust. Bone paste ignores an organic object's hardness, and does not deal damage to inorganic objects or surfaces (such as metal, stone, or ceramic). One pouch of bone paste is enough to cover 1 square foot of surface, or (because of waste and spills) up to 20 smaller applications of approximately 2 square inches each.",

It takes 1 minute to apply a paste of camouflage lichen spores to the skin, and an additional 24 hours for the fungus to sprout.

To use a code rod, a long, narrow strip of paper is wrapped around the rod in a spiral pattern such that the edge of the paper touches the previous circuit with each pass, forming a continuous surface. A message is written along the length of the rod, one character to each coil of paper, row by row, until the paper is full. Once the message is completed, the strip of paper is unwound, rendering the message indecipherable. It can then be rolled up and sent to the recipient, who wraps it around the other rod and can then read the message. The users can write in plain language or further encode the message.

Because of the sudden jerk, a creature holding a contracting rope must succeed at a DC 10 Climb check to avoid dropping it as it contracts (unless it is knotted around the creature's waist, clamped in a locked gauntlet, or otherwise firmly attached to the creature). The rope fails to contract if it would pull more than 1,000 pounds horizontally or lift more than 250 pounds vertically.

Oread jewelers found that these crystals, dubbed fleshgems, seemed to feed on the elemental energy that permeates an oread's flesh, growing from tiny chips of stone into large, elaborate gemstones. Essentially harmless, implanting fleshgems became a unique racial method of body alteration among oreads, equivalent to tattoos and piercings among other humanoids. Decorative fleshgems cost 1 gp and are merely ornamental. Fleshgem spikes, on the other hand, grow into elaborate crystalline shards that function as armor spikes, but the oread wearing them cannot wear armor over the spikes and even normal clothing requires special holes or seams to allow the spikes to stick out. Implanting a set of fleshgem spikes takes 10 minutes, and the resulting shard takes about a week to grow to full size. Removing a fleshgem takes 1 minute; the person removing the gem must make a successful DC 15 Heal check to avoid dealing 1d4 points of damage to the oread. The fleshgem spikes can be sundered or destroyed as if the growths were a worn object (hardness 1, 5 hp), but unless the embedded root of the fleshgem is removed, the shards grow back 1 week later."

Additionally, half-elves are keenly aware of the effort put into the leaves' growth and normally only sell the products of their labors to others of their kind. When the golden maple's delicate, five-pointed leaves finally take on their namesake's color, they can be cut, dried, and then ground into a fine powder, a process that requires a DC 15 Knowledge (nature) or Profession (herbalist) check. When used in conjunction with the Craft (alchemy) skill to create special substances and items like alchemical grease or tanglefoot bags, golden maple leaves reduce the Craft DC by 5 and add +1 to the DC of any save required by the alchemical item.

Such barding is usually designed to look similar to the armor of the horse's rider, or to look skeletal, fiendish, or similar to a nightmare. Hellknight barding can be made from Hellknight leather, Hellknight plate, or Hellknight half-plate; it costs four times as much and weighs twice as much. Hellknight leather barding slows a mount from 40 feet to 30 feet, from 50 feet to 35 feet, or from 60 feet to 40 feet. Hellknight half-plate barding or Hellknight plate barding also slows a mount, and a mount wearing such armor moves at only triple its normal speed when running instead of quadruple."

A kiss delivers the full dose of the poison, and that application of poison lip paint then becomes nonpoisonous.

Any creature can sweep the salts aside as a move action (or as a full-round action for an attuned creature, which deals that creature 2d4 points of acid damage in the process); moderate wind also disperses all repellent salts in a square (including the draft created by a winged creature of at least Medium size that flies within 5 feet of the salts). Alternatively, a vial of repellent salts can be used as a splash weapon against the target creature, with a successful hit dealing 2d4 points of acid damage to the creature struck (or 1 point to an attuned creature within 5 feet of the target and thus exposed to the attack's splash)."

Items other than weapons and armor have a 10% chance to gain the broken condition with each day of use, and if they have a limited number of uses, they have half as many uses as normal. In either case, shoddy items that gain the broken condition can never have that condition removed (even by using magic or if they later recover hit points) without further successful Craft checks and gp expenditure to fix the initial flaws.

			"The menacing, eyeless masks of the Hellknight signifers were first created by members of the Order of the Gate, and are semitransparent when viewed from the inside. This alchemical treating of the material obscures the face of the wearer as a full helm does but allows the wearer to see as if through a smoky pane of glass. When wearing a signifer mask, the wearer is always treated as averting her gaze when dealing with gaze attacks, and she gains a +8 circumstance bonus on saving throws against vision-based effects. However, the obscuring nature of the mask means that the wearer also takes a -4 penalty on vision-based Perception checks while wearing the mask, and all opponents are treated as having concealment (20% miss chance).",

Signifer masks are often magically enhanced, becoming variants of items that take up the head item slot. Additionally, when a character takes levels in the Hellknight signifer prestige class, this mask grants the benefits and capabilities of the signifer mask class feature (see page 93)."

The fungoid is carefully harvested, pierced at one end, hollowed out, and then injected with a strong alchemical adhesive that hardens to a fibrous material almost instantly when exposed to air. When squeezed, a spider sac's adhesive shoots out to a maximum range of 10 feet and sticks to whatever it strikes, whereupon the strand dries instantly into a durable fibrous rope. For the purposes of climbing, treat a spider sac as a grappling hook except that all surfaces are AC 5. A spider sac can also be used as a lasso except with AC 10, 4 hit points, and a DC 24 Strength check to burst. A spider sac is a single-use item.",

			"Created by dwarves after the Quest for Sky, this faintly glowing collection of minerals allows photosynthetic plants to grow in underground environments without sunlight. Sunsoil has since spread to a handful of agricultural communities throughout the Darklands, particularly among duergar plantations and svirfneblin enclaves. One pound of sunsoil covers a 20-footby- 20-foot area of regular earth and takes 1 minute to distribute evenly. A treated area allows plants to grow without sunlight for 4 months. Light-based spells and magical effects trigger an alchemical reaction in sunsoil. Any spell with the light descriptor cast on a pound of sunsoil causes all areas covered in the soil to be treated as areas of bright light for 1 round. This light counts as natural sunlight for creatures vulnerable to such effects. After being subjected to such an effect, sunsoil immediately becomes normal dirt."

			"While potion sponges are a reasonable enough method for air-breathers like undines to prepare to bring a potion underwater, aquatic creatures prefer a solution that allows them to prepare potions, beverages, and other liquids underwater to begin with. A sureseal bladder is made of a thin membrane that won't allow liquid through. By passing a solid spout or tube through the membrane, you can fill the bladder without allowing in any ambient seawater, and the membrane seals behind the spout. Once the bladder is full, the drinker can nip on the end of the membrane in order to sip the drink at her leisure, slowly crumpling the bladder for eventual disposal. The cheaper mundane sureseal bladders hold about 2 cups of liquid and work best for enjoying a favorite drink; the listed weight assumes the mundane sureseal bladder is full. Potions rely on drinking the entire dose, so potion sureseal bladders, while much smaller (just large enough for a potion), are pressurized in order to expel the entire potion at once without losing any of it, allowing the drinker to drink them as a standard action just like drinking a potion above the waves. Either type of sureseal bladder can be used only once."

Some of the larger or rarer creatures, such as whales, are obviously much more difficult to find on the open market, and may only be available in seedy underground bazaars.
