Simurghs prefer to keep to themselves, well out of the way of lesser creatures and their often dubious morals, though they can be relied upon for aid when called by those in true need and with a pure heart. A simurgh can live for thousands of years, and frequent mentions of these giant avian beings throughout a region's historical record are more often than not sightings of the same creature."

Creatures that succeed at a DC 13 Will save resist the effects of this aura, though they must attempt a new saving throw each time they use one of the listed skills in the area. This is a mind-affecting effect and the save DC is Wisdom-based.",
			"",
			"**Detect Alignment (Sp)** At will, a sin seeker can use detect chaos, detect evil, detect good, or detect law. Only one of these can be active at any given time.",
			"",
			"#### Description",
			"",
			"Believed to have been bred centuries ago by zealous priests and inquisitors, sin seekers are living creatures with a supernatural ability to detect the scent of varying degrees of morality. Originally small forest swine known for their acute senses of smell, these unfortunate creatures were subjected to a magical mutation similar in practice to fleshwarping. The priests' goal was to use these new creations to sniff out the supporters of rival faiths, identifying them by their hidden sins.",
			"",
			"In the centuries following their initial creation, various sects throughout Golarion maintained small sin seeker breeding programs. Many of these were aimed at culling impious members from the ranks of the clergy, though many evil sects used sin seekers as torture and interrogation aids. Today, small populations of sin seekers still survive in monasteries throughout Golarion, and adventurers of all alignments continue to keep them as familiars. Sin seekers are usually about 12 to 18 inches long, with a 2-foot wingspan. They weigh between 3 and 5 pounds.",
			"",
			"Centuries of selective breeding have improved the sin seekers' magical abilities, granting them the ability to sense other creatures' motives and alignments. They are capable of instantly sensing whether a creature is good or evil, and they also have a knack for tracking creatures by their auras. Once in close contact with a creature, sin seekers have a host of tools for discerning whether that creature is lying or manipulating information. In addition to the aura of honesty that surrounds them, each seeker has a small arsenal of spell-like abilities that help it glean the truth from weak-willed creatures.",
			"",
			"Though graced with an above-average intelligence, sin seekers are poor at handling logistics and practicalities. They make excellent judges of character, and easily pick up on subtle social cues that could indicate dishonesty. While sin seekers are able to draw distinctions between various motives, they have no inherent alignment, and don't place moral judgments on the information they gather. Like bloodhounds sniffing for a trail, sin seekers happily delve for information without regard for what it means. This moral ambivalence makes them equally useful for benevolent or malicious purposes.",
			"",
			"Sin seekers lack any natural instincts and rely entirely on reciprocal relationships with larger creatures for protection and sustenance. Sin seekers are omnivores who can survive on almost any kind of food, though they are healthiest when fed a vegetable-heavy diet. They can eat anything, but they're poor at regulating their own nutrition-if left to their own devices, sin seekers gorge themselves to the point of nausea, especially when offered rich, fatty foods. While they acclimate quickly to new cultures and eating habits, they are susceptible to unfamiliar diseases and poisons.",
			"",
			"Though sin seekers can be found throughout Golarion, they are best suited for the moderate climates of the Inner Sea region, northern Casmaron, and coastal Tian Xia. While their small frames are well padded by a layer of fat, they are mostly hairless and lack sufficient body mass to survive frigid temperatures for long. They fare no better in extreme heat, as they easily become dehydrated and are vulnerable to sunburn. Luckily, their susceptibility to the elements is counterbalanced by their suitability for indoor living. Despite their porcine aspect, they live cleanly, and can easily be trained to use lavatories. They have an inherent respect for personal space and are happiest when provided with a small nesting area to call their own. Sin seekers are quiet living companions, except during mating season, during which time they utter grotesque, mewling cries. In all, sin seekers are finicky creatures who require more upkeep than most animals, though their unique skill set makes them worth the extra effort.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"Sin seekers are wholly domestic creatures incapable of surviving long in the wild. Like any domestic animal, sin seekers are acclimated to humanoid contact, and integrate well into humanoid cultures. Though slightly repulsive in appearance, they are affectionate creatures with good social skills. Unfortunately, their inability to properly defend themselves and inability to regulate their eating make them high-maintenance travel companions, especially when contrasted with self-sufficient familiars like cats, monkeys, and rodents. Sin seekers are easy prey, and their sightlessness makes them especially vulnerable to quick predators such as hawks, wolves, and foxes. Sin seeker familiars require constant guardianship and physical protection.",
			"",
			"The difficulty of keeping such delicate creatures alive and healthy has often proven worth the trouble for religious sects throughout Golarion. While each sect breeds its sin seekers with different magical abilities, they all use the creatures as lie detectors and moral litmus tests. Clergy from good-aligned sects, like those that worship Iomedae or Sarenrae, often use sin seekers as penitential aids. These sects see sin seekers as living reminders of the priests' shortcomings and often use them to witness ritual oaths. Evil sects, like those that worship Norgorber or Asmodeus, often use sin seekers as interrogation and inquisitional instruments. Such sects combine the use of sin seekers with traditional torture techniques to persecute nonbelievers or to weed out seditious forces within their ranks.",
			"",
			"Once trained, sin seekers make excellent familiars, and form strong bonds with their keepers. They are both affectionate and loyal, and quickly adopt their keepers' personalities. Their high intelligence and lie-detecting abilities make them favored familiars of detectives, interrogators, and negotiators. Sin seekers' ability to track creatures by following their auras make them popular among rangers, paladins, and inquisitors who specialize in tracking evil creatures. Unfortunately, while sin seekers are incredibly useful, their auras of honesty and repulsive appearances can sometimes be a hindrance to adventuring parties. Charismatic rogues and bards find the creatures both off-putting and inconvenient. Any character of 5th level or higher with the Improved Familiar feat may take a sin seeker as a familiar.",
			"",
			"### Variant Sin Seekers",
			"",
			"While the description above represents the most common variant of sin seekers, some sects breed the creatures with abilities that more closely align with their religious aims. Sin seekers from good-aligned temples often have the ability to cast protection from evil instead of confess. Congregations that revile the undead sometimes breed their seekers to cast detect undead instead of zone of truth, or speak with dead instead of comprehend languages. Evil sects, meanwhile, sometimes breed into their sin seekers the ability to cast interrogation instead of seek thoughts, or touch of idiocy instead of comprehend languages."

			"",
			"**Envyspawn (+2 Str, -2 Cha):** Short and thin, envyspawn often become rangers.",
			"",
			"**Gluttonspawn (+2 Con, -2 Dex):** Obese yet hardy and strong, gluttonspawn often become fighters.",
			"",
			"**Greedspawn (+2 Dex, -2 Wis):** Towering over 7 feet in height, greedspawn have gold-tinged veins and often become rogues.",
			"",
			"**Lustspawn (+4 Cha, -2 Con, -2 Wis):** With perfectly formed bodies sitting in grotesque counterpoint to their monstrous faces and claws, lustspawn often become sorcerers.",
			"",
			"**Pridespawn (+4 Int, -2 Wis, -2 Cha):** Unique among sinspawn for their long manes of hair, pridespawn are near-skeletal in their gauntness. They often become wizards.",
			"",
			"**Slothspawn (+2 Wis, -2 Dex):** Thick rolls of excess skin drape a slothspawn's hunched frame. They often become clerics.",
			"",
			"**Wrathspawn:** These sinspawn use the statistics given above. They often become barbarians.",
			"",
			"### Advancements and Variants",
			"",
			"**Source** [Pathfinder #134: It Came from Hollow Mountain pg. 246](source/pathfinder_#134_it_came_from_hollow_mountain) Each runelord experimented with sinspawn, imbuing the sinspawn with the runelord's signature sin and developing other variants. Particularly cunning sinspawn often practice martial talents, advancing as [barbarians](class/barbarian), [fighters](class/fighter), or [rogues](class/rogue). As adaptable as humanoids, sinspawn with the proper training or tutelage (perhaps originating from ancient Thassilonian texts or meditation upon the arcane energies of a runewell) might advance in any class, although sinspawn [bards](class/bard), [druids](class/druid), and [hunters](class/hunter) are practically unheard of. The following list incorporates and expands upon the variant sinspawn above.",
			"",
			"**Aerial Sinspawn (+4 Dex, +2 Con, fly 60 ft. [good], CR +1):** Xanderghul, Runelord of Pride, believed his mighty sinspawn should soar above the heads of his enemies, though Earthfall cut short his experiments. Aerial pridespawn are therefore rare, lurking in the mountaintop ruins of Cyrusian, but are still far more common than aerial variants of other types of sinspawn.",
			"",
			"**Aquatic Sinspawn (swim 30 ft., aquatic subtype):** Not to be outdone on any battlefield, Runelord Alaznist developed wrathspawn with gills and webbed hands and feet to serve as marines. Belimarius and Sorshen followed suit, breeding aquatic envyspawn and lustspawn respectively to guard their domains' watery borders. Other types of aquatic sinspawn are rare.",
			"",
			"**Envyspawn (+2 Str, -2 Cha):** Short and slight, envyspawn are compelled to hunt and spy upon their enemies. They obsess over comparing their enemies' possessions and prowess to their own. Envyspawn often become [rangers](class/ranger) or [slayers](class/slayer).",
			"",
			"**Fleshdregs:** Products of malfunctioning runewells, botched rituals, and the like, [fleshdregs](unknown/fleshdregs) are squat, half-formed sinspawn, little more than a mouth on legs. Nevertheless, their sinful bites can mangle the bodies and minds of their enemies, and sinspawn treat fleshdregs as guard animals or pets. Faulty runewells may even spit out wads of hungry flesh known as [fleshdreg swarms](unknown/fleshdreg_swarms).",
			"",
			"**Gluttonspawn (+2 Con, -2 Dex):** Hardy despite their obesity, gluttonspawn often become [fighters](class/fighter). A few rare individuals become [alchemists](class/alchemist), gorging themselves on the mutagens they concoct.",
			"",
			"**Greedspawn (+2 Dex -2 Wis): Standing 7 feet high with glittering, gold-tinted veins, greedspawn usually become [rogues](class/rogue), but some focus their avarice into objects they hoard and become [occultists](class/occultist).",
			"",
			"**Lustspawn (+4 Cha, -2 Con, -2 Wis):** These sinspawn sport perfectly formed male and female bodies that stand in odd contrast to their horrific faces, claws, and legs. Unlike their pallid kin, lustspawn often have brightly colored hides. Capable of intercourse but not procreation, lustspawn indulge themselves at every opportunity. Many lustspawn become [sorcerers](class/sorcerer) or [mesmerists](class/mesmerist), though sinspawn [enchanters](class/wizard) and [witches](class/witch) are not unknown.",
			"",
			"**Pridespawn (+4 Int, -2 Wis, -2 Cha):** The near-skeletal pridespawn are proud of their thick manes of hair, which they alone of any sinspawn can grow. They often become [Wizards](class/wizard), although pridespawn [magi](class/magus) and [psychics](class/psychic) are not unknown.",
			"",
			"**Slothspawn (+2 Wis, -2 Dex):** Slothspawn appear weighed down by cloaks of excess skin, yet they scuttle about on shrunken legs with alarming speed. They often become [clerics](class/cleric) or [warpriests](class/warpriest), venerating [Lamashtu](faith/lamashtu), [Rovagug](faith/rovagug), or whichever locally popular demon lord demands the least effort. Slothspawn [conjurers](class/wizard) and [Summoners](class/wizard) prefer to let their summoned creatures labor on their behalf.",
			"",
			"**Wrathspawn:** The original creations of Alaznist, the bloodthirsty wrathspawn are the most common variety of sinspawn. Many become [barbarians](class/barbarian), [brawlers](class/brawler), or [fighters](class/fighter). Exceptional wrathspawn tap into the essence of sin inside them and become [bloodragers](class/bloodrager) instead."

Sirens always live near the sea, where their powerful voices can carry over the waves and attract the attention of unwary sailors who trespass near their isles.",

			"Formed from the fabric of the Ethereal Plane, sishkansets are incorporeal reflections of mortal psyches. Born of the disorientation and despair of souls whose mortal vessels died isolated and buffeted by wilderness winds, sishkansets haunt sparsely settled frontiers. They wield the same winds that tormented their progenitors in their final moments; a sishkanset's presence disrupts the atmosphere for miles around, and though the natural winds they stoke are not inherently dangerous, they are maddeningly constant.",
			"",
			"Sishkansets sift through mortal thoughts in the hope of reassembling their own fragmented personalities, but their fundamentally incomplete nature makes this an unattainable goal. When a sishkanset's suffering becomes overwhelming, it visits its condition on others, slowly driving its victims insane through unending wind and discordant whispers.",
			"",

			"",
			"A sishkanset is about 8 feet tall and unnaturally thin.",
			"",
			"Sishkansets' progenitors are those who perish in the wilderness, lost and utterly alone with only endless, mocking winds to usher their spirits from their bodies. Such souls carry enough despair that their passage through the Ethereal Plane leaves a psychic impression. Powerful negative emotions whip the plane's mutable substance into a roiling frenzy that eventually coalesces into a sishkanset. The creature maintains only a fraction of the mortal being's personality, culled from its last moments of disorientation, isolation, and desperate search for comfort and safety. The creature finds itself inexorably drawn to the Material Plane, where it seeks what its progenitor could not find in life.",
			"",
			"Sishkansets most often dwell in sparsely populated frontier areas, border towns, and isolated homesteads. They are drawn toward landmarks that could have guided their progenitors to safety, twining their unnaturally tall frames around flagpoles, steeples, weather vanes, and other high places that allow an unfettered view of their surroundings. From such heights, they reach along the unnatural air currents they produce to sieve the minds of passersby.",
			"",
			"A sishkanset clutches the emotions it pulls from these studied thoughts, hoping to fill the gaps in its persona, but its fundamentally fragmented nature means it will never achieve this goal. Over time, these tantalizing glimpses of mortal life drive the creature to frustrated despair. It relieves this torment by visiting its condition on others, wrapping its victims in winds that carry its anguished ramblings. Driving an individual to insanity soothes the sishkanset for a time, but its sense of fulfillment eventually fades.",
			"",
			"Sishkansets fly against their assailants when aggressively confronted, wreathing themselves in restless currents and disrupting their opponents' minds with mental assaults and disorienting blasts of icy wind. Sishkansets that are banished rather than physically destroyed develop a focused hatred of their banishers. Sishkansets lack any inherent means of traversing planar boundaries, but they wait, howling their wrath into the void, until an unwitting extradimensional traveler creates a means by which the sishkansets can return to the Material Plane and pursue their targets.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"Sishkansets are an infrequent menace and are often mistaken for incorporeal undead. They enter a keening frenzy in response to attempts to banish them with positive energy or similar means' such displays of faith are a reminder of mortal experiences forever lost.",
			"",
			"Though their minds are fractured and their trains of thought mercurial, sishkansets are reasonably intelligent. Their fruitless attempts to fulfill themselves with the thoughts of others means they know much about the communities they haunt. Sishkansets relieved by recently driving a victim insane can sometimes even be engaged in conversation. Their erratic desires often include requests for mortals to describe their lives and feelings. Individuals who are able to parse these demands from a sishkanset's ceaseless, whispering stream of consciousness and indulge the creature can sometimes ask for information in return, though they are wise to leave before the sishkanset fixates on them.",
			"",
			"Objects bearing strong emotional impressions intrigue sishkansets. They hover over the psychically charged items, rambling about the memento's past like an academy's lecturer. Eventually, however, the creatures' inability to interact with objects or incorporate the emotions they store rekindles their existential anguish."

Most evil siyokoys dwell in such lightless, forgotten reaches of the world's oceans.",
			"",
			"Regardless of where they dwell, siyokoys adore shipwrecks and long-forgotten ruins claimed by the oceans. Exploring these relics and recovering strange and wondrous treasures is what most siyokoys live for, and a siyokoy's lair is often decorated with the results of these scavenging expeditions to sunken ships and flooded cities. Strangely, siyokoys avoid making their lairs amid such ruins, mostly out of a strange superstition the creatures share about these areas-it is not lucky, say siyokoys, to sleep in a place where air breathing creatures have drowned.",

Rules for crafting traps can be found [here](rule/traps), and examples of traps typically built by skaprauns are provided below.",
			"",
			"#### Description",
			"",
			"Because of their mighty horns, cloven hooves, and aggressively territorial behavior, skaprauns are often mistaken for hellspawn or other minions of evil. Although these fey actually have a deep sense of honor, even those who know them for what they are generally view them with suspicion-their stubbornness and isolationist traditions leave little room for alliances or friendships with other creatures. Skaprauns stand 3-1/2 feet tall and weigh 60 pounds.",
			"",
			"### Ecology",
			"",
			"Much like the animals that they resemble, skaprauns have beards, short tails, and long, curved horns. Their fur has a fine, woolly layer and a longer layer of hollow guard hairs, offering protection against wind and cold temperatures. Their feet have inner pads and sharp dewclaws to prevent slipping, and their cloven hooves can spread apart to ensure a better grip on uneven surfaces.",
			"",
			"Skaprauns are mainly herbivorous, but they supplement their diet with meat from animals they hunt and with clay to obtain minerals. They eat animals primarily for ritualistic purposes rather than out of necessity. Their main purposes for hunting are to maintain balanced animal populations within their territory, to obtain raw materials such as bone and sinew for building tools and weapons, and to hone their combat tactics.",
			"",
			"Although skaprauns have mortal lifespans averaging 18 years, they are in a sense immortal. The death of a skapraun triggers a form of reincarnation that occurs inside the body of the dead skapraun. The new skapraun leeches proteins and other nutrients from its precursor's body to build its own. When the newborn skapraun crawls out-a process that takes roughly 4 weeks-only a withered, fragile husk remains of the precursor's body. The horns of the precursor remain fully intact, however.",
			"",
			"A newborn skapraun is hairless, hornless, and nearly helpless, but it learns to walk within 5 minutes of its birth. The skapraun remembers nothing of its former life, but it instinctively knows to collect the horns of its precursor and protect them at all costs so it can later build a bow from them. A skapraun usually reaches full maturity within 2 months of its birth, but it may take longer if the precursor's body was badly damaged.",
			"",
			"A skapraun is not identical to the one from which it was born, but its psyche and physique are always shaped in some way by the decisions its precursor made-and particularly by how the precursor met its end.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"Skaprauns make their homes in rocky, mountainous areas where their physique gives them a distinct advantage over less agile beings. They live almost exclusively above the treeline, where their enemies have less of a chance to find shelter from their arrows. However, the territory of a skapraun tribe extends far below the treeline; the creatures hunt and gather plants and other resources in these lower regions.",
			"",
			"To skaprauns, the concept of holding the higher ground is a central cultural aspect and a matter of great pride, and it also makes them fiercely territorial. They often do not allow any other intelligent beings to inhabit a higher location on the same mountain and do not tolerate intruders near their homes, even travelers who just passing through. However, skaprauns do not usually resort to violence unless stern warnings fail to remove the threat.",
			"",
			"While the inhospitable terrain skaprauns live in is enough to keep most intruders away, they take great care to fortify the slopes of their mountain homes against attacks. They build traps in natural choke points and prepare many defensive fighting positions from which they can shower any attacker with a rain of arrows. The defensive positions have rocks piled as low walls, camouflaged to look like naturally occurring piles of rubble. These are usually difficult to reach from below, but if the enemies are particularly mobile, the skapraun sentries retreat into another defensive position farther up the mountain rather than risking a melee that may go against them.",
			"",
			"When a tribe of skaprauns ends up in a prolonged conflict, the fey also employ offensive tactics that mostly involve quick hit-and-run attacks or feigned retreats in order to lead the enemy into an ambush. They also study weather patterns and use the treacherous mists of the mountains to their advantage, advancing when the mists rise and retreating when they recede.",
			"",
			"Skapraun chieftains are born from the deaths of heroic individuals. The chieftains often have unusual physical traits that marks their births, such as very large horns, snow-white fur, or a greater stature. Skapraun leaders often take class levels in barbarian, druid, hunter, oracle, ranger, or shaman.",
			"",
			"The birth of twins is considered a very auspicious sign in skapraun society. It is the only way in which a skapraun tribe can grow, and the twins are often uniquely gifted with oracular powers. Each inherits one of the precursor's horns and builds a spear instead of the usual recurve bow. These twin-oracles often speak in unison and seem to share a single mind. Any later generations born of the twin-oracles are usually normal skaprauns, however.",
			"",
			"On the bottom rung of skapraun society are arkas-outcasts who are allowed to perform only the most menial tasks within a tribe. A skapraun becomes an arka if it loses and cannot recover its weapon. Similarly, a skapraun who for some reason cannot extract its precursor's horns or make a weapon out of them is marked an arka. Rather than facing the shame of not being considered a warrior, it is common for an arka to go on a self-imposed exile. Over time, these lone skaprauns lose their supernatural connection to nature, including their ability to reincarnate. They may find themselves in the company of humanoid creatures, getting along best with dwarves, perhaps because of dwarves' similarly dour dispositions and love of mountains.",

			"- Hide: The skeltercat's hide bristles like that of an angry cat and grows thicker, increasing its natural armor bonus by 2.",
			"- Legs: The skeltercat grows an additional pair of legs, bringing its total to six, increasing its base land speed to 60 feet, and granting it the rake special ability. The rake attacks use the same damage and critical threat range as the skeltercat's normal claw attacks.",

All creatures in that area must succeed at a DC 13 Will save or become panicked for 1d4 rounds. This is a sonic, mind-affecting fear effect. A creature that successfully saves against this effect can't be affected by the same skeltercat's scream for 24 hours. The save DC is Charisma-based.",
			"",
			"#### Description",
			"",
			"For a long time, many experts believed the creature now known as the skeltercat existed only in the folklore of the Shoanti tribes or in the far-fetched tales of a few wild-eyed travelers. Only with the recent reopening of the Bloodsworn Vale have rumors of the skeltercat's existence been taken seriously. As traffic through the vale increases, reports of attacks by strange, shapeshifting cats are growing startlingly commonplace. Such tales are told most frequently in the fortress city of Skelt, a common stopover for merchants traveling through the Bloodsworn Vale. The stories out of Skelt gave these creatures their name.",
			"",
			"The skeltercat resembles a heavily muscled cougar or mountain lion, having a tawny coat, powerful paws with retractable claws, and strong hind legs that allow it to jump great distances. It primarily walks about on all fours, adopting an oddly hunched posture that distinguishes it from normal cats. When faced with a threat, a skeltercat rises onto its hind legs, walking upright in a disturbingly human fashion. An adult skeltercat stands just shy of 8 feet tall when fully upright, and weighs up to 300 pounds.",
			"",
			"Many generations ago, a small band of Shoanti warriors lived high in the Mindspin Mountains near the headwaters of the Yondabakari River. This band, whose name is now long lost, were the first to feel the bite of Chelish steel as the southerners began their push into Varisia. These Shoanti fought back against the invaders as best they could, but they had no shaman in their group, and soon found they were no match for Chelish magic. Though they begged the clans of the lowlands to train them in such arts, they were repeatedly refused. No clan wanted to share its secrets with the notorious raiders of the mountain tribe, and none yet realized the threat the Chelish invasion would soon pose.",
			"",
			"As a desperate ploy, members of the mountain tribe stole down into the lowlands to spy on the druids and shamans of the other tribes, hoping to steal the secrets of the magic they had been denied. These spies observed a druid from the lowlands wildshaping herself into a mountain lion, and having listened carefully to the magic incantations she used, they returned to tell the tribe what they had found. Whether by chance or fate, the incantations worked, and soon the whole tribe had become fearsome cougars, just as the druid had. Only too late did they realize their spies had not learned how to reverse the transformation. Try as they might, they were able to become only partly human. Trapped somewhere between human and cat forms, the members of this reclusive mountain tribe were cursed to become the first skeltercats.",
			"",
			"Though created by a magical accident, skeltercats breed true, and a skeltercat that mates with a normal cougar invariably produces skeltercat offspring. Much like mountain lions, skeltercats are carnivores, though unlike mundane cats, they display a distinct preference for humanoid prey. Though skeltercats will attack any humanoid, they appear to prefer Chelish flesh to any other, perhaps due to some ancestral memory of the original skeltercats' conflicts with Chelish invaders. Skeltercats live slightly longer than normal cougars, having an average lifespan of 30 to 40 years.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"Although skeltercats live throughout the Mindspin Mountains, they are especially concentrated in the Bloodsworn Vale. Outside of the vale, skeltercats are most often found in and around hill giant camps. The brutish giants admire the skeltercats' savage ferocity, and often share their food with the cats to encourage them to remain in the area. For their part, the cats keep the area surrounding the giants' camp free from lesser predators and pick off any creatures attempting to escape the giants' clutches. Skeltercats may also serve as guards for the giants as they sleep through the night, and the last thing a group of adventurers may hear when attempting to ambush a band of giants is the yowl of a pouncing skeltercat.",
			"",
			"The Shoanti have a complicated relationship with skeltercats. Though many Shoanti tribespeople have lost their lives to the shapeshifters' claws, the Shoanti nonetheless insist that skeltercats act as guardians for their people. An obscure Shoanti myth holds that the first skeltercat was once a Shoanti warrior who wished to defend her tribe from a demon that inflicted terrible madness upon its foes. Seeking a way to protect herself from the demon's insanity-inducing gaze, the warrior donned a magical cougar mask created by the shaman of her tribe. The mask worked, and the warrior was able to drive the demon away. However, she discovered too late that she could not remove the mask, and she was cursed to forever roam the land in the form of a fearsome mountain lion.",
			"",
			"Though this myth is just a mangled retelling of the skeltercat's true origins, there may be some truth to it. Skeltercats are inherently immune to madness and confusion effects, and some claim that those who wear the hide of a skeltercat can gain some measure of this immunity for themselves."

			"**Adaptive Attachment (Ex)** When a skincrawler successfully attaches itself to a creature, it swiftly adapts its coloration and texture to match the creature's flesh. Doing so heals any damage it caused with the sting attack it used to attach to the host. When it uses its freeze ability in conjunction with this, it can take 20 on Stealth checks to remain hidden-in most cases, this means a successful DC 27 Perception check is required to spot a skincrawler attached to a creature. A skincrawler cannot duplicate fur or scales, thus all Perception checks to spot the attached skincrawler on such a host automatically succeed.",
			"",
			"**Memory Lapse (Su)** A target struck by a skincrawler's sting must succeed at a DC 15 Will save or become momentarily befuddled and unaware of its surroundings. This condition does not last long enough for other creatures to take advantage of the victim's disoriented state of mind, but is long enough for the ooze to attach itself to the target. The affected creature retains no memory of the skincrawler's sting attack or of the creature attaching to its body. It perceives sensations through the attached ooze as if the ooze were part of its own skin. The save DC is Constitution-based.",
			"",
			"**Siphon Vitality (Ex)** Once a skincrawler is attached to a host, it slowly feeds on the victim's fluids. This deals 1 point of Constitution damage per day. Since a night's rest is enough to heal this damage, the host of a skincrawler can continue to function relatively normally; however, a creature with a skincrawler attached to its body in this manner takes a -2 penalty on all saving throws against effects that cause exhaustion and fatigue. Furthermore, the host suffers from mild headaches, slightly blurred vision, a nagging feeling of being watched, and other minor but discomforting distractions that impart a -1 penalty on all Will saving throws and Wisdom-based skill checks. All of these effects (the Constitution damage and the penalties on checks and saves) stack when multiple skincrawlers feed on a single host.",
			"",
			"#### Description",
			"",
			"Skincrawlers are parasitic oozes that feed on the fluids of living hosts. They stalk isolated prey, but due to their mindlessness, skincrawlers do not recognize that feeding on a host already infested by other skincrawlers can swiftly shorten the lifespan of their food source.",
			"",
			"When a skincrawler's host dies, the ooze detaches and crawls into the host's body through a convenient orifice, whereupon it enters the last stages of its life cycle. As the host decays around it, the skincrawler suffuses the host's flesh; 24 hours after the host's death, the host's skin splits apart into a rash of up to a dozen skincrawlers that then slither away to seek new prey. When unattached to a host, a skincrawler appears to be a protoplasmic blob of flesh with visible veins and capillaries.",

The skittergoats have adapted to life alongside the ankhegs with whom they share their environment: their agility allows them to slip through small spaces in search of eggs, and their speed makes them quite adept at escaping the grasp of angry ankheg mothers. Their relatively docile nature and ability to pierce ankheg eggs with their sharp horns have led to high demand for domesticated skittergoat companions among rangers searching for ankheg nests.",
			"",
			"Skittergoats don't often form large herds, since foraging for ankheg eggs is most effectively done alone.

Mothers regurgitate food for their young after returning from a hunt."

Instead, they view their dishonorable behaviors as the most expedient method of survival. They hate most other humanoids, viewing them as lazy and foolish, and think nothing of sneaking into a home, killing all the residents, and burglarizing what they can carry off without getting caught.",
			"",
			"Skulks travel in small groups, rarely forming tribes of more than 16, for in larger groups bickering quickly leads to violent infighting. Murder between skulks is not uncommon, but they understand safety in numbers, and most frown upon treason within a group that is already relatively small, punishing traitors with a quick death. When possible, they set up camps in discreet spots near other settlements, commonly inhabiting sewers, caves, or forests-though their unsavory, murderous tactics often force them to relocate before local law enforcement, quickly alerted to their presence once the remains of a family of victims are discovered, finds them.",
			"",
			"Skulks are roughly the same size as a human, averaging 6 feet tall, though they are significantly more gangly and nimble, and commonly weigh only 140 pounds. Skinny arms and legs help them sneak around obstacles and squeeze into narrow spaces. Skulks can live up to 50 years, though most die from violence long before that. Although skulks have racial Hit Dice, they generally advance in power by taking class levels. Rogue is a favorite choice among skulks, for their natural abilities at stealth and sneak attacks fit well with this choice, but they also excel in the roles of clerics, fighters and rangers who specialize in ranged weapons, and rarely as wizards (particularly illusionists)."

Skum have even lost their own name-only the most erudite and wise of their kind remember that they were once known as the ulat-kini. Today, most identify themselves with the racial epithet applied to them by surface-dwellers-\"skum.\"",
			"",
			"Skum do not age, and barring death by violence or disease, they can live forever. Unfortunately, this near immortality is crippled by the fact that skum are incapable of reproducing among themselves, for all skum are male. The aboleths did not want their slave race to prosper without their permission. Yet terribly, this does not mean that skum cannot breed. Originally created from human stock, skum can impregnate humans, and the children issued from such unholy unions are invariably deformed. Those who are not born skum undergo gradual transformations throughout their lives, and when they would normally die of old age, such hybrids instead go through \"the change,\" shedding their wrinkled flesh and transforming into one of the ulat-kini. While most skum tribes lack the drive to perpetuate their race and would prefer to languish in their hideous sunken ruins, tribes settling offshore of remotely populated coastlines seem to be on the rise. Some such communities raid villages for breeding stock, but a few more insidious tribes form alliances with these desperate folk, providing protection and bounty from the sea in return for wives."

			"A combination of hare and grouse, skvaders boast features and mannerisms of both animals. At first glance, a skvader appears to be a common hare, though its shorter ears distinguish it from the longer-eared rabbits. Its wings, hindquarters, and tail usually have a coloration similar to its fur, and its birdlike features are only easily distinguishable up close. Skvaders are twitchy and nervous, constantly on the lookout for predators. They switch between standing stock still upon sensing danger and quickly bolting to escape. While generally docile, skvaders become dangerous if cornered.",
			"",
			"A skvader is about 1-1/2 feet long and weighs around 10 pounds.",
			"",
			"Skvaders live primarily in temperate forests, though they are also found in hillier regions with enough vegetation to provide them easy sustenance. They're also drawn to open, low-lying areas, particularly farm fields and plains covered in an abundance of tall grasses upon which they can feed.",
			"",
			"Their high metabolisms give these herbivores voracious appetites, which force them to consume such large quantities of plants that they pose significant threats to farmers' livelihoods. A family of skvaders infesting a farmer's fields can lay waste to his crops in just a couple of weeks. Once they've destroyed the vegetation in an area, the skvaders move on to nearby farms and continue feeding.",
			"",
			"If cornered, a skvader emits a shrill screech that can be heard as far as a mile away. Other skvaders in the area immediately rush to its aid, causing a confrontation with a lone skvader to quickly escalate into a fight with a ferocious group of the creatures. When in combat, a skvader prefers to single out a threat and attach itself to that target.",
			"",
			"Scholars postulate that skvaders are a lesser form of their wolpertinger cousins, a variant that never fully developed into the greater threat the wolpertinger is. Others believe that the skvader is a distant precursor to the owlbear, citing the combination of mammalian and avian features, though on a much smaller scale. These scholars believe skvaders might have been an early experiment to combine two creatures into one, undertaken by the same lunatic wizard who supposedly created the owlbear.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"To protect themselves and secure a safe birthing environment, skvaders often dig small burrows. A large enough skvader population frightens off other small herbivores, which leave their burrows behind for the skvaders to claim. They sometimes have to spend some time expanding the burrow's size, particularly if one or more wolpertingers are among the pack.",
			"",
			"In skvader families, adult females care for the young and the males dig the burrows, patrol for predators, and offer protection when their mates deliver a litter. Skvaders mate for life, though if one of a mated pair dies, the other seeks a new mate after a mourning period. Skvader young often stay with their parents for the first year of life. Multiple skvader families in the same region generally coexist peacefully. If one family grows significantly larger than the others, the smaller family simply moves on to new feeding grounds.",
			"",
			"### Skvaders and Wolpertingers as Familiars",
			"",
			"While most skvaders and wolpertingers prefer the company of their families and packs, occasionally the more adventurous among them come to serve as familiars. Service to a powerful spellcaster brings with it protection and long-term companionship, which these creatures take advantage of. A neutral spellcaster can gain a skvader as a familiar at 3rd level by taking the Improved Familiar feat, and a neutral spellcaster can gain a wolpertinger as a familiar at 5th level by taking the Improved Familiar feat."

			"Slime molds are revolting oozes that wallow in rot and decay. A perfect example of symbiosis, each slime mold is covered in a thick garden of fungi, mildew, and toadstools, which helps it blend in with the surroundings. As ambush hunters, they can lie silently in wait for days at a time, surging into frenzied movement as soon as prey comes within reach. Most commonly encountered in deep forests, variations have adapted to life in caverns and sewers as well. They lack any ability to digest food, and rely entirely on their symbiotic fungal gardens to break down any organic matter they find into easily absorbed compost and decay. The molds and mushrooms that coat the ooze in turn receive ample food supplies, and over countless generations, many have developed into deadly variations of the forest or cave fungi from which they evolved. This fungal breakdown is in many ways akin to a disease-known as fungal rot, it can kill if allowed to progress for long. Those who succumb to fungal rot become tired and listless. Eventually, paralysis sets in and the victim's flesh begins to blacken and decay, running from the body in liquid streams that the slime mold can easily absorb. In a somewhat nauseating turnabout, certain creatures find the unusual fungus that grows upon a slime mold to be quite tasty, and these creatures actively hunt slime molds to devour their gardens-although they take care to avoid actual contact with the mold itself unless they happen to be immune to disease.",
			"",
			"Slime molds are ovoid in shape, growing up to 12 feet in length and weighing more than 600 pounds. Their substance is normally a sickly greenish-brown, with the coloration varying depending on their environment and how recently they've fed. They instinctually keep their coating of fungus and other vegetable detritus exposed above them, granting the slime mold a distinctive, undulating gait rather than the fluid movement of most oozes.",
			"",
			"To reproduce, slime molds split off small patches of their bodies whenever they encounter thick beds of fungi or mold. Over several months, these tiny blobs acclimate to the rot and absorb each another, until a single slime mold (with the young creature simple template) sprouts its own garden and begins hunting live prey."

			"**Breach Sense (Su)** A slithering pit can detect the presence and location of extradimensional spaces within the range of its blindsense, including those created by magic items like bags of holding, handy haversacks, and portable holes, as well as spell effects such as mage's magnificent mansion and rope trick. This ability also allows slithering pits to detect others of their kind.",
			"",
			"**Breach Vulnerability (Su)** If a slithering pit consumes an extradimensional space, such as one created by a bag of holding, a handy haversack, or a portable hole, the competing energies cause violent spasms that deal 2d6 points of damage to the slithering pit each round it contains the item. If killed in this way, the slithering pit explodes; anything trapped within the ooze takes 2d6 points of damage and is ejected to a random empty space within 30 feet of the slithering pit.",
			"",
			"**Pit (Su)** As a standard action, a slithering pit can cause its surface to open into an extradimensional space in order to capture and digest food. A slithering pit can use this ability only while on a solid horizontal surface of sufficient size to support it. The extradimensional space created by this ability is 10 feet deep, and any Medium or smaller creatures stepping into its space must succeed at a DC 15 Reflex save or fall into the pit, taking 1d6 points of damage from the fall. A slithering pit can also actively try to trap creatures by moving into their space. A target of this attack can make an attack of opportunity, but immediately falls into the extradimensional space following the attack. If the target forgoes this attack of opportunity, it can attempt a Reflex save to avoid falling into the extradimensional space as if it had wandered into the slithering pit's space. At any one time, a slithering pit can contain up to one Medium creature, two Small creatures, or four Tiny creatures. The save DC is Constitution-based. The interior surface of the pit is as hard as rough stone. While the pit is open, a creature inside can climb out with a successful DC 15 Climb check. A slithering pit can close its extradimensional space as a move action, trapping a creature inside. A trapped creature takes 1 point of acid damage each round it remains in the extradimensional space. A creature thus trapped can attack the walls of the space to damage the slithering pit. The walls have an AC of 10 and hardness 8. A slithering pit can forcibly eject the contents of its extradimensional space as a standard action, dealing 1d6 points of damage to creatures inside. Ejected creatures end up in a random square adjacent to the slithering pit. If a slithering pit is killed, its extradimensional space collapses and ejects its contents immediately.",
			"",
			"**Transparent (Ex)** A slithering pit is difficult to discern from its surroundings in most environments. The slithering pit gains a +8 racial bonus on Stealth checks and can move at full speed without taking a penalty on Stealth checks. A creature that fails to notice a slithering pit and walks into it risks falling into its pit (if its pit is open) or taking damage as if struck by the slithering pit's tentacle attack.",
			"",
			"#### Description",
			"",
			"Bizarre oozes born from magical mishaps, slithering pits use their naturally occurring extradimensional spaces to attack and trap prey. An extradimensional breach coats the top surface of these oozes, and the creatures prowl lazily, hunting for well-traveled routes and then quietly lying down for hours-or even days-until tasty morsels literally fall into their waiting grasps. Like most oozes, slithering pits lack true mouths and any digestive organs. While they can trap creatures within their extradimensional wells, they must wait for their prey to dissolve in digestive acids before they can absorb any nutrition. Luckily, slithering pits can survive for weeks between feedings, and in lean times they can even hibernate for months, appearing to be nothing but a slick spot in an alleyway or a shallow puddle.",
			"",
			"Slithering pits frequent ruins and neglected urban areas, where their transparency allows them to blend in with the shadows of darkened alleys and crumbling corridors. No thicker than a few inches at the center, slithering pits are difficult to distinguish from natural features when immobile. Their slimy exteriors pick up debris and rubble as they stalk, further helping them blend into city streets and ruined floors. Beyond their mobility and slight thickness, slithering pits' only revealing feature is their shiny mucus, which leaves a glistening trail wherever the creatures travel-but even this dries up and flakes away in a few hours once the ooze settles in at a favored ambush site. While slithering pits are camouflaged on top, their undersides reveal their true appearance: moist and decorated in scintillating patterns of red, green, and blue. Slithering pits are 5 feet in diameter and weigh less than 20 pounds.",
			"",
			"As ambush predators, slithering pits are most successful when inactive. Because of their transparent appearances, most slithering pits are hardly noticed or are mistaken for shallow puddles by locals. When periods between feedings grow too long, the oozes become more aggressive. Despite their usually patient tactics, slithering pits become vicious when hungry or threatened, lashing out with a thin pseudopod from their perimeter. When desperate, they dispense with stealth and attempt to drag prey into their maws or throw themselves beneath stumbling feet. The fall into the pit is often enough to kill their prey; those who survive the fall instead die from being slowly digested if they can't quickly clamber back out. These creatures even show rudimentary strategy, sometimes trapping a child or small animal, whose cries for help eventually draw larger victims.",
			"",
			"A slithering pit's inner well functions much like a bag of holding, allowing it to carry more prey than its small body could normally contain and potentially feeding it for months after a good hunting season. Anyone or anything inside moves along with the ooze wherever it travels without any sense of outside momentum.",
			"",
			"A slithering pit can sometimes come into existence when an intelligent ooze-in most cases, a slithering tracker-consumes a bag of holding or another magic item that makes use of extradimensional spaces. The residual magical energies are infused within the ooze, and when it dies, the ooze's remaining material is reborn as a slithering pit.",
			"",
			"Slithering pits become dangerous urban blights as they prowl congested cities and cramped slums. They especially flourish in decaying or neglected areas, where potholes filled with water are overlooked. In areas plagued by crime, slithering pits are sometimes used to dispose of bodies. Some clever and opportunistic creatures' especially those immune to the pit's digestive acids-sometimes use slithering pits as roaming lairs, dragging their own kills into the oozes' cave-like interiors to share leftovers, and scavenging the freely available prey that the oozes trap. Some spellcasters consider the mucus of a slithering pit to be an ideal component for magic concerned with interdimensional travel and storage.",
			"",
			"Those researching these oozes claim that there are different varieties of slithering pits. Scattered reports exist of slithering pits that are much larger, sometimes stretching across an entire narrow street or setting up an ambush in the opening of a wide alley. Some lurk within the darkened expanses of warehouses or beneath boardwalks in dockside settlements. Scholars are unclear whether these larger oozes are simply regular slithering pits that have fed and lived long enough to grow, or if they form when larger oozes consume more powerful magic items.",
			"",
			"### Slithering Rift",
			"",
			"The most dangerous variant slithering pit is the slithering rift, an ooze that not only traps its prey in an extradimensional space, but also has the ability to serve as a wandering portal that can transport its prey across great distances-maybe even across the barriers of the planes themselves. Slithering rifts are much more powerful than the typical slithering pit-they are Huge, have 16 Hit Dice, and can manifest four tentacles per round to attack foes. A slithering rift's interaction with reality creates a significant warping of space, granting it a +20 deflection bonus to its AC. These powerful and dangerous oozes are CR 14 terrors."

			"An alien inhabitant of the dark underworld, the slithering tracker is a glistening creature of transparent ooze, typically about 3 inches thick and at least 3 feet in diameter. When still, it looks like a wet patch of stone or a patch of condensation on a wall. Comparatively slow moving, the slithering tracker relies on its transparency and knack for ambushing to surprise prey.",
			"",
			"Once a slithering tracker has paralyzed a living creature, it flows over an exposed patch of flesh, grabbing on and draining blood from the victim. A slithering tracker can drain a human-sized creature of its blood with shocking swiftness, leaving only a desiccated carcass behind. A slithering tracker can go some time between meals, but never turns down easy prey. The larger a slithering tracker grows, the more voracious its appetite becomes, until, after a particularly large feeding, the creature splits into two smaller slithering trackers that eventually go their separate ways in search of feeding territory.",
			"",
			"Slithering trackers are not harmed by bright light, but still prefer to avoid areas of intense illumination or natural sunlight, and so only venture aboveground at night. They prefer the cool, damp environment of their native caves and tunnels.",
			"",
			"Although intelligent and cunning, slithering trackers are entirely alien creatures. They do not possess any language of their own, although they can usually understand the dominant language of the region they dwell in-usually Undercommon. Some underworld inhabitants do manage to forge alliances with slithering trackers, or at least exist with them in symbiosis by providing the creatures with easy and regular prey, but as one can never truly know a slithering tracker's desires or motivations, such alliances are dangerous to rely upon."

			"",
			"Slurks are carnivores and have a formidable bite, thanks to their massive tusks. Their true strength, however, lies in their foul-smelling and unnatural secretions. The mucus exuded from the slurk's back is incredibly sticky and quickly hardens into a powerful resin, a quality the creature turns to its advantage by squirting it at intruders and then waiting for it to harden before closing for the kill. At the same time, the liquid excreted by glands on a slurk's stomach is incredible slippery, allowing the slurk to keep from being immobilized by its own back slime and also making it extremely hard to grapple or maneuver without its consent. Combined with slurks' natural ability to climb walls and hang from ceilings with ease, these abilities make the foul-smelling creatures extremely desirable to kobolds, who domesticate and train the frog-beasts as powerful mounts and guardians."

It cannot make other attacks during a round in which it engulfs a creature. A targeted creature can make an attack of opportunity against the smoke sentinel, but if it does so, it is not entitled to a saving throw against the engulf attack. A creature that does not make an attack of opportunity can attempt a DC 21 Reflex saving throw to avoid being engulfed; on a success, it is pushed back or aside (target's choice) as the smoke sentinel moves forward. An engulfed creature takes 1d6 points of Wisdom damage at the start of its turn each round it remains within the smoke sentinel's space. The save DC is Dexterity-based and includes a +2 racial bonus.",
			"",
			"**Gaseous (Ex)** A smoke sentinel can pass through small holes and even cracks without reducing its speed. It cannot enter water or other liquids. It has no Strength score and cannot manipulate objects. Its gaseous form renders the smoke sentinel immune to all nonmagical attack forms. Even when hit by spells or magic weapons, it takes only half damage. Spells and effects that do not deal damage have only a 50% chance of affecting a smoke sentinel. A smoke sentinel has no natural armor bonus, but it has a deflection bonus equal to its Charisma bonus.",

			"**Tethered (Su)** A smoke sentinel is tethered to a hollow physical object (usually a small box or totem) from which it can travel no farther than 1 mile. An intelligent creature who holds the construct's tether for at least 1 hour gains the ability to control the smoke sentinel as though it were the target of a [dominate monster](spell/dominate_monster) spell. This control lasts until another intelligent creature holds the tether for an hour or more, whereupon that creature gains control of the construct. If its controller dies or otherwise ceases to command the smoke sentinel, the construct continues carrying out its most recent command. Should its last command be a finite task, the smoke sentinel reverts to the role of guardian when finished, keeping potential threats away from the site of its tether. A smoke sentinel can compress to fit within its tether as a fullround action. While in the tether, it recovers from damage at a rate of 1 hit point per hour.",
			"",
			"#### Description",
			"",
			"Smoke sentinels are clouds of sentient black smoke that protect isolated ruins throughout the shattered continent of Azlant. As amorphous clouds, smoke sentinels have no distinguishing features, but they often extend their bodies into long tendrils that slither along the ground like hungry vines. No matter how thin a smoke sentinel may make its form, its smoke remains thick and opaque, hiding everything within it from view. Though the strange electrical energy that courses through its body crackles and arcs, the resulting illumination provides no insight into what may lie at the cloud's heart.",
			"",
			"A smoke sentinel usually attempts to determine an intruder's intentions through use of its [see alignment](spell/see_alignment) and [detect thoughts](spell/detect_thoughts) spell-like abilities. It may take the form of a trusted associate or loved one in order to further interact with the trespasser and bring deeper thoughts and motivations to the creature's surface thoughts. Unless directly threatened or certain that the target of its investigation poses a threat to its master or other sworn charge, the smoke sentinel employs illusions and fear to confuse and frighten the interloper away. Only in extreme cases or when instructed to do so does the construct use its deadly physical attacks.",
			"",
			"While it can compress and condense its form to fit into incredibly small spaces, a smoke sentinel most often appears as a weightless cloud occupying approximately 3,500 cubic feet of space.",
			"",
			"Smoke sentinels were created through magical means to serve as resolute sentries of their creators' homes, protecting inhabitants and their livelihoods from attackers and raiders. Smoke sentinels do not need to eat, sleep, or breathe, and they can compress to fit into extremely small spaces due to their gaseous nature.",
			"",
			"Smoke sentinels do not age, though as they grow accustomed to their land and as they see creatures and people they were meant to protect slowly die off, they are prone to becoming overprotective. Each smoke sentinel is created along with an Azlanti artifact that anchors it to a specific spot. If it moves more than a mile from this tether, it loses control of its physical form, and if kept beyond this range for too long, it might disperse completely. As such, smoke sentinels are careful about the range of their patrols.",
			"",
			"Despite their gaseous nature, smoke sentinels are capable of coalescing the smoke that makes up their bodies into clawlike tendrils to protect themselves. A smoke sentinel often reveals its presence with whirring, almost mechanical noises that permeate the air as it approaches.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"Smoke sentinels are most often depicted in ancient Azlanti texts as benign creatures that warded off invaders and helped their culture flourish in times of great struggle. While many in the modern day consider smoke sentinels to be extremely dangerous, the creatures do not murder without cause. If someone takes a relic from its creator, desecrates a corpse, or steps onto ground its programming denotes as hallowed, a smoke sentinel seeks only to right that wrong.",
			"",
			"At the peak of the Azlanti civilization, smoke sentinels took the forms of Azlanti warriors and patrolled the borders of towns and cities to ward off invaders. They were considered great protectors, and they were occasionally used in Azlanti armies as a way to induce terror in enemy ranks.",
			"",
			"There are few examples of rogue smoke sentinels in history, but in late Azlant just prior to Earthfall, some priests with delusions of grandeur or revenge fresh on their minds created smoke sentinels not as protectors, but as tools for assassination and sabotage. However, once such a smoke sentinel completed its mission-and it would inevitably complete its mission-the construct would return to its tether not to regenerate but to destroy the artifact in a form of construct suicide. This raised an ethical concern among the Azlanti: Are smoke sentinels truly just constructs, built only to serve a singular purpose? Or do they have consciousness, a soul? This ethical dilemma eventually led to the practice of using smoke sentinels falling out of favor, and even being banned completely in some regions. As a result, by the time Azlant sank into the sea, very few smoke sentinels remained, and fewer still survive to this day.",
			"",
			"### Construction",
			"",
			"While many secrets of Azlanti technology have been recovered from the depths of time, expert golemcrafters have yet to reverse engineer the means of building a smoke sentinel and tether. Current theories postulate that unique [ioun stones](magic-wondrous/ioun_stone) must be utilized in the creation process, though what shape or color these ioun stones need to take remains a mystery."

The only thing a snallygaster craves more than blood is alcohol, and it spends much of each autumn scouring its territory for fermenting fruit, on which it gorges itself until thoroughly inebriated. Intoxicated snallygasters are extremely aggressive.",

In order to preserve energy between meals, a somalcygot enters a trancelike hibernation during which it burrows in circles beneath the surface of its territory with unthinking repetition. When it detects another creature nearby, the somalcygot awakens and enters a frenzy to capitalize on the rare meal, fighting relentlessly until the prey either dies or escapes. Only rarely do somalcygots pursue prey beyond the boundaries of their claimed hunting grounds, a tendency that serves both to preserve the creature's energy and to avoid needless conflict with other somalcygots that claim neighboring regions.",

They dig tunnels and burrows, shoring up the sides of the passages with sticky saliva that hardens into a temporary cement. Since they constantly toil in their warrens, their tawny fur collects fine dust and sand particles. As an instinctive means of defense, soricos shake themselves violently, which loosens the sand and creates a distracting cloud of dust that allows them to escape from predators. Soricos measure 3 feet long, stand 2 feet tall, and weigh 100 pounds. Those who hunt soricos find their meat delicious, comparable to that of a farm-raised rabbit."

Although a soulpierced is incorporeal, a corporeal creature can remove the blade as though it had the [ghost touch](magic-enhancement/ghost_touch_weapon) magic weapon special ability. Removing the blade requires a successful disarm or steal combat maneuver made as a full-round action. As a free action, a creature removing the blade must succeed at a DC 35 Knowledge (arcana) or Knowledge (religion) check to recite an appropriate prayer; otherwise, the blade isn't removed, even if the combat maneuver was successful. The blade disintegrates once removed, and the creature that removed it must succeed at a DC 29 Fortitude save or incur 2d4 negative levels. The save DC is Charisma-based.",

			"A soulpierced is created from the tormented spirit of a victim of ritualistic murder. Each soulpierced is bound to the site of its death by a magical blade thrust through its chest. Even as a spirit, the soulpierced's still-beating heart is gruesomely visible, as is the blade stabbed through it. Although a soulpierced resembles a ghostly version of its living form, its features are so twisted by rage and grief that it is difficult to recognize. Prevented from moving on and receiving Pharasma's judgment but also unable to be returned to life, these tormented creatures grow increasingly bitter and angry, magically inflicting its frustration and rage onto nearby creatures.",
			"",
			"Even those who destroy a soulpierced find their work incomplete, as the blade through the creature's heart causes it to rejuvenate in the same location within days. Only by removing the soulpiercing blade can anyone free the creature and permanently eliminate it as a threat. But the attempt itself poses grave danger, as close proximity to the soulpierced exposes the opponent to the creature's wrathful attack and the blade itself can harm those who remove it.",
			"",
			"No soulpierced is created by accident, nor could they be. The wicked spellcasters willing to perform the elaborate and expensive magical ritual to transform a victim into a soulpierced must do so deliberately and with the utmost care. The ritual is a closely guarded secret but incorporates powerful spells such as [create greater undead](spell/create_greater_undead) and [soul bind](spell/soul_bind). It destroys the victim's body, leaving only her heart, and places her under a permanent [nondetection](spell/nondetection) spell that prevents allies or next of kin from locating her. The ritual to create a soulpierced is usually performed in some location where the perpetrator is confident the spirit won't be discovered, such as an isolated crypt, remote woods, or an abandoned ruin. Because of the complexity and expense of the ritual, the spellcaster must be extraordinarily invested, and thus nearly every soulpierced was once a person with powerful enemies, such as a monarch with influential contenders for the throne, a military leader capable of turning the tide of a war, or a government advisor with significant authority.",
			"",
			"The blade used in the ritual must have a personal connection to the victim, but need not be a conventional weapon; while one soulpierced's blade might be an heirloom dagger, another's might be a shard of mirror. The ritual can anchor any creature that has a soul, although non-humanoid victims are rare.",
			"",
			"The torment of the binding ritual, coupled with years' or even centuries-of loneliness and spite, erodes the remains of what personality the soulpierced had in life. Each soulpierced is unaware of the link between the blade in its heart and its perpetual torment. Although it's not impossible to convince a soulpierced that its blade must be removed, it is very difficult to overcome a soulpierced's agony and suspicion. Even if successfully convinced of the link between her suffering and her blade, the soulpierced is unable to remove the blade from her own heart and highly unlikely to trust another creature to do so.",
			"",
			"Removing a soulpierced's blade is no simple matter. If the creature attempting to remove the blade isn't familiar with powerful counter-curses and prayers of unbinding, the blade remains firmly lodged in the soulpierced's heart. Even if successfully removed, the blade rots the life force of any creature that removes it, while crumbling the blade itself to powder.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"Each soulpierced haunts a lonely location and is likely to spend many years without seeing another sentient creature. Multiple soulpierced might share a location, especially if the spellcaster who created them did so in great number or returned to a favorite spot to perform the ritual on successive victims. In a case where the family or friends of a victim have orchestrated a deliberate and coordinated search, a bounty hunter or tracker might encounter a soulpierced, but the spirit's wrath makes it unlikely a scout returns to report on what he has found. A powerful spellcaster might take advantage of a soulpierced's endless rage to create an intractable guard, permanently anchored to the murder site and unwilling to let creatures pass without experiencing the soulpierced's fury."

			"Spellgorgers are among the more terrifying threats that face an adventuring spellcaster-shapeless entities that feed on magic. Rarely encountered in large numbers, spellgorgers are most common in remote reaches of the Darklands, where they often prey upon the numerous spellcasting races that dwell below, such as the drow, duergar, derro, and svirfneblin. A spellgorger prefers the \"taste\" of arcane magic, but can feed on divine and psychic magic as well.",
			"",
			"A spellgorger resembles a floating sphere of violet sludge that exudes a slithery forest of fine tendrils and sparks of magical energy. A typical specimen is 10 feet in diameter and weighs 1,000 pounds, but spellgorgers' supernatural ability to fly and swift reflexes belie their massive bulk and weight.",
			"",
			"The original spellgorgers, like so many of the stranger magical predators of the world, arose from failed magical experiments. The most pervasive theory of their source is an attempt by drow wizards to solidify raw magic and give it life in a fleshforge-making a magical spell into a free-willed, living creature.",
			"",
			"Spellgorgers feed on magic, but the method by which they do so is not only unusual, but also highly disturbing and unsettling to spellcasters. In order to feed, a spellgorger first engulfs a spellcasting creature. It then pulls prepared magical potential from its engulfed victim, effectively stealing spells and casting them to serve its own agenda (often using these stolen spells to defend itself from the engulfed victim's allies). When a spellgorger casts spells in this parasitic manner, it is able to absorb the magical \"runoff\" from the spell as sustenance. This act is performed without deliberate malice, despite how humiliating it is for spellcasters who have been parasitized in this way. Indeed, a spellgorger does not benefit from the death of an engulfed spellcaster, and these creatures often go to great lengths to keep their victims alive. Once a spellgorger has expended all of its victim's spells, it generally expels the spellcaster, likely unharmed save for being entirely drained of magic, and moves on to seek other prey. A spellgorger is capable of using many magical items as well, but curiously, it cannot feed from magic within a scroll, wand, or other device-something about the mixing of organic life and the act of spellcasting combines in just the right way to nourish these curious creatures.",
			"",
			"When they grow too large, spellgorgers reproduce through spontaneous fission.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"Spellgorgers are remarkably intelligent and have an uncannily strong sense of self and personality. Scholars suspect that much of this is a side effect of the nature of their feeding-that when spellgorgers consume magic from an engulfed creature, they retain a slight trace of that creature's intellect and charisma. Then, as the spellgorgers reproduce, this store of mental acuity is handed down through the generations rather than lost upon death. If true, at some point in the future, spellgorgers may count themselves as some of the most intelligent forms of life on the Material Plane.",
			"",
			"Yet despite their intellect, most spellgorgers are content to waste their minds in private philosophical debates. While they may engage in long, complicated discussions with their prey, when two spellgorgers meet, they often form strong bonds and eagerly discuss all matters magical. Curiously, spellgorgers directly related by fission do not get along well at all, and are prone to violent arguments; for this reason, when a spellgorger splits, its two \"young\" generally seek new homes far from one another."

Little can convince a criosphinx to part with even a single coin save the lust that its kind bears for the gynosphinx. Criosphinxes crave mating with gynosphinxes above all else, and pay well for the whereabouts of a female, or better yet, a well-crafted riddle that might impress one.

			"Cynosphinxes are hoarders of secret knowledge and guardians of abandoned ruins. Those who intrude upon the realm of a cynosphinx and fail to offer a tribute of secret knowledge provoke the beast to savage anger. Whereas androsphinxes barter information for the sake of achieving enlightenment, cynosphinxes strive to learn secrets to gain power over others. Often, a cynosphinx enters a parley hoping to secretly learn clandestine information with its ability to read its target's thoughts, steering the conversation toward such topics with leading questions. Quick to anger, the cynosphinx kills those it feels are inferior, knowing that it still has the opportunity to converse with the trespasser after its death. If the knowledge it seeks is relayed during clever, amusing conversation, the sphinx rewards the provider with invaluable clues to a desired object or location, or simply safe passage through its territory, though the cynosphinx rarely shares any of its own secrets willingly. A cynosphinx stands 12 feet tall at its powerful shoulders. Built of muscular flesh and sinew, a cynosphinx weighs roughly 1,200 pounds.",

			"### Ecology",
			"",
			"Rare even among sphinxes, a cynosphinx is a terror of the desert. Were it not for its fixation on secrets, it would be a scourge to all who dwell among the sands. Its canine head grants it a sense of smell superior to that of other sphinxes, giving it the ability to stalk prey in conditions of poor visibility. Though it possesses massive wings, a cynosphinx is an ungainly flier. In addition to hit-andrun attacks from above, one of its favored tactics is to hover over an enemy and whip up a cloud of dust and debris to blind its prey.",
			"",
			"Like all sphinxes, a cynosphinx is long-lived, but it has a particularly selfish desire to cling to its lengthy existence, making it a careful combatant who will flee rather than perish. This obsession usually leads a cynosphinx to search out the secrets of longevity and immortality, not just for its own use, but also because it knows the value mortals place on such secrets.",
			"",
			"A cynosphinx requires little sustenance and even prefers to feed on carrion, finding rotting flesh more palatable. Because of this, an area with a few hundred gravesites can sustain a cynosphinx for several millennia. Even when a cynosphinx makes a fresh kill, the creature lets it rot for several days before devouring the carcass. Its diet mainly consists of the decaying corpses found abandoned within its lair, with bone marrow being a particular treat. Due to its affinity with the dead, and its obsessive need to learn secrets, a cynosphinx always interacts with its exhumed morsels, speaking with the dead and learning what it can before fully consuming the body. Like a scholar devouring knowledge from a book, a cynosphinx pores over both the physical and intellectual particulars of its strange corpse diet.",
			"",
			"When a cynosphinx it sees fit to mate-usually once its will to live ends-it needs a gynosphinx, just like other sphinxes do. However, due to the cynosphinx's disdain for mating, not to mention gynosphinxes' utter disgust toward cynosphinxes, this type of union is rare. In nearly every case, the resulting offspring from such a pairing is a cynosphinx. Gynosphinxes want nothing to do with such offspring, and offer no protest when the cynosphinx takes the progeny away. Before it dies, the new father brings the child to its lair, leaving its progeny a carcass to learn from and feed upon.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"Cynosphinxes dwell among the abandoned burial sites of civilized folk. Due to their obsession with lost secrets and their steady diet of carrion, a cynosphinx's ideal lair is a graveyard, tomb, or necropolis. When a cynosphinx takes up residence at such a site, the otherwise contemplative creature defends its territory with tenacity. However, if a visitor approaches a cynosphinx's territory with the promise of divulging secret lore, the sphinx may grant an audience. In such an instance, if the promise of lore fails to satisfy the cynosphinx, the intruder finds herself quickly under attack. Fortunately, many tombs and necropolises have tight nooks and narrow crannies far too small for a cynosphinx to maneuver in. If a clever traveler offers to explore these regions for the obsessive cynosphinx, she may find this arrangement to be just the bartering chip she needs to leave the sphinx's territory alive.",
			"",
			"Solitary by nature, a cynosphinx truly feels comfortable only among the dead, and leaves its lair only for brief, localized patrols or when a longer journey promises to unearth lost knowledge. Cynosphinxes are always male and treat other sphinxes as inferior, save for androsphinxes. Cynosphinxes ignore criosphinxes, subjugate hieracosphinxes, and only associate with gynosphinxes for the purpose of mating-an act cynosphinxes find revolting. If a cynosphinx finds its only recourse to extend its legacy is through mating, this is usually done through blackmailing a gynosphinx or resorting to other forms of coercion or subterfuge. In fact, a cynosphinx would rather discover a means of extending its own lifespan than sire an offspring-as they view even their own progeny as threats to their well-guarded store of knowledge. Toward the androsphinx, the cynosphinx harbors a seething jealousy. Envious of the androsphinx's superior intellect, wisdom, and guile, a cynosphinx will plot to murder any androsphinx it discovers. Cynosphinxes believe they can extract a wealth of knowledge and learn powerful secrets from the carcass of a slaughtered androsphinx using their speak with dead ability. If a cynosphinx's food supply is abundant, the one category of creatures with whom it will ally is the undead. It is common for a cynosphinx to take a place at the head of an undead menace or even to serve a greater power such as a graveknight or a lich.",
			"",
			"### Cynosphinxes as Mounts",
			"",
			"Although they have the physical ability to carry a rider, cynosphinxes cannot be trained as mounts. They are intelligent beings who choose for themselves whether to accept a rider. A worthy rider is usually a powerful undead creature of evil alignment with whom the cynosphinx has an obsession, or who has promised eldritch secrets in return for service. Often, a creature petitioning a cynosphinx for this arrangement must provide such knowledge regularly for the cynosphinx to continue to grant its consent as a steed. A cynosphinx is considered a special cohort, not a normal mount."

Anytime an elder sphinx's body takes damage while using astral projection, its astral form immediately becomes aware that it is in danger and can, as a free action, end the astral projection and begin reverting back to its natural form (though the process still takes 1 minute).

Though they have long since calcified into creatures of living limestone, these ancient creatures serve eternally as guardians, not of temples or other such terrestrial sites, but of forbidden knowledge and lore, much of which is beyond the understanding of lesser beings. Elder sphinxes are highly protective of the vast wealth of information they possess and strive to defend it from those they deem unworthy.",

			"Sphinxes gradually become more sedentary over their long lifespans as they lose their inclination toward physical activity. The eldest and most knowledgeable sphinxes undergo a transformation that allows them to remain undisturbed as they ponder the knowledge they've obtained. They turn into creatures of living limestone and grow to tremendous proportions, until they resemble ancient and weathered statues. No longer content with the Material Plane, elder sphinxes cast their consciousnesses out into the Astral Plane and beyond in search of the secrets of the universe, as their mortal hunger for nourishment is replaced by a metaphysical hunger for knowledge.",

			"Scholars claim that some elder sphinxes predate even the Age of Darkness and thus possess firsthand knowledge of the world as it once was, and have learned of the contemporary world only through their astral wandering or during the rare times they walk in their corporeal form. Whatever purpose they served in their youth has long since been forgotten or abandoned, leaving them to pursue more esoteric ambitions. These ancient creatures exist solely to seek out new information and to understand the great mysteries of the universe while their stony physical remains sit idle as time passes them by. In time, these elder sphinxes come to be seen as monuments, and sometimes humanoid cultures gather around them and worship them as idols. Infrequently, elder sphinxes can be coaxed to trade ancient knowledge for more current information or for arcane secrets they have yet to divine from the planes. Finding knowledge or information beyond an elder sphinx's experiences, however, is as monumental a task as locating one of their kind.",
			"",
			"Elder sphinxes have little to no contact with other sphinxes. This only occurs when a younger, less powerful sphinx seeks out one of these magnificent specimens to plead for lost knowledge. When elder sphinxes do come into contact with one another, it is always a meeting of great purpose, typically on a matter of such importance that it requires them to share their ancient wisdom and unfathomable lore."

			"Although there are many different species of sphinx, the one certain scholars refer to as the \"gynosphinx\" (a name many sphinxes find insulting) is a wise and majestic creature that is nevertheless terrifying when angered. Less moralistic than their male counterparts (the \"androsphinx\"-a different creature entirely than the sphinx presented here), sphinxes are careful and methodical in their decision-making, and pride themselves on their cold logic and impartiality. They have little patience for the lesser sphinx variants, seeing them as little better than animals. Sphinxes love riddles and complicated dilemmas, and treasure strange facts and arcane trivia far more than gold or gems",
			"",
			"While not great scholars in any traditional sense, sphinxes' great appreciation of puzzles leads them to research shallowly in a wide variety of subjects, and they can often be invaluable sources of information, especially when making use of their magical abilities. They are usually happy to barter with other races, and regularly trade material goods for information or new and interesting quandaries. They make excellent guardians for temples, tombs, and other important locations, so long as they are kept adequately entertained. Sphinxes place great value on politeness, but can be dangerously temperamental-while they may decide to share their latest riddles with travelers out of altruism, they think little of devouring those who don't give their dilemmas adequate attention or provide useful insight.",
			"",
			"Sphinxes are typically 10 feet long and about 800 pounds. While their wings are capable of holding them aloft for long periods of time, they are poor fliers, and prefer to land before engaging foes, lashing out with their powerful claws. Though fiercely territorial, they tend to give intruders plenty of warning before attacking.",

Hieracosphinxes attack other sphinxes whenever they have them at a disadvantage.

The other species of sphinx likewise hold nothing but disdain for hieracosphinxes, and typically attack these vile beasts on sight.",
			"",
			"Hieracosphinxes guard their territory ruthlessly against weaker intruders, seldom giving warning before they attack. They have no use for banter and riddles, making most efforts at diplomacy rather ineffective, but can be convinced to call off their attacks by convincing shows of force coupled with information on the location of weaker prey or a gynosphinx. Though poor fliers, they still prefer to fight from the air, the better to escape if the combat turns against them.",
			"",
			"As they lack the ego and resourcefulness of the rest of their breed, hieracosphinxes can be pressed into service of mounts, particularly by those of similarly evil dispositions. Hieracosphinxes chafe under such service but submit to more powerful riders, though they still inflict their foul tempers on any weaker creatures that happen by. A grown hieracosphinx can easily consume a full horse's worth of meat in a day, making their upkeep rather expensive. Even with these drawbacks, hieracosphinx eggs command values of up to 1,500 gp on the open market, as do young hieracosphinxes. It takes 3 years for a hieracosphinx to reach maturity, after which an untrained hieracosphinx only rarely accepts a rider without magical compulsion. Trainers, though hard to come by, charge thousands of gold pieces to rear and train a hieracosphinx, owing to the risk to life and limb.",
			"",
			"A light load for a hieracosphinx is up to 350 pounds; a medium load, 351-700 pounds; and a heavy load, 701-1,050 pounds. A typical hieracosphinx is just short of 9 feet long and weighs 600 pounds. Hieracosphinxes detest bearing a rider into battle, thus increasing the DCs of any combat-related Ride checks by +5.",

Implanting an egg in a host is a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity, and the target must be helpless but alive. Once an egg is implanted, it exudes paralytic enzymes that not only keep the victim in state of perpetual paralysis, but also keep it nourished and alive in its comatose but fully aware state. This condition lasts until the egg hatches in 1d6 weeks, at which point the young spider eater consumes most of its host, killing it. An egg can be surgically removed with a DC 25 Heal check (this check deals 2d6 points of damage to the host regardless of success), at which point the host recovers from the paralysis in 1d6 rounds. Any magical effect that removes paralysis or disease (such as remove paralysis, remove disease, or heal) also destroys the egg, but mere immunity to paralysis or disease does not offer protection.",

Unfortunately for other creatures, when a spider eater is denied its preferred prey, it seeks out any living creature it can find to serve as a host for its ravenous young.",
			"",
			"When hunting, a spider eater drops from the air onto its victim, stinging the prey with its barbed tail. The creature then returns to the air and hovers, waiting for its venom to take hold. Once the opponent succumbs to paralysis, the spider eater lands again, either to feed or implant its egg.",
			"",
			"Although more intelligent than the typical beast, to the point where it can understand a language (usually Aklo), the spider eater is relatively slow-witted. Nevertheless, it is intelligent enough that it resists training-those who seek to ally with spider eaters must befriend them via diplomacy and gifts of spiders to feed upon or implant eggs into, or via intimidation and coercion.",

			"The spirit only kills when she absolutely has to, such as when confronted by mindless creatures or irredeemable undead, and even then only if sparing them would create a threat to others. She prefers to let her aura of charming change hostile creatures into temporary allies, giving her time to move aggressive opponents away from innocents and speak words of diplomacy under more amiable conditions. She uses her stunning bolts against creatures she believes can be talked into surrender or peace, reserving her glaive and attack spells for recalcitrant foes and alien or mindless things that absolutely cannot understand love or beauty.",

			"The spirit is a creature of love and is open with her emotions to all mortals. She treasures the presence of every infant, child, adult, and animal, and can appreciate the beauty of any landscape, no matter how stark, blasted, or strange. She is generous, compassionate, and tolerant, and those who meet her under pleasant circumstances can't help but agree that she is one of the nicest creatures they've ever met. However, most of her interactions on the mortal world occur when some great love or beautiful work of art is threatened. At these times she grows quiet, her eyes burn with the fire of true love threatened, and her face becomes the stern mask of an artist lost in the moment of finishing her masterpiece. When inspired by this cause, her hands wield glaive, spell, and ray in a beautiful and enthralling dance, as though they move to the very music of creation.",
			"",
			"The spirit has an excellent memory for names and faces, and enjoys tracing the family trees of Shelyn's agathion servitors, often recognizing a distant mortal relation 10 generations later. She is friends with all of the goddess's minions, and shares this affection with their mortal relatives. Though she is not a gossip, she listens to her fellow celestials and is aware of who they've helped in the mortal world; she keeps tabs on those who have benefited from the goddess's favor in the past and, if necessary, might be willing to repay a past favor.",
			"",
			"The minions of Zon-Kuthon fill her with pity. Whenever she encounters them, she tries to steal them away to a temple of her creator and have the priests try to cleanse the mental stains of that dark god. She tries this with his divine servants as well, with much more limited success."

Typically consisting of at least 5,000 sprites, these swarms are known for inflicting pain upon any creatures in their paths. Sprite swarms typically form only when the sprites' village is threatened by a large number of intruders or a single powerful foe; however, the malevolent sprites of Geb are quick to form swarms when faced with intrusion of any kind.",

			"In some parts of Golarion where sprites are known to exist, those accused of crimes or other unacceptable behavior are sentenced to face a sprite swarm so that nature itself can judge them. If a sprite swarm forms to drive one of the accused away, he is guilty; if not, he is innocent. Most of those sent forth never return, having run afoul of the sprites' protective instincts, but occasionally the sprites allow someone they deem not a threat to live-quite independently of their actual guilt or innocence."

Star monarchs rarely intervene directly in combat, more often helping good creatures by aiding them from the shadows, guiding their paths, or guarding them while they sleep.

The bulk of these creatures drift through the vastness of the Dark Tapestry, but without the starflight ability (like that of [byakhees](monster/byakhee)), thousands or even millions of years can pass before one manages to find a planet where it can descend to feed.

Many of these rites are deliberately ambiguous promises of the aid of a powerful spirit from the depths of space-designed to serve up the unsuspecting occultist as a hungry star vampire's inaugural meal on the new world. The source of these dangerous rituals is unclear, for it is unlike the alien mind of a star vampire to conceive of such tactics. Likely, these treacherous spells were inflicted upon the world by a misanthropic lunatic eager to bring pain and doom upon those foolish enough to attempt to contact alien beings.",
			"",
			"Star vampires either have no need or have lost the ability to reproduce, and thus their numbers in the universe are limited, dwindling as individuals perish. Yet, the sheer number of star vampires that drift through space, while spread thin, is vast enough that the vampiric race is in no danger of going extinct any time soon.",
			"",
			"The strange noises issued by a star vampire seem to serve no purpose, although they tend to sound like mocking laughter at times. These creatures can speak if they wish (although few know any language other than Aklo), but their voices are wet and slobbery and do not prevent the tittering sounds they emit from continuing-only when feeding do these monsters fall relatively silent.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"Ancient beyond most worlds, whatever realm first spawned these interstellar predators is long gone, vanished even from the memories of the star vampires themselves, along with any culture or name for themselves they may have once had. Yet, the star vampires do not mourn this loss. They have no need for companionship, no desire to leave a legacy, and no drive to colonize new worlds, for their minds and motivations are as alien as their strange shapes to most planet-bound societies.",
			"",
			"Some star vampires grow mightier than the typical specimen presented here, gaining size and Hit Dice with no apparent limit-although when they grow particularly large, they are invariably hunted down and destroyed by great heroes on the worlds they infest. Other star vampires gain class levels to become more powerful, preferring to focus on classes such as oracle, psychic, and rogue, eschewing classes that place too much emphasis on the use of gear or the acquisition of companions. Star vampires with class levels tend to pose more of a threat than those that merely grow in size, for the former often develop all-too-human goals and desires beyond simply feeding. These creatures are fond of forming cults and playing the role of gods to primitive societies or fanatics who are incapable of discerning the monster from a divine sending. It is rare for a star vampire to worship a deity, but those that do tend to venerate Nyarlathotep, Shub-Niggurath, or Yog-Sothoth.",

			"### Origins",
			"",
			"The creatures known now as \"star vampires\" were named such by Sandy Petersen in Chaosium's Call of Cthulhu Roleplaying Game, and they've gone on to drink the blood of countless inquisitive investigators and hapless heroes. The first star vampire noted in print lacked its name, appearing in Robert Bloch's short story, \"The Shambler from the Stars,\" which the author dedicated to H. P. Lovecraft-after receiving written permission to put Lovecraft into the story and have a monster eat him. Lovecraft returned the favor by having an equally grisly fate await a Bloch-inspired character in the short story, \"star vampires\""

On a successful save, the creature is merely staggered for 1 round.

Humanoid in shape, their immense bodies have rubbery flesh that seems to wriggle and seethe like a half-solidified ooze. Tremendous draconic wings, murderous taloned hands, and a tentacled visage that evokes the alien gaze of an octopus complete the being's monstrous shape. This malevolent race has a name, yet it is no name known to the sane. Among mortal scholars, they are known merely by the name of their greatest priest-they are the starspawn of Cthulhu.",

			"The star-spawn of Cthulhu have a strange, mutable anatomy-their form is not fixed.

Despite this mutable shape, the star-spawn's forms generally don't deviate far from that of an octopus-headed, winged humanoid, likely because of the powerful links their otherworldly minds have to their overlord and master, who lies dead but dreaming in the lost city of R-lyeh.",
			"",
			"Although they typically appear as immense humanoid creatures with rubbery hides and octopoid heads, the star-spawn of Cthulhu are not any more aquatic in nature than they are terrestrial-that they're often associated with a planet's oceans lies more in the simple fact that oceans often cover the majority of a planet's surface. The creatures themselves, being equally at home on land, at sea, or in the depths of space, make no real distinction between such regions, choosing them as the sites of their cities and temples for purposes only they can know. Servants of the alien gods of the void, they work upon the worlds they invade to wipe them clean of indigenous life in preparation for the eventual time when the deep void expands to replace all that exists with its strange realities.",
			"",
			"The star-spawn of Cthulhu hold little malice toward indigenous life-they simply can't proceed with their plans for a world while such life exists. Just as a human might move into a house thinking it to be abandoned, only to discover colonies of ants dwelling within the building's walls, the star-spawn work to eradicate indigenous infestations. Their methods seldom vary from world to world-those whose intellects they can influence via dreams and nightmares they besiege as the victims sleep, seeding the growth of destructive cults and societies. These groups in turn further the star-spawn's agenda, preparing the world and bringing it to the brink of destruction. When such worlds are poised to tear themselves apart from within through unrest, civil war, excessive pollution, or genocide, the star-spawn mobilize their cults to end all things. The only reward such cults may receive for their (sometimes unwitting) aid is the dubious honor of being among the final few to be eradicated, for the star-spawn have no interest in and feel no responsibility toward their pawns.",
			"",
			"The fact that the star-spawn's plans to bring about the eradication of life span centuries or even millennia should not be mistaken for sloth or lassitude-the star-spawn are inhumanly patient, and the preparation of the universe's worlds must precisely follow an unknowable schedule, for only when the exact cosmic convergences are in place and the stars are right can they make their final moves to end all things. This time frame does give some worlds a chance to discover the star-spawn's influence and to delay or even defeat their world's starspawned doom, but such tales of triumph are rare in the face of the void's relentless tides.",
			"",
			"The star-spawn of Cthulhu war with many other strange races out of time and space, including [elder things](monster/elder_thing) and the servitors of other [Great Old Ones](subtype/great_old_one). They have also been known to use these creatures-and other races such as the mi-go-as pawns, slaves, or minions to promote their immortal agenda.",
			"",
			"Though the star-spawn themselves hail from a distant world deep in the void and can be found on countless other realms as gods and monsters, their lord [Cthulhu](monster/cthulhu) dwells upon a distant planet far removed from any commonly visited world. Yet while Cthulhu lies imprisoned in the corpse-city of R-lyeh deep under a great ocean, his dreams resonate still in the minds of his starspawn, and from there touch upon the dreams of many slumbering poets and philosophers on countless worlds. Guided by their knowledge of their master's great plan, and updated by his far-reaching dreams, the star-spawn of Cthulhu proceed inevitably toward their goals."

In this way, the armor and accoutrements of a veteran steam hog serve as a record of the battles and wars the beast has fought in. When such a steam hog falls in battle, its armor-and thus its history-are often kept by sentimental fire giant handlers as treasured heirlooms. Steam hogs average 16 feet long from snout to tail and 8 feet tall at the shoulder. They can weigh up to 3 tons, or 4 tons when equipped with adamantine scale barding."

They are fond of hiding near watering holes and waiting for travelers to drop their guard, then swooping out to attach and drink their fill by thrusting their long feeding tubes into unprotected veins. After feeding they flap heavily off into the mud and reeds to lay their eggs and rest until hunger drives them to hunt again.",
			"",
			"Stirges are usually 1 foot long, with a wingspan of twice that, and weigh just under a pound. Their coloration is rust-red or reddish-brown with a dirty yellow underbelly, though stirges that have not fed in some time are often pale pink, their color deepening as they gorge."

			"",
			"#### Description",
			"",
			"Stampeding across the sky in booming herds, storm aurochs resemble nothing so much as vast and powerful thunderstorms bearing down across Golarion. Storm and cloud giants value these magnificent beasts not only for their meat and hides, but also as symbols of mystic power and divine strength. Though ostensibly domesticated centuries ago by storm giants, storm aurochs remain among the most fearsome and dangerous of the creatures that pass through Golarion's skies. A storm aurochs is roughly twice the size of a normal aurochs, growing up to 20 feet long and standing 15 feet tall at the shoulder. Storm aurochs weigh on average anywhere from 5 to 7 tons, with females being noticeably smaller and slimmer than males. Both males and females bear prodigious horns atop their heads that crackle with electrical energy, though the female's horns are slightly smaller.",
			"",
			"### Ecology",
			"",
			"Storm aurochs behave much as their more mundane cousins do. They are gregarious, herbivorous creatures that travel in herds of up to several dozen extended family members. These untamed herds are nomadic, and their migratory patterns mirror Golarion's natural weather patterns. Herds are fiercely territorial, with weather fronts forming the natural boundary between two herds' territories. Territorial disputes are common, though rarely lethal, and are often accompanied by terrific natural and magical storms.",
			"",
			"In addition to more traditional fodder, storm aurochs also graze on clouds. It is unclear whether or not this provides them any real nourishment, and it may be that they do so purely out of enjoyment. This can be a blessing and a curse for areas frequented by herds of storm aurochs; these areas soon become cloudless and sunny. Overgrazing can prevent much needed rain from reaching the ground, eventually leading to periods of drought and famine for those living nearby. For this reason, farmers often see herds of storm aurochs as pests. Aside from the dangers inherent in facing a storm aurochs, slaying one often comes with the added danger of drawing the ire of its storm giant owner, and so most communities prefer to relocate an aurochs herd as gently as possible, or perhaps even negotiate with the owner, rather than trying to slay the aurochs.",
			"",
			"Domesticated storm aurochs tolerate the presence and activities of storm or cloud giants with little hostility. This doesn't always hold for other races, and how a storm aurochs reacts to the presence of an adventuring party often depends on the temperament of the individual aurochs and the circumstances of the meeting. Storm aurochs are canny enough to recognize weapons, however, and usually respond to the approach of armed individuals of any species with extreme aggression.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"Storm aurochs are most commonly found in the possession of storm giants, where the animals spend their days grazing on the giants' expansive coastal estates. Storm giants keep aurochs for their meat, their hides, and their ability to influence the weather. The giants rarely use the creatures as beasts of burden, as unlike normal domesticated cattle or oxen, storm aurochs do not tolerate being placed in a yoke. A storm giant can use this fact to test the strength or patience of members of lesser races who come seeking the giant's aid. The giant first requires the petitioner to harness the giant's bull and plow his field. If the appellant accomplishes this task, either through cunning or brute strength, the giant is willing to hear her request. Those who give up the task or harm the aurochs in the effort, are banished from the giant's presence or slain outright.",
			"",
			"Cloud giants also keep herds of storm aurochs, though less commonly than storm giants. Cloud giants particularly favor the taste of storm aurochs meat, which they serve at feasts and gatherings of great importance, or to honor particularly noteworthy guests. Cloud giants also make use of storm aurochs in one of their more idiosyncratic pastimes; bull-leaping. Young cloud giants, newly come of age, take turns leaping over a charging storm aurochs, sometimes even boosting themselves off the auroch's horns to gain extra height and momentum. Leapers perform feats of acrobatics as they pass over the bull, each seeking to impress her fellows with her daring and prowess. Bull-leaping has fallen out of favor among younger cloud giants, who increasingly turn their attentions toward more philosophical pursuits, but it's still commonly practiced by more traditional, rural cloud giant families.",
			"",
			"Storm aurochs hold a deep spiritual significance for both storm and cloud giants. Cloud giants believe that the aurochs are gifts from Ioz-om, their version of Gozreh in his sky-father aspect, as a reward for their dutiful worship and piety. Storm giants also connect storm aurochs to Gozreh, through their sky-father incarnation, Hyjarth. Though most believe much as the cloud giants do, a few take their worship of the storm aurochs further. They claim that Hyjarth sacrificed the first storm aurochs to create the world itself, building the land from its bones and filling the seas with its blood. These storm giants gather in mystery cults across Golarion to reenact this ritual sacrifice, slaying a captive storm aurochs in order to honor Hyjarth and ensure that their lands and seas remain fruitful.",
			"",
			"### Skyshaping Stampede",
			"",
			"When storm aurochs gather in one place, they can have a profound impact on the weather. Such a gathering is known as a skyshaping stampede.",
			"",
			"Whenever three storm aurochs are within 10 feet of one another, all three of them can work together to use any of the following spell-like abilities: control weather, control winds (DC 16), fog cloud, sirocco (DC 17), or sleet storm.",
			"",
			"To take part in a skyshaping stampede, all three storm aurochs must take a full-round action to move through the area to be affected, usually by circling the spell's point of origin or tracing the path they desire winds to take. This movement provokes attacks of opportunity as normal. These spell-like abilities function at CL 12th (or at a caster level equal to the Hit Dice of the most powerful aurochs involved). The save DCs are Charisma-based, and function as if the herd has a Charisma score of 12, unless one of the aurochs has a higher Charisma score, in which case the spell-like ability DCs are adjusted by that aurochs's Charisma modifier."

			"Stranglereeds float motionless in calm lakes and rivers, waiting for prey to approach before lashing out with thick tendrils, grabbing their targets by the throat. Once the stranglereed has secured its prey, it pulls the victim beneath the surface of the water and directs the meal into it's \"mouth,\" a submerged circular orifice ringed with gnashing barbs and thorns. Exceptionally voracious, the stranglereed never stops feeding, and in desperate times, the industrious plant can leave the water briefly in order to hunt on land. These vicious plants may even chase slower prey if it breaks free of their tendrils, but fortunately, a stranglereed can spend only a limited amount of time out of water. Each stranglereed resembles a patch of normal reeds that covers a roughly circular 10-foot-diameter area, while its large, mawed central pod normally hides beneath the water's surface. A stranglereed weighs 800 pounds.",
			"",
			"A stranglereed reproduces by expelling seeds that float on air currents, much like dandelion fluff. Those that land on dry earth soon die or become meals for birds and other small animals, but those that land in water grow into full-sized stranglereed stalks within 1 month. A large body of water can be home to multiple stranglereeds, but only if the food supply can meet their demands."

These pitch-black guardians, lauded as heroes among their kind, release the fury of a nation upon any who cross them. Birthed from the largest eggs and raised for combat from nestlings, the greatest and most heavily scarred itaraak maintain a warriors' tradition from before a time of great darkness. This caste was originally formed to defend their people from a sister race of avians remembered only as the \"betrayers,\" but the itaraak have adapted their hit-andrun tactics, strikes from cover, and devastating diving charges to push back human intruders. The strix have also incorporated brutally efficient grappling techniques over the years, lifting land-bound opponents into the sky and letting the rocky terrain of the Devil's Perch deliver the final blow.",

			"These warriors run many civil matters that are outside the rokoa's spiritual authority with a gruff and haphazard democracy, with tribe members' votes weighted by the resources they provide the group. Only the rokoa herself can override these group decisions, and even then only for a time. Unfortunately, the itaraak's inflamed animosity and general bitterness often push them to make ill-advised raids on otherwise peaceful settlements, bringing down a disproportionate response from Chelish forces."

Their magnificent plumage is clipped and stuffed under bulky garments in their efforts to pass as humans, and they learn the clumsy speech and blunt gestures of their enemies to better walk among foes and learn their secrets. Few succeed perfectly without the aid of magic, though, so infiltrators also study the ancient concoctions used by their people for years, turning the arts of hunting and healing to deception and murder.",

			"Hearing the droning voices of humanity, seeing their featherless, leathery flesh, and dealing with their smell wears on any strix, but being unable to stretch one's wings and take flight when instinct calls for it is a chronic torture infiltrators must endure. Despite this discomfort, these quiet spies understand that of all the campaigns launched against the human settlements that encroach upon their territory, none is more important to maintaining the strix way of life than theirs. Posing as a friend and sometimes more to their despised foes, infiltrators keep a close and personal eye on their neighbors and position themselves for success in espionage and sabotage. The occasional assassination mission provides a small reward for their pain."

Draped in the mysterious regalia of the ancients, the newcomers supposedly hail from the Island of the Gods, a place of legend known only to the oldest rokoa. They entertain and inspire the curious locals who crowd around the roost with tales of their mythical homeland and promises of a return to glory. Most voyagers' tales describe strix ancestors sitting as equals beside a lost race of men and powerful elves, but then facing a mysterious exile on the winds of a green storm. The validity of their claims is open to debate, but the fact remains that the strix cannot account for the location of the bones of these visitors' ancestors."

			"Sturzstromers, also known as living landslides, are the elemental incarnations of earth in motion, from crushing rockfalls to landscape-altering avalanches. A sturzstromer consists of hundreds of stones, each moving of its own volition. When at rest, the stones lie atop one another; when the sturzstromer moves, the stones roll and churn, drawing smaller pebbles and dirt into their mass. Some observers are able to discern faces in the textures and colors of these rocks.",
			"",
			"The individual rocks that compose a sturzstromer are roughly a foot in diameter, though often irregularly shaped, and weigh approximately 80 pounds each. Altogether, a sturzstromer weighs around 12 tons, and when formed into a pile, the peak reaches 5 feet high.",
			"",
			"A sturzstromer consists of several hundred rocks each able to move independently. It is unclear to scholars whether a sturzstromer is made up of a mob of tiny elementals working in unison, or whether it is a single elemental spirit divided among countless bodies. Some sages speculate that when a powerful being of elemental earth is destroyed, its shattered remains reanimate in the form of a sturzstromer.",
			"",
			"A sturzstromer can be composed of any sort of common rock, though all of its constituent stones will be of the same type. The type of rock invariably matches a type common to the area where the creature lives. A sturzstromer that has lost stones (often due to damage) can replace them with stones from its environment, infusing them with the same elemental spirit that animates the sturzstromer.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"Sturzstromers dwell in only the largest caverns of the Elemental Plane of Earth. Here they can spend decades, even centuries, raising mountains of earth and stone, only to bring them crashing to the ground in the blink of an eye. Although strurzstromers do not seek out companions, other [earth elementals](unknown/earth_elementals) are sometimes drawn to them, aiding the living landslide in its creative and destructive endeavors. Some monastic [oreads](race/oread) and [shaitans](unknown/shaitans) view the sturzstromer's efforts as a metaphor for sublimation and catharsis. Due to how long it takes for sturzstromers to build their mountains, their constructed landscapes often become inhabited, usually by creatures unaware of the inevitable catastrophe.",
			"",
			"A sturzstromer is unlikely to travel to the Material Plane intentionally or even by accident. Those that exist on Golarion were conjured in ages past by powerful ritual magic. Whether to cause mayhem or to accelerate entropy, cultists of [Ayrzul](faith/ayrzul), [Groetus](faith/groetus), and [Rovagug](faith/rovagug) have called sturzstromers or attempted to magically dominate those previously conjured. Living landslides do not take well to being controlled, and this has been the downfall of many cults.",
			"",
			"Though others may see them as a destructive force of nature, sturzstromers view themselves as artists creating beauty in the rise and (especially) fall of mountains.",
			"",
			"### Variant Struzstromers",
			"",
			"Sturzstromers can form from any sort of stone, from sedimentary to igneous. Some sturzstromers contain traces of cold iron or silver ore, allowing them to overcome the corresponding damage reduction. The following variants emerge from those regions where two Elemental Planes overlap.",
			"",
			"Glacial: Though similar in many ways to a true sturzstromer, a glacial sturzstromer is composed of chunks of ice and snow. Hailing from the border between the Elemental Planes of Air and Water, they are found only upon snowy peaks on the Material Plane. A glacial sturzstromer has the same statistics as a normal sturzstromer except as follows: It loses the earth subtype and gains the cold and water subtypes. It loses all energy resistance, but it gains immunity to cold and vulnerability to fire. A glacial sturzstromer can use its landslide ability after taking either fire or sonic damage, and its mountaineer ability applies to snow and ice instead of rocky terrain. It speaks Auran and Aquan instead of Terran, and can use its [stone tell](spell/stone_tell) ability to speak with snow and ice instead of stone.",
			"",
			"Pyroclastic: Dwelling near the border between the Elemental Planes of Earth and Fire, pyroclastic sturzstromers can only be called to the Material Plane from active volcanoes. Though other sturzstromers may consist of volcanic rock, pyroclastic sturzstromers retain molten heat. A pyroclastic sturzstromer has the same statistics as a normal sturzstromer except as follows: It gains the fire subtype in addition to the earth subtype. It loses all energy resistance but gains immunity to fire and vulnerability to cold. Its attacks, including avalanches it creates, deal 2d6 fewer points of bludgeoning damage, but deal an additional 2d6 fire damage plus burn (2d6, DC 30). A pyroclastic sturzstromer can use its landslide ability after taking either cold or sonic damage. It speaks Ignan in addition to Terran."

			"Withered hermits wrapped in tattered black rags, these scarred, eyeless crones slip through the dark crevasses of both earth and time. Degenerate inheritors of the half-remembered, collapsed cyclops civilizations, the stygiras-or stone witches, as they are often called- command strange secrets of the earth and interpret the fateful energies of the depths. Ages of communion with the darkness and reliance upon alien magics have corrupted the stygiras from the primitive human witches their ancestors were countless ages ago, transforming them into a terrifying, debased breed infused with magics not their own. In many a savage land, these crones were once or are still worshiped as seers and demigods, weaving magic and communing with the earth to manipulate their servants into obeying their selfish and grotesque whims. In other realms, they haunt the night, prowling from their caves to feed upon the unwary or make alliances with those cruel and ambitious enough to believe their perverse counsel. Yet for all their perverse blasphemies and primitive desires, their powers to see what none should and reduce life to brittle stone proves enough to inspire dread and superstitious belief in nearly all who hear of the harsh stone witches.",

In rare cases, stygiras have been encountered clutching ancient and frighteningly sculpted stones exhibiting weird powers; in even more extraordinary cases, they have borne a veritable arsenal of crystals. While all gemstones of significant size allow a stygira to make use of her gem eye and gem gaze abilities, a few rare gems alter the crones' gaze abilities. These added abilities do not increase a stygira's CR.",

Area effects target the su and not its whelps, but individual whelps can be targeted with attacks (AC 18; 4 hp). If the su dies, its whelps die as well. A helpless su's whelps can be easily killed or removed from the su (removing them from the su also immediately kills them).

A su replaces lost whelps at a rate of one whelp per week.",

These young su cling to their parents' backs, feeding on parasites and scraps. Born at the apex of their psychic abilities, baby su slowly change shape and lose their powers over their first year-by the time they reach their full predatory form, all psychic magic has vanished. These furious new adults then leave to become providers for their own whelps. A grown su is 5 feet long and 90 pounds."

			"",
			"#### Description",
			"",
			"Hidden away in deep caverns or under the shade of mangroves in isolated swamps, sump stewards hum songs while they dutifully tend to verdant colonies of mushrooms and fungi. Vaguely humanoid in form, sump stewards carry old tree trunks, rotting logs, or other large tools to help them tend and protect these colonies while they make their rounds. As they work, they sing low, thrumming tunes that echo throughout their domain. Sump stewards-who, despite their intelligence, have no name for themselves and only indifferently acknowledge the names given by other races-have long, spindly limbs that possess great strength. Their form consists of mosses and lichens, with vines wrapping their bodies and holding them together. Mushrooms sprout all over the sump steward's form, although two red mushrooms glow where eyes would be. Some sump stewards grow long beards made of interwoven moss or grass.",
			"",
			"A sump steward stands almost 15 feet tall, though they are frequently hunched over and seem shorter. They weigh approximately 1,400 pounds.",
			"",
			"Sump stewards begin life as a pair of red mushrooms. These rare mushrooms often grow in fungal colonies tended by older sump stewards, who keep the new sump stewards sheltered and well-fed. Any creatures that invade the colony are quickly and firmly escorted away by the attendant sump stewards. By the time the red mushrooms are ready to sprout, an attendant sump steward has usually prepared a pile of twigs, leaves, moss, and other organic debris nearby. When the mushrooms sprout, they send shoots out to wrap around the offerings and form a body; the original red mushrooms serve as the new sump steward's eyes. Sump stewards that grow unattended form bodies from whatever debris is near and might seem mismatched as a result: some of these unattended sump stewards might walk with a limp, bear additional limbs, or have forms that incorporate bones or rocks.",
			"",
			"While sump stewards' bodies can look rather hodgepodge, they are resilient and strong. The vines that wrap their bodies regrow quickly and knit a sump steward back together with remarkable speed. While not inherently violent, sump stewards don't hesitate to use their strength to protect their domain, encouraging local plants to restrain and delay intruders. If lethal force is required, they can use their oversized farming implements as greatclubs and expel clouds of poisonous spores that functions as the cloudkill spell. Goblins and other underground races tend to avoid sump steward colonies, venturing into them only under dire circumstances.",
			"",
			"Arcano-botanists posit that all sump stewards are biological duplicates of one original organism, spreading asexually via their spores for thousands or millions of years all across Golarion. It is unknown how long an individual sump steward lives, but an elven explorer reported meeting the same sump steward 800 years apart. It's even possible that the original sump steward is still alive, tending to some remote colony to this day.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"Sump stewards are social creatures; a group of sump stewards is called a choir because they sing together. Every sump steward in a choir sings its own unique song, and when the voices come together, the subtly different melodies build upon one another in a haunting music that echoes throughout their domain. Sump stewards' social structures are intensely hierarchical. The eldest in a choir speaks for-and makes binding decisions for- every sump steward in the choir.",
			"",
			"Sump stewards live primarily underground or deep in primeval forests and swamps, although they can be found anywhere they can manage to grow their colonies. While a single sump steward might tend to a relatively small colony, a choir of sump stewards might have a domain that encompasses many square miles. These fungal forests have their own unique ecology: various slimes, jellies, and oozes make their home among the stalks of giant mushrooms, while large packs of fungal crawlers scamper along the floor. Giant slugs sometimes live within a colony, as they are attracted to and pacified by sump steward songs.",
			"",
			"Sump stewards have a longstanding but puzzling rivalry with treants. Entire choirs have been observed to travel far from their colonies to attack a treant grove, leaving their treasures and young sump stewards unguarded as they wage these attacks. Treants don't share this violent animosity, but they think poorly of sump stewards, likening them to parasites or blights on nature. The source of this intense enmity isn't clear; sump stewards and treants rarely inhabit the same areas, so they don't typically compete for resources. Sump stewards don't take much stock in what other creatures think of them, so it's unlikely that treants' dismissive attitude toward sump stewards is sufficient to generate this ire. Whatever the reason, sump stewards and treants never cooperate, and they usually come to blows if they encounter one another.",
			"",
			"### Notable Sump Stewards",
			"",
			"Sump stewards exist across Golarion, including the following locations.",
			"",
			"Kaer Maga: One of the most notable colonies of sump stewards is located under Kaer Maga, in the deep and mysterious chasm called Nursery Trench. This chasm is so choked with fungal growth that it is nearly impassable, although the form of an overgrown cathedral is barely visible at the chasm's lowest point. The choir of sump stewards in Nursery Trench is headed by a steward called Calando Mosswort. It's said that the cathedral Calando's choir guards holds secrets from before Earthfall.",
			"",
			"Mindspin Mountains: A sump steward known as Lichenback leads a choir in eastern Varisia. Dwarven traders occasionally pass through Lichenback's large colony in the Mindspin Mountains. Lichenback lets travelers pass if they give up a token, which the sump steward adds to an impressive collection of mementos in a collapsed tower choked with fungus.",
			"",
			"Fangwood: Fluge Darkwood leads an exceptionally large choir in the Fangwood Forest, near the strange blight that pervades the forest's heart. It's unknown if Fluge's choir has been corrupted by Arlantia, or if they simply find the blight more hospitable for rampant fungal growth. Rumors persist that the sump stewards' songs echoing through the Fangwood are paeans to the horrid god Cyth-V-sug."

			"#### Description",
			"",
			"Sun falcons are birds of omen in Osirion, with a reputation that goes back to the days of the nation's most ancient gods. In many myths and stories, sun falcons act as the eyes of many deities, though most commonly for Ra, who considers these birds to be among his holy creatures on Golarion. Sun falcons seem to watch over important people and oversee noteworthy events-sometimes from far enough away to be mistaken as a star visible during the day, sometimes from close enough to appear as a second sun. Today, the ancient gods are largely forgotten, but sun falcons still gravitate toward Osirion's heroes and pharaohs, suggesting that these abandoned gods are not so distant.",
			"",
			"A typical full-grown sun falcon weighs 2 to 3 pounds and measures 18 inches from beak to tail, with a wingspan approaching 5 feet.",
			"",
			"Scholars believe that the brilliant plumage of sun falcons wasn't a natural or even a magical evolution so much as it was divine gift, granted by Ra in the first days of these favored birds' existence. Ancient papyrus scrolls and carvings found in ruins claim the ancient gods of Osirion desired a way to inform mortals they were being observed, and so Ra created the first sun falcons from common desert falcons, imbuing them with his power to shine as bright as the desert sun so as to be seen across the land. This divine gift suffuses every feather on their bodies. Individual lost or stolen feathers shed light as a candle for up to 7 days after being detached, and are often in high demand to accent elegant attire for the upper class.",
			"",
			"Despite being creatures blessed with the heat of the sun, sun falcons are mortal and require normal sustenance to survive. To avoid reducing their captured prey to unpalatable ash, sun falcons vent gouts of fire from within, slowly lowering their body in temperature to a level that allows them to consume their meals without first incinerating them.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"Sun falcons live deep within the deserts of Osirion, though they aren't unknown in Thuvia or even as far west as Rahadoum. They build nests atop rocky outcroppings from gravel, pebbles, and shards of metal capable of withstanding their natural heat, but often abandon their nests only months after creation. How long a particular nest has been inhabited can be identified by the darkness of the rocks it is made from. The stones from particularly well-used nests may even have begun to fuse together from the heat, and are typically lined with crude glass formed from melted desert sand. Some enterprising folk collect these abandoned nests wherever they can be found, and sell them in bazaars throughout the desert lands. But as a typical sun falcon may build dozens if not hundreds of these nests over the course of its life, only the most heavily used or otherwise impressive nests have any real value.",
			"",
			"So long as a sun falcon remains in a particular nest, it ranges for hundreds of miles in search of prey, primarily desert rodents and other small birds, though they have occasionally been known to attack much larger prey. When fighting anything larger than itself, it begins the attack by making several passes close overhead, relying on its inborn radiance to scorch and exhaust its prey before diving in for the killing blow.",
			"",
			"Sun falcons are only aggressive when hunting or provoked. Most often, this provocation comes from opportunistic profiteers searching for abandoned nests or molted feathers. An aggravated sun falcon takes to the sky, and over the course of several days it might attack everything it sees-stranding travelers, setting caravans ablaze, and even drying up oases in its rage. When fighting, a sun falcon usually opens combat with its blinding flash ability to confound its victim's senses. Following this initial attack, the sun falcon keeps its distance and uses its breath weapon. It then uses Flyby Attack to strafe its target and remain out of the creature's grasp. If its fiery attacks don't seem to affect its victim, the sun falcon disengages from the fight and moves on.",
			"",
			"Sun falcons have few natural predators, and they are canny enough to easily avoid most mundane hunters. Their ability to fly protects them from most desert predators, and their natural talents with heat and fire help them fend off any other foolish creatures. The biggest threat to sun falcons comes from efreet who walk the deserts of northern Garund. Immune to many of the sun falcons' attacks, efreet hunt sun falcons for sport as if they were common pheasants, dining on the creatures and using their radiant plumage as decorations on their clothing and armor.",
			"",
			"The mating habits of sun falcons have long confounded scholars, as every member of the species ever examined has been a mature female, carrying a single already fertilized egg. Because of the birds' association with Ra, some postulate that these eggs are divinely fertilized, though sun falcons are capable of breeding with males of other falcon species, and the result of these unions is always a baby sun falcon. This method of reproduction creates slight variations in the appearance of offspring, but the creatures' abilities are the same.",
			"",
			"A sun falcon lays these eggs on an annual cycle, and each bird has its own cycle. It takes approximately a month for an egg to hatch once it has been laid, and a chick reaches full maturity after only 2 months. Sun falcons are often born already capable of flight. Until the chick matures, it hunts alongside its mother as she teaches the fledgling vital skills. After reaching maturity, the young sun falcon departs into the desert to build its first nest and begin its own cycle.",
			"",
			"The only exceptions to this rule are when a sun falcon bonds to another creature. The subject of this bond is typically a humanoid who is suspected to have some great destiny in store. A sun falcon doesn't live with its bonded creature or even have much direct contact, but it keeps nearby, flying above the village or city the person lives in or trailing the person in her travels if she happens to be a desert nomad or leaves her native lands. This bonding process has proven flawed as often as not in the current Age of Lost Omens-though the falcon follows this creature for the remainder of its life, the bonded person is no more likely to have a great future in store for him then might any other. While some skeptics claim that those who believe this legend grant such chosen individuals more chances than they would otherwise receive, artificially inflating their chance of success, others' beliefs also result in unrealistic expectations that these \"blessed\" individuals constantly fail to meet, which can lead them to instead despair or be rejected by the public."

They pride themselves on their pitilessness and inability to be bribed or dissuaded from ending a target's life once they've been contracted to do so. Once an assassination is paid for, it's the duty of all the svartalfars of a clan or cabal to make sure it gets done. If a clan or cabal fails, another one will finish the job.",
			"",
			"Svartalfars seem to feel no love or real friendship. All of their actions are committed for practical reasons-political gain, procreation, or relieving boredom. Focused and utterly unyielding, they are considered by many to be the perfect killers, and their tenacity and mastery over magic and shadows are a death sentence for anyone who has been marked as their quarry."
