		"A less invasive, but perhaps more painful, method of becoming a demon is the piecemeal transplanting of demonic elements into a mortal's body. By extracting a portion of a demon's body and then preparing it by utilizing various occult techniques or strange methods of preservation, one can reap a portion of the demon's power and transfer it into a sentient being. Demonic implants can either be temporary (and often addictive) drug-like magical elixirs, or they can be actual body parts that must be grafted onto or into a living mortal before they work. All are treated as wondrous items for the purposes of construction and use. The three examples listed below merely scratch the surface of this reckless category of magic item.",
		"",
		"All demonic implants require a willing host to attach them to-attempts to attach a demonic implant to an unwilling host automatically fail. Successfully attached demonic implants impart a negative level to a lawful or good user-the number of negative levels imparted stacks with each new implant. These negative levels remain as long as the implant remains attached or (in the case of demon blood) until the effects wear off. They never result in actual level loss, but cannot be overcome in any way while the implant is in effect.",
		"",
		"Implants must be physically excised to be removed. Removal inflicts 1d6 points of Constitution damage, and could have other effects as well (such as deafness or blindness) as determined by the GM."
