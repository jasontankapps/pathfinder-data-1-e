Whereas most divs turn their cruelty and vengefulness exclusively upon mortals, akvans broaden the scope of their hatred to encompass geniekind as well.",

While divs typically spread their taint through more subtle ways, akvans target symbols for destruction, bringing down not just stone and mortar but hopes and dreams. Additionally, these masters of destruction promote the creation of new horrors, transforming their most hated victims, genies, into nightmares known as ghuls. Thus, an akvan's evil does not end with its victim's death, as slain genies arise from the battlefield-or are belched up from an akvan's gullet-as blasphemous undead servants. These undead minions serve their terrifying master and, over the ages, gather around it as an army of profane slaves.",
			"",
			"Hatred and hunger for genies and those allied with them constitute the racial compulsion to which all akvans bow.

Even if a doru fails to fully corrupt an intelligent being itself, it attempts to weaken the target's will, making the victim more pliable to future corruption and ruin.",

Such bargains are usually what seal dorus to servitude, whether their service be to other divs or to mortal spellcasters. Cunning creatures, dorus often act as double (and sometimes triple) agents, but they rarely maintain this complex series of lies and deceptions for long. Dorus abhor mortals, as all divs do, and find it difficult to remain obedient to such beings for more than a span of a few decades at most. Only the most precious and profane secrets have the potential to keep a doru faithful to a mortal master for more than a century.",

Dorus' spell-like abilities make them excellent spies, granting them the ability to infiltrate, eavesdrop while invisible, and charm their way out of perilous situations. Those serving mortals pride themselves on manipulating their masters into furthering the divs' own ends. Many evil spellcasters seeking profane power and ancient evil secrets seek to take dorus as familiars.

Some scholars claim that in ancient times these creatures' interference caused numerous cultures to alter their practices regarding burial.",
			"",
			"When a druj nasu was found near a body that was to be buried, the body would be considered unclean. An unclean body couldn't be buried and the sacred flames of a funeral pyre would only spread the taint to the winds, so some ancient people would then carry the corpse up the side of a cliff or mountain and have the birds and other animals clean the flesh from the bones before the deceased could be interred with the necessary rites to ensure a proper passage into the Great Beyond.",
			"",
			"Unlike other corpse thieves, druj nasus don't take the bodies of the deceased in order to feast upon the rotting flesh. The divs do this to spite the survivors and bring greater grief and sorrow to the family and loved ones of the dead. After pilfering the bodies, the divs watch from afar as the grieving family sinks deeper into sadness. They then animate the stolen remains and, since they have no innate ability to influence these creations, use their command undead spell-like ability to send the shambling corpse back to prey upon its former loved ones. In this way, druj nasus disrupt polite society and commit one of the ultimate cultural taboos.",
			"",
			"Because druj nasus, like all divs, are a scourge on humanity's accomplishments, these foul fiends are a constant target of good faiths. They are particularly hated by followers of Pharasma because of their treatment of corpses and proclivity for animating the remains they steal. Druj nasus generally ignore Pharasmins, however, and instead focus on their own mockery of the living. Because of an unknown, ancient conflict in Kelesh, druj nasus have a strong hatred for Sarenrae and her worshipers, going so far as to single them out in combat and steal away the bodies of the clergy and faithful. Sarenrae's devoted find combating these divs frustrating due to their immunity to fire.",
			"",
			"A druj nasu stands roughly 6 feet tall and weighs a slight 100 pounds.",

Morticians and priests who are aware of the predations of these divs often keep dogs around to help ward off the fiends. Though druj nasus have no weakness against the sun, these divs tend to do their hunting at night when there are fewer watchful eyes.",
			"",
			"In combat, druj nasus use their droning ability to weaken and incapacitate their enemies, and then summon swarms of biting insects to wash over them, often doing so under the protection of invisibility. Once their foes are subjected to the distracting nature of the swarms, the div closes into melee range, taking full advantage of its swarmwalking ability. Against enemies that outnumber them or are more powerful, the divs make great use of flyby attacks, often paired with invisibility, to keep out of reach.",

			"Druj nasus make their home in Abaddon, but, like most divs, they visit the Material Plane whenever they have the chance so that they can wreck the accomplishments and creations of humankind. These divs are most plentiful in Katapesh, Kelesh, Qadira, and Thuvia, but they can be found anywhere in the world. Druj nasus favor desert climates, but they don't spend much time in the open deserts, choosing instead to stick to places where people throng and plenty of dead bodies can be found and corrupted. These divs tend to stick to the outskirts of larger settlements, typically where the burial sites are located.",
			"",
			"In regions where a druj nasu takes up residence, undead are a particular problem. These uncontrolled undead roam the countryside causing strife and danger to the area's inhabitants. These cruels divs also haunt nearby communities. They hide using their invisibility spell-like ability and spoil people's stores of food and communal water wells using their putrefy food and drink spell-like ability. For communities with large stores of food and drink, divs continuously return until the settlements are on the verge of starvation. Druj nasus also use this ability to taint holy water fonts found in temples and shrines. These divs delight in sending plagues of insects to swarm through fields and towns to harass those living nearby.",
			"",
			"Typically, druj nasus are loners, but they sometimes work in small groups to achieve a task before disbanding and going their respective ways. They are not particularly opposed to working with other divs, but when they do so they get along the best with pairakas, with whom they share a desire to spread disease and personal strife.",
			"",
			"On the Material Plane, ghuls frequently inhabit the same kinds of spaces that druj nasus haunt. This leads the two creatures to compete over the theft of corpses; more often than not, such conflicts are won by the divs. Since divs can tolerate the burning rays of the sun better than ghuls, these divs gain a greater advantage in successfully stealing corpses."

			"**Change Shape (Su)** A doppeldrek's change shape ability allows it to take the form of a living creature that it senses with its blindsight ability. Although a doppeldrek is normally mindless, its skill at mimicry is sufficient to reproduce intelligence. While it maintains the shape of a creature with 1 or 2 Intelligence, it gains an Intelligence score of that value. If it mimics a creature with a higher intelligence, the doppeldrek still only gains an Intelligence score of 2. When a doppeldrek gains an Intelligence score, it gains skill ranks equal to its Hit Dice, which it always places in the Disguise skill. This ability otherwise functions as normal for change shape. If the doppeldrek takes the shape of an aberration, animal, dragon, magical beast, or vermin, it gains any of the creature's abilities listed in beast shape IV. If it takes the shape of a fey, humanoid, or monstrous humanoid, it instead gains any of the creature's abilities listed in monstrous physique IV. Finally, if it takes the shape of a plant, it gains any of the creature's abilities listed in plant shape III. A doppeldrek can't mimic other oozes, nor can it mimic constructs, outsiders, or undead.",
			"",
			"#### Description",

			"In their natural form, doppeldreks are pale blobs, with an appearance akin to sea foam. However, doppeldreks habitually mimic other creatures that they detect with their blindsense, taking on not only their shapes but also some of their innate abilities, and even some of their intelligence. A doppeldrek using its change shape ability believes itself to be whatever type of creature it is currently mimicking, and its behavior matches the behavior typical of that type of creature, as far as its intelligence allows. When a doppeldrek attempts to copy a creature with substantially greater intelligence, such as the average humanoid, it attempts to follow the creature around, constantly copying its behavior and making vocalizations that are too imprecise to be recognizable as speech. An isolated doppeldrek eventually reverts to its natural form.",
			"",
			"Occasionally, through exposure to potent magic or other means, a doppeldrek gains a persistent intelligence and personality, becoming an awakened doppeldrek. An awakened doppeldrek possesses an Intelligence score of 6 or higher, and can use its change shape ability to mimic an Intelligence score up to double its own. An awakened doppeldrek must still put a number of skill ranks equal to its Hit Dice in Disguise, but can allocate its other skill ranks as it sees fit each time it assumes a new form."

Younger doppelgangers practice their skills by taking over small orc or goblin tribes, then move to more complicated societies like dwarven, elven, and human communities. Rather than making themselves targets by taking positions of leadership, they prefer to be the power behind the throne, or use multiple identities to manipulate influential citizens or entire guilds.",
			"",
			"Doppelgangers make excellent use of their natural mimicry to stage ambushes, bait traps, and infiltrate humanoid society. Although not usually evil, they are interested only in themselves and regard all others as playthings to be manipulated and deceived. They are particularly fond of invading human societies in order to indulge in their desires-some enjoy the complex dance of politics while others seek constant change in the race and gender of both themselves and their romantic companions. While not standard, it is those doppelgangers use their gifts for cruel and sadistic purposes that are most notorious, and these shapeshifters are the primary cause of the race's sinister reputation. Certainly, a creature capable of changing its shape has a handy way to avoid capture for its crimes, and some particularly malicious doppelgangers enjoy disrupting relationships by posing as unfaithful lovers.",
			"",
			"Rumors persist of even more powerful doppelgangers capable of not only shifting their appearance, but also skills, memories, and even the extraordinary and supernatural abilities of creatures whose forms they choose to mimic. These doppelgangers' change shape ability functions like the spell polymorph rather than alter self."

Black dragons prefer treasures that do not rot or decay, making their hoard, full of coins, gemstones, jewelry, and other objects made from stone or metal.",

			"Desert Thirst (Su) A blue dragon can cast create water at will (CL equals its HD). Alternatively, it can destroy an equal amount of liquid in a 10-foot burst. Unattended liquids are instantly reduced to sand. Liquid-based magic items (such as potions) and items in a creature's possession must succeed on a Will save or be destroyed. The save DC is Charisma-based. Electricity Aura (Su) An adult blue dragon is surrounded by an aura of electricity. Creatures within 5 feet take 1d6 points of electricity damage at the beginning of the dragon's turn. An old dragon's aura extends to 10 feet. An ancient dragon's damage increases to 2d6. Mirage (Su) An old or older blue dragon can make itself appear to be in two places at once as a free action for a number of rounds per day equal to its Hit Dice. This ability functions as project image but the dragon can use its breath weapon through the mirage. Sandstorm (Su) As a standard action, a great wyrm blue dragon can create a sandstorm centered on itself with a radius of 1,200 feet. Creatures other than the dragon inside the storm take 2d6 points of damage per round in addition to the normal sandstorm penalties. This sandstorm lasts for up to 1 hour, but can be dismissed by the dragon as a free action. Sound Imitation (Ex) A very young or older blue dragon can mimic any voice or sound it has heard by making a successful Bluff check against a listener's Sense Motive check. Spell-Like Abilities (Sp) A blue dragon gains the following spell-like abilities, usable at will upon reaching the listed age category. Young-ghost sound; Juvenile-minor image; Adult-ventriloquism; Old-hallucinatory terrain; Ancient-veil; Great wyrm-mirage arcana. Storm Breath (Su) An ancient or older blue dragon can use its breath weapon to create a storm of lightning. This functions as call lightning storm, but the damage is equal to the dragon's breath weapon. The dragon can call down 1 bolt per round as a free action for 1d6 rounds. The save DC is equal to the dragon's breath weapon DC. Additional uses of this ability extend the duration by an additional 1d6 rounds.",

			"Related to pseudodragons, faerie dragons are whimsical, playful pranksters that spend most of their time either relaxing in cool forest glades or engaged in some sort of prank. Although such mischief is usually spontaneous, some faerie dragons have been known to spend months or even years in preparation of one truly spectacular joke.Travelers making their way through lands known to be inhabited by these good-natured-but sometimes annoying-tricksters are advised to keep up their guard lest they face all manner of creative annoyances (horses painted with berry juice, squirrels placed inside bedrolls, and clothing decorating high branches being a few examples).",
			"",
			"Unlike true dragons, faerie dragons do not grow larger with age, but their scales do change color, starting with red and moving through the rainbow to reach dark violet at old age. Faerie dragons grow in power as spellcasters as they age (typically gaining levels in sorcerer), learning more powerful spells to complement their innate abilities. The spells of faerie dragons tend to focus on tools that can be used to create or enhance pranks, and illusion and enchantment spells are particularly popular.",
			"",
			"Faerie dragons avoid combat unless there is no other option. If forced to fight, faerie dragons attempt to confound enemies rather than kill them, using both spells and breath weapon to weaken and scatter foes before fleeing. The only exception to this is when a faerie dragon's clan or allies are in danger. As capricious as these tiny dragons can be, many prove quick to bond with goodly creatures, especially fey and others they find interesting or hilarious-adventurers often fall into this latter camp, particularly those most outraged by a faerie dragon's tricks.",
			"",
			"Faerie dragons sometimes ally with spellcasters, serving as curious, occasionally reckless, but always true familiars. An arcane spellcaster of at least 7th level with an alignment within 1 step of chaotic good who has the Improved Familiar feat may select a faerie dragon as a familiar."

			"",
			"Hailing from an unknown location in the Great Beyond, prism dragons delight in manipulation for its own sake, shaping mortal societies and the world around them for little more than the fun doing so offers, distracting themselves from the tedium of ageless existence. Most prism dragons view humanoid creatures as parts of their hoard, as treasured and precious as any gem or goblet. Gifted with potent psychic abilities and the power to generate and warp illusions, prism dragons gravitate toward mastermind roles, and prefer to claim territories that overlap with complicated cultures-large cities, trade routes, and monster-infested ruins-where they can scheme and coax other intelligent creatures to dance to a particular tune. Prism dragons adore overelaborate schemes-not because they expect victory, but because complication gives so many things a chance to go wrong, allowing the dragons to test their quick wits and adaptability in addition to their planning skills. They detest physical confrontation, and only engage in it when left with no other recourse or when troublesome humanoids spoil their games. Chaos and change keep eternity exciting, but prismatic dragons are sore losers.",
			"",
			"Prism dragons dislike undisguised truths, as they consider relating unvarnished facts to be boring and beneath them. As such, they rarely reveal themselves for what they are, even among cultures such as kobolds that revere dragons. For a prism dragon to reveal its true self is a sign of respect, but even then, the dragon is unlikely to communicate in a straightforward manner, feeling that doing so would be insulting the intelligence of its conversational partner. Prism dragons are fond of using illusions to appear as powerful visitors, or possessing long-standing members of the community and using their hosts' resources to begin shaping their new homes to their liking. Their sense of fair play compels them to get permission from a host before possessing it, but a host who has answered an innocuous-seeming question from a stranger in the affirmative or nodded in agreement with a statement made by another patron at the local tavern is often unaware that she has consented. Indeed, whether permission has been received via the means many prism dragons employ is often a distinction without a difference to anyone else. Prism dragons view their inability to shapeshift as a special challenge, and no two members of their kind deal with this handicap the same way-a rare few use polymorph magic, but more commonly they rely on invisibility or subterfuge, or hide in plain sight by posing as exotic statuary while using their psychic abilities to coax their playthings to action. Eventually, they reshape alliances between groups of monsters or stir up courtly intrigue, leading to squabbling, infighting, and even war. Many prismatic dragons lair in the rubble of cities they claim to have ruined in ages long past.",
			"",
			"As solitary creatures, prism dragons avoid one another. Though conflicts over territory are common, the haughty beasts never deign to battle each other in vulgar combat. Instead, the dragons wage intricate proxy wars against each other to settle bizarre wagers-betting that one of the dragons can get a certain nation to invade another, or that the other dragon can convince a king to willingly throw away his crown-or else concoct elaborate schemes to expose each other as impostors. Whatever the outlandish victory conditions of the contest, one rule is always in force: the draconic opponents can't take a direct hand in the events, and can act only through proxies and agents. This leads to complicated webs of intrigue that develop over years or even decades as the dragons' plots gradually come to fruition. The dragons, who are as fascinated by the behavioral patterns of intelligent creatures as they are by the scintillating patterns of light on treasure, find these contests immensely enjoyable, even despite the high (and sometimes deadly) stakes. They are not completely without the capacity for sympathy, however, and may make recompense to one who argues eloquently enough.",
			"",
			"A prism dragon maintains its hoard carefully, though its system might not seem apparent to others at first. The puzzle-loving dragons invariably catalog their hoards (and any associated traps hidden therein) in some clever way, and looting a defeated prism dragon's hoard without this master document can be as dangerous as facing the dragon itself. For example, traps in a prism dragon's lair might deactivate only when the dragon stands in a certain spot and refracts the light in just the right way. Other prism dragons might organize their treasure by color, but lay traps based on aura, rather than physical hues, fooling self-congratulatory adventurers who have no way of detecting the pattern.",
			"",
			"Planar travelers report prism dragons on the Material Plane, the Astral Plane, the Ethereal Plane, and in lesser numbers across the Outer Planes, but to date none have reported young or infant versions of these shimmering beasts. Prism dragons themselves claim to be immortal- primeval dragons spawned at the dawn of the multiverse and serving as Apsu's template to create the other, \"lesser\" draconic races. True dragons dispute this origin, and given prism dragons' grandiose claims in all other affairs, this story likely bears little more than a grain of truth. Prism dragons share no apparent family connection to the crystal dragons of the Elemental Plane of Earth, despite their outward resemblance to them.",

			"A fully grown prism dragon is 25 feet long and weighs more than 13,000 pounds."

			"",
			"#### Description",
			"",
			"Aquatic dragons similar in size and fickleness to faerie dragons and pseudodragons, tidepool dragons rule as whimsical tyrants over miniature realms comprising coral forests, sand dune mountains, and low-tide menageries. Preferring to inhabit coastal regions throughout the world's warmer climes, these dragon-kin make their lairs amid balmy lagoons and hidden coves, favoring any seaside setting devoid of stronger predators. A combination of chitinous shell-similar in shade to that of a blue crab-and scales the color of clear tropical waters covers every tidepool dragon, the shade deepening through twilight hues to a shade as dark as a ocean abyss.",
			"",
			"Tidepool dragons typically measure about 2 feet long and weigh approximately 14 pounds. They are known to live for about 300 years.",
			"",
			"Despite their size, tidepool dragons are hardy and well suited to their environment. Their sweeping fin-wings work equally well both above and beneath the water. While underwater, these dragons use their fins to make languid, powerful strokes, propelling them forward in graceful bursts, but the strong, flexible musculature beneath the fins also allows them to make quick, dramatic turns essential in pursing eels, small fish, and other agile prey. Above the water these same appendages work like wings, the membranous skin spreading over bones and cartilage to catch currents of air. Many observers who have glimpsed these creatures both above and below the waves claim that they do not fly so much as swim through the skies. The tiny dragons' dense muscle mass, particularly in their tails, allows them to create momentum strong enough to break the surface of the water and send them skyward in their characteristic glides. Although they prefer to eat fish, tidepool dragons often use their flight to chase seabirds off the surface of the waves and high into the sky, while the small, tough teeth that line every tidepool dragon's mouth can easily crack the hard shells of crabs and other shellfish.",
			"",
			"The tidepool dragon is amphibious, possessing both gills and lungs, and can exist outside of water indefinitely. While it is in flight, muscles stretch its gill slits so they lie flat along the body, decreasing resistance to the wind. At the apex of the dragon's complex respiratory system, near the base of the creature's throat, a pair of small bones hang down. Tidepool dragons can vibrate these bones at an almost unthinkable speed, and the furious motion gives off intense heat. They can then draw water through their bodies from their gills and push it out of their mouths. As this torrent of water passes the vibrating bones, it heats to temperatures beyond scalding, capable of burning flesh and even melting glass. Even when not submerged, tidepool dragons can draw moisture from the air through their gills to power their breath weapons. But despite the potency of a tidepool dragon's breath when used in flight or on land, these creatures usually employ their breath weapons while underwater. When the dragons are submerged, their scalding gout of water diffuses into a small cloud of boiling water, allowing them to affect entire schools of fish or other groups of prey in a single boiling burst.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"Tidepool dragons get their name from their tendency to frequent small coastal pools, where they bask and sleep because they are usually safe from other predators there and their shell-like hides blend well with the brilliant colors of local aquatic fauna. Those attempting to capture or otherwise contain a tidepool dragon find it a challenging task, as the creature's freedom of movement ability makes most nets, ropes, and simple attempts to grab it near useless. \"Slippery as a tide wyrm\" is a phrase often bandied about by sailors and other seafarers when trying to cross treacherously wet decks or wrestle the rigging of a loose and blowing sail.",
			"",
			"Despite being almost impossible to catch, tidepool dragons can be bargained with rather readily, as their interests, while fickle, are quite simple. Those seeking tidepool dragons' favor-or, at least, hoping not to incur their mischief-can make offerings to the dragon, typically in the form of coins, gems, or particularly shiny shells so that the miniature wyrms can mimic their larger kin. Additionally, most tidepool dragons enjoy rare fish that cannot be found in their home waters, or fruits and vegetables from far inland that they've never sampled.",
			"",
			"Capricious and self-serving, these miniature dragons possess a less savory reputation than their faerie dragon or pseudodragon cousins, making enemies as easily as they make allies. Highly territorial, most tidepool dragons take offense if the waters and coasts near their lairs are intruded upon, blasting trespassers with their breath weapons or perpetrating various pranks upon them. If satisfied, though-typically by being bribed with shiny baubles or salty food-tidepool dragons can prove quite helpful, serving other creatures for the promise of more rewards. Clever sailors have been known to leave trails of enticing foods in their ships' wakes in an effort to draw the attention of tidepool dragons. If successful, a vessel can gain a valuable helper, capable of acting as a lookout both far above and far below the water. Several aquatic species, such as merfolk, tritons, aquatic elves, and even sahuagin, also recognize the benefits of keeping tidepool dragons as allies, and some explorers have recorded colonies of such aquatic humanoids where well-fed clutches of these dragons act as sentries or scouts.",
			"",
			"When left to their own devices, tidepool dragons live in small coastal caves, usually in mated pairs or related family clutches. These lairs always contain exit shafts into the sky beyond since tidepool dragon eggs and new hatchlings are a favorite prey of bunyips. Tidepool dragon eggs are about the size of a chicken or crocodile egg, but are marked with the same colors that will eventually grace the hatchlings' scales. Parents hatch their young and then raise them until they are capable of surviving on their own, around age 3. At that point, young tidepool dragons set off to find mates and indulge their species' rampant curiosity. Single youths also band together to form non-familial pods for hunting and adventure.",
			"",
			"### Tidepool Dragons as Familiars",
			"",
			"Although difficult to approach, tidepool dragons sometimes choose to serve as the familiars of unruly spellcasters and those who go out of their way to feed them rich or exotic foods. Spellcasters of 7th level or higher with an alignment within one step of chaotic neutral can gain a tidepool dragon as a familiar by taking the Improved Familiar feat."
