			"The Bluff skill is an extremely versatile, though sometimes misunderstood, social skill. Unlike Diplomacy and Intimidate, which can directly push their target toward a course of action, Bluff feeds the target misinformation. A skilled user of the Bluff skill needs to understand how the target's mind works, in order to deliver just the right misinformation to achieve the desired results. The disadvantage is that such manipulation is less predictable and more difficult to pull off, but the advantage is that the target is not aware that he is being manipulated, whereas even the most successful Diplomacy or Intimidate attempt leaves the target realizing who has convinced him to take action. This section includes clarifications and details on several different ways to use Bluff-and on several things that don't work."

			"Deceiving people is the most prominent use of the Bluff skill, making it one of the trickiest skills to adjudicate.",
			"",
			"***Bluff Doesn't Define a Response:*** Even the most successful lie told using Bluff doesn't determine the course of action the deceived person takes-it just primes the target with misinformation. This means attempts to trick a creature into a course of action might need to also include Diplomacy or Intimidate after the Bluff check. For example, suppose there was a guard with the following orders from the guard captain: \"Don't let anyone into the restricted area without clearance papers, even if it seems to be me or someone of higher rank.\" After this, a sneaky rogue attempts the following ruse: \"I am the king's general on a mission of utmost importance for national security. I need you to let me in now, or you're fired!\" Assuming the rogue succeeds at her Bluff check, the guard now believes her to be the general, but this doesn't mean he will let her through. His orders still require him to keep everyone out without papers. The last part of the rogue's demand is an attempt to Intimidate the guard, and the successful Bluff check was a necessary prerequisite to even attempt the Intimidate check.",
			"",
			"***Circumstances:*** When using Bluff to tell a lie, the Core Rulebook table on possible circumstance modifiers takes into account several levels of plausibility, targets who want to believe or are impaired, and possession of convincing proof, but there are also plenty of other circumstances that might affect the result of a Bluff check. For instance, many people strongly don't want to believe a bluff that would lead to cognitive dissonance, such as attempting to convince a true believer that their religion is fake, and such a lie imposes a -5 penalty on the attempt (the opposite of a target who wants to believe the falsehood). On the other hand, a target who is afraid that the deceit is actually correct might grant a +2 bonus or more on the skill check, depending on the level of anxiety about the fabrication. For instance, a bigoted assassin who is afraid that half-orcs are cannibals might be more likely to believe a half-orc's bluff that she ate the target he was supposed to kill.",
			"",
			"There are a variety of other circumstances, all of which might alter the odds in different directions. A character with a widespread reputation of being a compulsive liar might take a large penalty on his skill check, but a character with a reputation for always telling the truth, such as a paladin, would gain a large bonus on her skill check. Similarly, a hostile creature is much less likely to believe a deception, whereas a helpful creature is much more likely to believe one.",
			"",
			"***Tricking Someone:*** Bluff can be used to cleverly trip a target up and get him to reveal something or make a mistake. In these cases, he realizes his mistake soon after, but by then it is too late, and the falsehood has done its damage. This is similar to using Bluff to feint or create a distraction, but has broader applications in social situations. For instance, suppose a swashbuckler suspected that an assassin works for the queen. The swashbuckler might be able to trick the assassin into revealing more information by pretending to be a fellow agent of the queen in an attempt to gauge the assassin's response. Of course, if the assassin doesn't work for the queen and sees through the ruse, he might attempt his own Bluff check to pretend that he works for the queen and fell for the trick, thus causing the swashbuckler to investigate the innocent queen.",
			"",
			"***Conspirators and the Spokesperson:*** Sometimes, a group of individuals has a single spokesperson tell a convincing lie while the others just pray that the target doesn't notice them chuckling in the background with their inability to pull off a successful bluff. Though this tactic might succeed against a complacent target, a competent target cognizant of the possibility of being deceived should attempt a Sense Motive check opposed by the Bluff check of at least a few of the other individuals, perhaps directing specific follow-up questions their way, or even just try to get a hunch about the others.",
			"",
			"***Plausibility:*** The Core Rulebook mentions that some lies are implausible enough that no matter how high a character's Bluff check, a PC can't convince a target that they are true. However, the same page also presents a table that says that \"impossible\" lies impart a -20 penalty on the skill check. This table's entry might actually be better described as \"particularly implausible.\" For example, an older human woman telling a very similar-looking human girl that she is herself from the future might take the -20 penalty, whereas a 10-year-old half-elf telling a 40-year-old orc the same lie would automatically fail the Bluff check.",
			"",
			"***Frequency of Bluff Checks:*** When a PC is attempting to con someone for an extended period of time rather than telling just one lie, how often should the GM call for new Bluff checks? This is important, since every new Bluff check is an opportunity for the opposition to attempt new Sense Motive checks and uncover the lie. The frequency of checks can be highly variable, and the GM is the ultimate arbiter, but some guidelines can be helpful. Requiring a new check for every individual statement that is a lie would bog down the game. In general, one Bluff check per new topic makes sense. If a new statement has different circumstances (particularly if it is less believable than the previous ones), it calls for a new Bluff check.",
			"",
			"For example, a character might claim to have been to an ancient dungeon. If his Bluff check succeeds, the opposition takes it for granted that the character went there, and basic details such as when the character went or how she got there don't require a new check. However, if she says she found a famous, long-lost artifact within the dungeon or traveled to the dungeon on the back of a roc, she will need to make a new check for the new topic or greater exaggeration. Maintaining a facade once a lie has been established usually doesn't require a new check. If a character is pretending to be a tax inspector and has succeeded at the initial attempt to Bluff, it isn't necessary to make him roll a Bluff check every time he says anything that is true for a tax inspector but a lie for the real character.",
			"",
			"***You're Not Lying, You're Just Wrong:*** Sometimes a character is a convincing enough liar that targets can't tell the character is lying, even when the targets possess incontrovertible proof that what the character is saying isn't true, or the lie is otherwise too unbelievable to be possible. In this case, one way to resolve the situation is for the bluffing character to take a -20 penalty on the skill check, and if she beats the target's Sense Motive, then the target believes that the bluffing character isn't lying, but is simply mistaken. This could also be the result of other situations in which the target of the Bluff attempt has strong reasons to believe that the falsehood, despite being plausible, isn't factually correct. Even this result can be useful to the bluffing character, as it doesn't mark her as a liar, and it allows her to gather information about what her target knows and expects.",
			"",
			"***True Lies and Implausible Truths:*** Bluff is the skill that convinces someone that something is true. However, there are a few potential cases when the situation isn't as straightforward as a bluffing character telling a lie to a target. For instance, suppose that the bluffing character makes up a believable lie to tell the target, and the lie turns out to be true, unbeknown to the bluffing character. If the Bluff check succeeded, the target is convinced, and might later verify the truth and trust the bluffing character more. However, what if the bluffing character fails? In this case, the target can tell that the bluffing character is lying, but that doesn't necessarily mean that the target is forced to conclude that the information is false. For instance, suppose a popular king has fallen into a magical, unbreakable sleep. A charlatan, noticing the king's lack of public appearances, makes up a story about the king being placed under a sleeping curse and spreads it around the tavern, but his Bluff check is terrible, and everyone can tell he's making it up. If one of the king's advisors is present in the tavern, this doesn't mean that the advisor now thinks the king isn't in a coma; it just means that she can tell the charlatan doesn't believe his own story. The reverse side of true lies is implausible truths. These are situations in which someone is telling the truth (either saying something that is actually true, or spreading a lie that they believe to be true), but that truth is extremely implausible to the listener. Though the bluffing character isn't lying, the same skill set that makes an excellent and convincing liar could potentially help characters attempting to spread an implausible truth. In these cases, even if the target succeeds at the Sense Motive check, he can tell that the bluffing character truly believes what she is saying, and he might simply conclude that she isn't lying, but simply mistaken. The target might later be swayed if presented with evidence or through a [verbal duel](rule/verbal_duels). If a bluffing character successfully convinces a target of a lie and the target attempts to spread that information, this leads to a classic example of an implausible truth.",
			"",
			"***Aftermath:*** While most of the Bluff rules focus on the scene between the bluffing character and the target, it is important to consider what happens afterward- especially in an intrigue-based campaign. Though true masters of deception might be able to pull off a bluff such that no one is ever the wiser, in the case of most successful bluffs, the targets eventually discover new information that allows them to realize the truth of the matter. In this case, their attitude toward the bluffing character generally decreases by one step (or simply becomes unfriendly), depending on the previous attitude and the severity of the bluff's consequences. Furthermore, if the bluffing character attempts to lie to such a target again, her Bluff check takes a similar penalty as if she had failed to deceive the target (either a -10 penalty, or the skill check might be impossible, at the GM's discretion).",
			"",
			"***Lies upon Lies:*** The aftermath of a Bluff becomes even more complicated if someone else attempts to make a contradictory lie, either in the same scene as the original prevarication or afterwards. If the bluffing characters are present together, it might be a good time to have them enter a verbal duel, with the target as the audience. However, this isn't possible when the second Bluff attempt happens after the first deceiving character is gone but before the target discovers the ruse. In this case, the second bluffing character has an advantage. She might be able to show proof that the first character was lying in order to build up the credibility of her own lie. If the second bluffing character beats the target's Sense Motive, but does not debunk the original lie or beat the first bluffing character's original Bluff check, then the target will likely be confused and unlikely to act on either piece of information. Or, the target might conclude that the second bluffer believes what she said but is misinformed."

			"In addition to being used for lying, the Bluff skill has several other uses defined in the rules.",
			"",
			"***Creating a Diversion:*** You can attempt a Bluff check to create a diversion to allow you to use Stealth, even a misdirection as simple as saying, \"What's that behind you\"? In the Core Rulebook, this usage is only mentioned off-handedly in the Stealth skill description, with no reference to its action type. Creating a distraction is a standard action.",
			"",
			"***Secret Messages and Intrigue:*** Don't underestimate the benefit of using Bluff to send messages through innuendo. Since the DC to send a message is static (15 or 20 depending on the message's complexity), you can quickly reach the point that the message itself is reliable, and thus the only risk is being intercepted, which would have happened anyway if you didn't make the attempt.",
			"",
			"***Surprise:*** Not every surprise round begins with an ambush from unseen assailants. If a character or several characters unexpectedly attack in the midst of a conversation or other normal activity, their victims might be surprised. To determine if a victim is surprised, he should attempt a Sense Motive check opposed by the assailant's Bluff check rather than a Perception opposed by the assailant's Stealth check. This is also a good way to adjudicate several abilities, including several vigilante talents that trigger when the target thinks the vigilante is an ally.",
			"",
			"***Maintaining a Disguise:*** When maintaining a disguise, the Bluff skill isn't necessary to correctly portray things such as mannerisms or facial expressions, but it will almost certainly come up when the disguised character makes statements in his assumed persona as he talks about events he didn't actually experience. Of course, a well-prepared character has thoroughly researched his disguise, so he is unlikely to take any penalties to his Bluff attempts."

			"Due to its ability to convince people without using either deception or coercion-and risking their negative consequences-the Diplomacy skill is one of the most commonly used forms of persuasion in the Pathfinder RPG. However, it is also difficult to adjudicate in a variety of situations involving intrigue and combat.",
			"",
			"The most consequential use of the Diplomacy skill is to change the attitudes of other creatures and to get them to comply with requests you make.",
			"",
			"***Attitude Adjustments, Personality, and Goals:*** One major trap in understanding the Diplomacy skill is the mistaken idea that attitude adjustments achieved using Diplomacy change a character's underlying personality and goals. In fact, attitude adjustments are minor good impressions (or bad impressions, in the case of a disastrously failed check) that, per the Core Rulebook, last only a few hours by default. At the GM's discretion, the adjustments may last for shorter or longer periods, depending on the circumstances. As such, a Diplomacy check to change someone's attitude is mainly useful as a prelude to a follow-up request. It doesn't alter the creature's personality or goals.",
			"",
			"For instance, if a cunning bard managed to convince the evil necromancer queen to become friendly with him, that doesn't mean she will give up plans of world domination or change her deity from the goddess of undead to the goddess of beauty and love, but it does mean that she likes the bard now. Even without further requests, she would probably spare him if he pledges loyalty to her and if she thinks she can trust him. Even if she feels she can't trust him, she might at least be fond enough of him to transform him into a loyal undead servant so she can keep him around. Attempting to convince the necromancer queen to give up her evil ways and cease her plans for world conquest involves much more than a Diplomacy check to change her attitude toward the bard. The bard would then need to use the [influence system](rule/influence) or the [relationship system](rule/relationships) to become closer to the necromancer queen, perhaps engaging in a [verbal duel](rule/verbal_duels) with her or even focusing an entire series of social adventures around changing her perspective (see [Social Conflicts](rule/social_conflicts)).",
			"",
			"***Requests Are Not Mind Control:*** This is the biggest potential trap in understanding the Diplomacy skill in a typical game. Diplomacy's main strength is the ability to make requests without angering the target, but that doesn't mean that it works like mind control. As the Core Rulebook says, some requests automatically fail if they go against a creature's values or nature. In this vein, it is important to remember that no matter how high a Diplomacy roll may be, the target still has free will and won't accept certain requests. Even so, a character who declines a very high Diplomacy result should do so respectfully, as the high result means that the diplomat made her argument effectively and convincingly. For instance, a paladin who swore an oath to never unseal the inner catacombs of her faith's central cathedral might apologize and explain that though the argument to do so was convincing, she unfortunately can't violate this vow. A target who must refuse a request might try to honor the request in spirit, offering an alternative that might advance the same greater goal or doing a significant but still lesser favor for the requester.",
			"",
			"***Roleplaying and Skills:*** As you can see from the sections above, as well as the table of potential circumstances in the Core Rulebook, the nature of a request is crucial to determining its success or failure. Therefore, it is necessary to describe the request in order to attempt a Diplomacy check. A diplomat's player can't just say \"I Diplomacy the guard.\" The player must provide a specific request along with any rationale supporting that desire, even if the player or GM doesn't want to roleplay the whole interaction in character. On the other hand, using Diplomacy to improve a target's attitude is both more open-ended and less fraught with circumstance modifiers, so when strapped for time or out of ideas, it is fine to omit a description of how a diplomat manages to do so. Using the previous example of the bard and the necromancer queen, the bard's request to spare a peasant so that she may spread word of the queen's mighty army and cause other villages to surrender without a fight is quite a different situation than him saying, \"Spare this peasant woman because killing her is evil and makes my goddess sad,\" or even \"Spare this peasant woman for me. Please\"?",
			"",
			"***Gathering Information:*** The Diplomacy skill allows a character to canvass locations for information. Because this use of Diplomacy often produces similar results to those of a high Knowledge (local) check, adventurers might be able to attempt either one to gain the same information. In fact, adventures occasionally present a table of facts that either skill can uncover. Gathering information with Diplomacy actually involves spending 1d4 hours actively seeking the information and allows the character to retry the attempt to pick up additional information. When a PC fails at a Knowledge (local) check, the GM can give the character a second chance by having him spend time attempting to gather that information from others.",
			"",
			"As per the Core Rulebook, some information is simply impossible to find via gathering information. The information that people know is typically limited to the area where they live, and is filtered through their biases. In a city on the brink of a race war between elves and humans, the information available among the upperclass human nobility will have a significantly different spin and tone to it than the information available in the elven ghetto, and the checks to gather information in those places would meet with circumstance bonuses or penalties depending on who was asking where. Thus, it is important to decide where a character is gathering information before determining what information they receive. Filtering the information through the biases of the community adds flavor and nuance to the world around the characters.",
			"",
			"Finally, remember that gathering information is itself a conspicuous act, so others who are gathering information can usually notice it in turn. A typical DC for hearing about someone else gathering information should start at 15, and a character wishing to gather information clandestinely can choose to take a penalty on her Diplomacy check to increase that DC by the same amount.",
			"",
			"***Calling for a Cease-Fire:*** One of the first things that a potential diplomat might try in a combat is to call for a temporary cease-fire. The description of the Diplomacy skill in the Core Rulebook indicates that requests take 1 round or longer, and that shifting attitudes takes 1 minute. Since a cease-fire is a type of request, this would work fine, with the diplomat making the request over the course of a full round of combat and completing it just before her next turn. However, a character can usually only make requests of a target that feels at least indifferent toward that character, and the vast majority of battles involve characters that are unfriendly or hostile toward each other.",
			"",
			"In this case, and in other instances of requests made to unfriendly or hostile characters, the GM should consider only allowing such requests that are couched in such a way that they seem to be in the target's best interests. An unfriendly or hostile character certainly isn't going to be doing the would-be diplomat any favors, but that doesn't mean they will ignore an idea that is better for them than facing the consequences of the combat. Even if adversaries agree to a brief cease-fire to listen to the diplomat's terms, they won't let their guard down. Generally, they will also require the side calling for the cease-fire to make a show of their intentions by laying down or sheathing their weapons, dropping spell component pouches, or the like, while attempting Sense Motive checks to determine if the cease-fire is a ruse. Creatures that feel themselves to be at an advantage in the combat by virtue of a short-duration spell or other effect that would expire during a cease-fire almost never agree to a cease-fire, as it isn't in their best interest to do so."

			"The uses of the Disguise skill are far more specific than those of Bluff and Diplomacy. The Disguise skill exists to allow characters to conceal their identity and to potentially pose as other characters.",
			"",
			"***Not Always Opposed:*** The most important thing to note about the Disguise skill is that characters do not automatically get a Perception check to oppose it. Per the Core Rulebook, an opponent receives a Perception check only if the disguised character is actively drawing attention, if the perceiving character is actively suspicious of everyone, or if the disguised character is attempting to impersonate a particular person that the perceiving character recognizes. Under one of these circumstances, a perceiving character can attempt one Perception check right away and then another check each hour.",
			"",
			"***A Single Disguise Check:*** Unlike most other skills, a character typically attempts a Disguise check only once when creating a physical disguise. Further Disguise checks might be necessary for things such as altering one's voice or using appropriate mannerisms or phrasing, but the basic disguise doesn't require further checks. The check result is supposed to be a secret that is revealed only the first time the disguise is truly tested, which can be tricky in the face of disguising characters who want their friends to tell them how good the disguise is. One way to handle this is to roll the Disguise check secretly only the first time it truly comes into opposition (see above), since the skill doesn't indicate when the check first occurs.",
			"",
			"***Disguise Is More Than Visual:*** Though the skill as presented in the Core Rulebook focuses on the visual aspects of disguise that a character prepares, later rules (such as the [vocal alteration](spell/vocal_alteration) spell) have made it clear that there are other aspects, including voice, mannerisms, and phrasing. The trick is to distinguish between the use of the Bluff and the Disguise skills. Generally, Bluff checks cover telling actual lies to support a disguise, whereas Disguise checks cover the other aspects, such as imitating mannerisms and speech.",
			"",
			"***Saw Through the Illusion:*** It is very tempting to use illusion or transmutation magic to augment a disguise, since the bonus is so high. As per the Core Rulebook, magic that penetrates an illusion or transmutation doesn't automatically see through a mundane disguise, but it negates the magical components of the costume. Thus, a true master of disguise uses both types of trickery, and she also ensures that the person who notices her use of magic has a way to explain the fact that disguise magic was involved at all. For instance, a rogue might disguise herself as a noble with mundane means and then use [disguise self](spell/disguise_self) to cloak herself in a glamer of that same noble, but more beautiful. Then, if someone sees through the illusion but not the mundane disguise, he would just think she was a vain noble instead of becoming suspicious due to the use of illusion magic and demanding a more thorough inspection.",
			"",
			"***Simulacrum and Disguise:*** The caster of the simulacrum spell uses the Disguise skill to shape the form created. However, it is important to note that the Sense Motive check to detect a simulacrum is very easy at the level that simulacrum becomes available, so unless the simulacrum has a high Bluff modifier, it is still challenging to use a simulacrum as an impostor for long."

			"The Intimidate skill allows characters to use fear to gain an advantage over others.",
			"",
			"***Scaring Them into Submission:*** Other than demoralizing foes in combat, the main use of the Intimidate skill is to force someone to capitulate to your requests by scaring them into doing so. This is similar to improving someone's attitude to friendly with Diplomacy and then making a request, but it doesn't require multiple rolls. Instead, the requests are restricted to those that provide limited assistance and actions that don't endanger the creature, including giving information. This means that an intimidated creature doesn't necessarily do what the intimidating character wants if it would be dangerous. After the Intimidate check, the target becomes unfriendly and might take actions such as reporting the intimidating character to the authorities. Thus, Diplomacy is often more likely to be successful in the long term in campaigns with interweaving plot lines and recurring characters. Since intimidation is based on fear, creatures immune to fear are also generally immune to attempts to use Intimidate against them.",
			"",
			"***Posturing and Bluster:*** The rules for the Intimidate skill specify that a check's DC is based on the target's HD and Wisdom modifier. That generally works when one person is attempting to Intimidate the other, but sometimes both parties are actively participating in acts of posturing and bluster. Since this DC is usually low, the two characters would end up intimidating each other, which isn't quite realistic. Instead, consider opposed Intimidate checks, or if the situation warrants it, a full-fledged [verbal duel](rule/verbal_duels).",
			"",
			"***Explaining Negative Consequences:*** Sometimes a character wants to calmly explain negative consequences to someone in a way that merely relies on logic, not fear. This is particularly important when attempting to convince someone immune to fear, such as a paladin or vampire, to back down in the face of negative consequences. This is different than improving a creature's attitude or making a request (particularly since a character might try it with an unfriendly creature), so it doesn't fall under Diplomacy. One good way to handle this is to use the rules for [influence](rule/influence) or verbal duels instead, since those both allow for logic and knowledge to help impact the situation. If only a skill check is possible, consider allowing an Intimidate check that doesn't apply any modifiers tied to frightening the target (such as the [Intimidating Prowess](feat/intimidating_prowess) feat, size modifiers, an [inquisitor's stern gaze](class/inquisitor), and so on) and then having the result not be a fear effect."

Certain stimuli automatically call for a Perception check, such as a creature using Stealth (which calls for an opposed Perception check), or the sounds of combat or talking in the distance. The flip side is when a player actively calls for a Perception check because her PC is intentionally searching for something. This always takes at least a move action, but often takes significantly longer. The Core Rulebook doesn't specify what area a PC can actively search, but for a given Perception check it should be no larger than a 10-foot-by-10-foot area, and often a smaller space if that area is cluttered. For instance, in an intrigue-based game, it is fairly common to look through a filing cabinet full of files. Though the cabinet itself might fill only a 5-foot-by-5-foot area, the number of files present could cause a search to take a particularly long time.",
			"",
			"***Precise and Imprecise Senses:*** Since Perception covers all senses, it is important to distinguish which of those senses count as observing a creature that is using Stealth. Some senses are more precise than others. Imprecise senses allow a creature to pinpoint the location of another creature, but they don't allow for the use of targeted effects, and attacks against those creatures are subject to miss chances from concealment. A few examples of imprecise senses are hearing, scent, blindsense, and tremorsense. A sense is precise if it allows the creature to use targeted effects on creatures and objects it senses, and to attack enemies without suffering a miss chance from concealment. This includes vision, touch, blindsight, and lifesense. Precise senses allow the creature to pinpoint an enemy's location. When a creature uses a precise sense to observe an enemy, that enemy is unable to use Stealth against the observer unless it creates a distraction first, or has a special ability allowing it to do so. Senses other than the listed ones count as precise or imprecise at the GM's discretion. A creature might have a limited form of a sense that makes it too weak to count as precise, such as a beast with primitive eyes that has difficulty seeing a creature that isn't moving.",
			"",
			"***Cover and Concealment for Stealth:*** The reason a character usually needs cover or concealment to use Stealth is tied to the fact that characters can't use Stealth while being observed. A sneaking character needs to avoid all of an opponent's precise senses in order to use Stealth, and for most creatures, that means vision. Effects such as [blur](spell/blur) and [displacement](spell/displacement), which leave a clear visual of the character within the perceiving character's vision, aren't sufficient to use Stealth, but a shadowy area or a curtain work nicely, for example. The hide in plain sight class ability allows a creature to use Stealth while being observed and thus avoids this whole situation. As the Core Rulebook mentions, a sneaking character can come out of cover or concealment during her turn, as long as she doesn't end her turn where other characters are directly observing her.",
			"",
			"***States of Awareness:*** In general, there are four states of awareness that a creature can have with regard to another creature using Stealth.",
			"",
			"***Unaware:*** On one end of the spectrum, a sneaking creature can succeed at Stealth well enough that the other creature isn't even aware that the creature is present. This state allows the sneaking creature to use abilities such as the [vigilante's startling appearance](class/vigilante). The Stealth skill description in the Core Rulebook says that perceiving creatures that fail to beat a sneaking character's Stealth check result are not aware of the sneaking character, but that is different from being totally unaware. This is also true of a creature that has previously been made aware of the creature's presence or location (see below) but is currently unable to observe the sneaking creature. In those cases, the sneaking creature can't use abilities such as startling presence.",
			"",
			"***Aware of Presence:*** The next state is when the perceiving creature is aware of the sneaking creature's presence, though not of anything beyond that. This is the state that happens when an invisible creature attacks someone and then successfully uses Stealth so the perceiving creature doesn't know where the attacker moved, or when a sniper succeeds at her Stealth check to snipe. A perceiving creature that becomes aware of a hidden creature's presence will still be aware of its presence at least until the danger of the situation continues, if not longer (though memory-altering magic can change this).",
			"",
			"***Aware of Location:*** The next state is awareness of location. This happens when a perceiving character uses an imprecise sense, such as hearing or tremorsense, to discover what square a hidden or invisible creature inhabits.",
			"",
			"***Observing:*** The final state is when the perceiving character is able to directly observe the sneaking character with a precise sense, such as vision. This is generally the result when the perceiving character rolls higher on its opposed Perception check than the sneaking character's Stealth result while also having line of sight to the sneaking character and the ability to see through any sort of invisibility or other tricks the sneaking character might be using."

			"The Sense Motive skill allows a character to analyze the way another character is acting and figure out if something is off. It also opposes Bluff to determine whether someone is lying, making it an important social defensive skill in an intrigue-based game.",
			"",
			"***Active and Automatic Sense Motive:*** Most uses of Sense Motive are active and require a character to spend a minute or more interacting with someone with the intent of using Sense Motive for a particular purpose. The only time that Sense Motive happens automatically is when it opposes [Bluff](skill/bluff), as a character attempts a Sense Motive check for every Bluff check attempted against him.",
			"",
			"***Noticing Enchantments:*** Sense Motive allows a character to notice someone whose behavior is being influenced by an enchantment, though as an active check, this takes at least 1 minute of interaction and the intention to sense enchantments. This doesn't notice enchantments that aren't actually causing a difference in behavior at the time. For instance, if a creature is under [charm person](spell/charm_person) but the caster isn't around and doesn't come up in conversation, a Sense Motive check won't reveal the enchantment.",
			"",
			"***Hunches:*** The use of Sense Motive to \"get a hunch\" mentions getting a feeling that someone is trustworthy or is an impostor, and it lists a static DC. This doesn't mean to say that anyone who can succeed at a DC 20 Sense Motive check can automatically find an impostor with high Bluff and Disguise modifiers. The DC 20 check assumes that the other character is not opposing the Sense Motive check with Bluff. This is particularly useful in situations with a group of impostors, one of whom is silver-tongued and does all the talking while the others aren't saying anything but aren't skilled at Bluff. For instance, a hunch might help against a group of quiet assassins dressed as servants and trickling into the grand hall. The information gained from a hunch is general, not specific, and usually results in an ambiguous inkling. You can get a vague feeling that something is wrong or that someone seems trustworthy, but no more specific information than that. In the example above, a character who received a hunch wouldn't know that the servants are specifically assassins, but would get a sense that something was off about the servants.",
			"",
			"***Sense Motive Is Not Mind Reading:*** Though Sense Motive can help ferret out lies and gain hunches about odd situations, it doesn't let a character read opponents' minds and know exactly what they're thinking or planning. It is a verification tool that works well in conjunction with other skills, rather than a skill that allows a character to ascertain information."

			"Especially in intrigue-based games, there are situations in which many different creatures might normally need to roll an opposed skill check against a PC. For instance, if the rogue sneaks into a camp of 50 orcs, it would technically require rolling 50 Perception checks. This slows down the game, and it makes it almost certain that one of those orcs will roll a natural 20. This variant rule replaces opposed rolls to reduce this sheer number of rolls and the likelihood for a skilled PC to be defeated by math alone.",
			"",
			"With this variant, when a character attempts a skill check that would normally be opposed, he attempts the check as normal, comparing the result against the DC presented by each foe (DC = 11 + the foe's total skill bonus with the opposed skill). If the initiating character fails this check, he simply fails and immediately experiences the consequences of failure. If he succeeds, however, he does so only against the rank-and-file opponents (such as most of the warriors in an orc camp, or most of the hangers-on at a royal court). Select foes (such as major NPCs or dedicated scouts and guards) can attempt a check with the opposing skill (DC = 11 + the initiating character's total skill bonus with skill he originally used). This resembles the way the Disguise skill works, where only those who pay attention to the character and are suspicious of her can attempt a Perception check.",
			"",
			"For example, if a hunter is sneaking through a camp of 50 orcs and succeeds at her initial Stealth check against a DC of 11 + each orc's Perception modifier, she slips into the camp. Meanwhile, the two orcs posted as sentries scan for trouble, so each of those orcs (but not the other 48) rolls a Perception check to see if they notice the hunter. Similarly, a bard might succeed at a Bluff check to convince the minor nobles of the court of his exaggerated exploits, but three key aristocrats-suspicious of the bard to begin with-try to poke holes in the story and find contradictions by grilling the bard for details, each of them rolling Sense Motive checks against a DC of 11 + the bard's Bluff modifier.",
			"",
			"***Multiple Bonuses:*** If the opposing group possesses a mix of bonuses, use the highest value to determine the DC. In the example of the orc camp, if 40 of the orc warriors have a -1 Perception modifier and 10 scouts have a +10 Perception modifier, the hunter would be attempting a DC 21 Stealth check. Note that because this variant doesn't specify which opponents beat the check, it is up to the GM to decide how the consequences of the failed check manifest.",
			"",
			"***The Odds:*** This variant increases the odds of success dramatically for highly skilled characters. For instance, if the hunter in the example above has a modifier on Stealth checks at least 9 higher than the orcs' Perception modifiers, in the default system, she would have a 50% chance of succeeding. But with this variant, her chance increases to 85%. When the character has less of an advantage against her adversaries, this variant still increases the rate of success dramatically with many adversaries, and it decreases the rate slightly with a few determined adversaries. For instance, with the default system, if the hunter's Stealth matched the orcs' Perception, she would have essentially a 0% chance of sneaking past the 50 orcs. With this variant, her chance is 1 in 8. However, if the other 48 orcs weren't present, her chance of sneaking past just the two sentries in the default system is roughly 1 in 4, whereas with this variant, it is 1 in 8, since only the determined adversaries make their own rolls and thus affect her odds."

Such uses are not guaranteed and should be considered carefully by the GM. Possibilities include casting a single spell that is one level higher than you could normally cast (or a 1st-level spell if you are not a spellcaster), making an attack that blinds a foe or bypasses its damage reduction entirely, or attempting to use Diplomacy to convince a raging dragon to give up its attack. Regardless of the desired action, the attempt should be accompanied by a difficult check or penalty on the attack roll. No additional hero points may be spent on such an attempt, either by the character or her allies.",
			"",
			"***Cheat Death:*** A character can spend 2 hero points to cheat death. How this plays out is up to the GM, but generally the character is left alive, with negative hit points but stable. For example, a character is about to be slain by a critical hit from an arrow. If the character spends 2 hero points, the GM decides that the arrow pierced the character's holy symbol, reducing the damage enough to prevent him from being killed, and that he made his stabilization roll at the end of his turn. Cheating death is the only way for a character to spend more than 1 hero point in a turn. The character can spend hero points in this way to prevent the death of a familiar, animal companion, eidolon, or special mount, but not another character or NPC."

			"The best known and most direct form of diabolical corruption, infernal contracts form a binding tie between a devil and a mortal. Such contracts take a variety of forms, typically parodying the laws and terminology of the mortal's society. An infernal contract takes the form of an offer, usually for extravagant goods or seemingly impossible services, presented by a devil to a mortal who has summoned it for exactly such a purpose. These contracts are exceptionally powerful and can alter lives-or even reality-in diverse ways for those who agree to sign such hellish documents. In return for fulfilling the terms of the contract, the devil receives the mortal's soul when the signer dies or at whatever time the contract specifies. While a mortal's soul is nearly always the target of such contracts, oftentimes devils occlude their desires, either within confusing legalese, sub-articles, and addenda, or by tailoring their fulfillment of the contract to provide the contractee with the means to damn himself. Thus, some infernal contracts are simple accounts of a blasphemous exchange, while others are rambling documents cloaking diabolical intentions. While more complex agreements are better at hiding a devil's desires, they might offer clever mortals opportunities to escape damnation.",
			"",
			"Infernal contracts are an expression of a timeless truth: mortals always desire more. Many mortals dream of worldly wealth and otherworldly power, but in the vast planar scheme, their existences are brief and their bargaining power limited. The devils of Hell offer a way around such limitations. Banking on mortals' ignorance of how the multiverse works and the true value of their intangible souls, devils offer mortals the fulfillment of this dream for what appears to be no price at all. To seal the bargain and prove their honesty, they create officious infernal contracts-elaborate written promises no less binding than the chains of Hell.",
			"",
			"Of Hell's contract makers, [phistophiluses](monster/phistophilus)-also called contract devils-are considered the finest authors of infernal bargains. The rulers of Hell-Asmodeus, the archdevils, the infernal dukes, and the malebranche-are also storied deal makers. But infernal contracts are not the purview of contract writers alone. The forces of Hell stand as a largely unified threat against mortal life, and most specimens among the legions of devilkind can requisition tools from a vast, treacherous arsenal. Thus, a mortal encounter with nearly any devil has the potential to end in an offer: What would you give for greatness?"

			"Before exploring the intricacies of the infernal contract, it should be noted that other fiends are often willing to enter into contracts with mortals as well. Lawful evil fiends are generally the most trustworthy in this regard. Neutral evil fiends usually honor a contract as long as they get something out of the bargain or feel like they come out ahead, while chaotic evil fiends will almost always look to cheat or blatantly disregard the wording of a contract. All contracts with non-devil fiends carry with them a markedly increased level of risk to the mortal, and in many cases, the only possible outcome of such a foolish endeavor is the forfeiture of the mortal's soul-yet there are always extenuating circumstances that make the forging of such a risky contract a viable (or perhaps the only) option. For example, a king might agree to sign a contract with a powerful demon, knowing full well that the demon will break the contract, yet if signing the contract can buy even a few extra hours for a group of adventurers to attempt a desperate gambit to save the kingdom, such a sacrifice may be worth it in the end. How a non-devil fiend honors a contract is generally left up to the GM, but the basic mechanics work as for infernal contracts."

			"An infernal contract is a baffling linguistic labyrinth, rife with eons-old legalese, otherworldly citations, and near-endless clauses and counterclauses. One might consist of single scroll covered in fine handwriting, while another might consist of volumes of printed text bound in sable.",
			"",
			"Skimming an infernal contract and getting the gist of it takes only a matter of moments. Reading one in its entirety, though, can take hours, if not days, and is similar in many ways to performing [research in a library](rule/research). All infernal contracts have a number of knowledge points (abbreviated as \"kp\") representing the sum of the contract's information. To research an infernal contract, a character must succeed at a Linguistics check or a specialized skill check as indicated by the contract in question. The DC of this Research check varies, but if the researcher uses the more specialized check to perform this research, she gains a +2 circumstance bonus for using precisely the correct skill for interpreting the contract, as opposed to the more general use of Linguistics. Attempting a Research check requires an uninterrupted 8-hour period of research, and characters cannot take 10 or 20 on this check. Each additional 8-hour period of research on the same contract grants a cumulative +1 bonus on Research checks. Up to two characters can use the aid another action to assist a researcher.",
			"",
			"Succeeding at a Research check reduces the contract's knowledge points, similar to dealing damage to a creature's hit points. As the knowledge points decrease, the contract reveals its secrets. The amount of kp reduced on a successful Research check depends on the intellectual capacities of the contract's primary researcher. A character with the ability to attempt any Knowledge check untrained (such as a [bard](class/bard), [loremaster](prestigeclass/loremaster), or [skald](class/skald)) reduces a contract's kp by 1d12 + the character's Intelligence modifier. Other scholarly characters ([alchemists](class/alchemist), [arcanists](class/arcanist), [investigators](class/investigator), [wizards](class/wizard), and so on, at the GM's discretion) reduce the contract's knowledge points by 1d8 + the character's Intelligence modifier. All other characters reduce the contract's knowledge points by 1d4 + the character's Intelligence modifier. Rolling a natural 20 on a Research check acts like a critical threat. If the researcher confirms the critical hit by immediately succeeding at a second Research check with all the same modifiers, the resulting knowledge point reduction is doubled. Rolling a natural 1 on a Research check results in an automatic failure, and the contract's knowledge points increase by 1d8. Because of the purposefully obtuse nature of infernal contracts, some researchers reach a dead end in their understanding of the document and are unable to further decrease a contract's knowledge points. Failing two consecutive Research checks means the researcher has misunderstood the contract's terms. In this case, the contract's knowledge points return to maximum and the researcher can't attempt to research that particular contract again until he gains a level.",
			"",
			"Infernal contracts contain only the overt terms of the agreement and, potentially, oblique provisos. Unless a GM stipulates otherwise, no knowledge other than that specified is gained through researching a contract. Not every infernal contract has hidden language-some are completely forthright. Those that do conceal cunningly disguised traps, though, can have their secrets revealed by reducing the contract's kp to its hidden condition threshold. Note that it is possible for a contract to have multiple hidden condition thresholds, though the ones detailed in this book have only one each. If such an unfavorable term is called out to a devil, it will usually acquiesce to changing the contract, though doing so means creating the contract all over again, and the new contract is by no means assured to be free of insidious new stipulations.",
			"",
			"Once a contract's kp is reduced to 0, the researcher discovers a flaw that could allow for an early termination of the contract. A mortal might exploit such a loophole to end the contract. In doing so, she would lose the contract's benefit but regain her soul. The specifics of this loophole might not be simple to engineer, but they provide hope of an escape.

The mortal is free to do whatever he pleases with his copy, though destroying it is rarely directly helpful. Devils tend to do one of two things with their copies: Some keep the documents close at hand, securing them in vaults or in the care of guardians of their choosing. Most, however, send their contracts back to Hell for safekeeping, typically to the Fallen Fastness in Dis. In this infernal library, contracts are protected by countless diabolical scholars, the sanity shattering complexity of the library's organization, and its planar inaccessibility. For most mortals, retrieving a contract from Hell is practically impossible. Yet even once an infernal contract is signed and secured, there are still routes by which it might be changed-or escaped.",

			"***Transferring a Contract:*** A devil might be convinced to adjust the terms of an infernal contract to apply to a different mortal. Just as in the case of the original signee, the new mortal must enter into the contract freely, accepting the benefits but also the damnation. Occasionally, a damned mortal can convince a second mortal to take his place in an infernal deal, or a particularly self-sacrificing mortal might decide to take on a loved one's contract. In either case, the devil must deem the new signee an equal or more valuable soul. Only the devil that created the original document (or had it created) can adjust the terms of an infernal contract, which must be done in the presence of the former signee, the new signee, and one copy of the original contract. Once the new signee commits her signature to the contract, with the devil as witness, the former signee's name is erased and both copies of the contract immediately change. The effects of the adjusted contract are left to the parties involved, but most commonly, the former signee loses all benefits and conditions of the contract, while the new signee gains them.",
			"",
			"***Destroying a Contract:*** If both copies of an infernal contract are destroyed, the contract ends. The mortal and devil lose all benefits of the contract, and the mortal's soul is released to follow whatever natural course it might take upon death. This requires obtaining both copies of the contract, which isn't easy; a devil guards its contracts and isn't likely to let a mortal go back on a contract without a fight. Recovering the devil's copy of a contract might require the mortal to plunge into the depths of Hell itself.",
			"",
			"If the mortal signee has already died and her soul is already in Hell, destroying the contract does not transport the soul to the afterlife where it otherwise would have been sent. The best the petitioner can hope for is to be liberated from her tortures, and her escape is made even more challenging by the fact that her soul is now free game for all of Hell's various deadly denizens. Moreover, the weight of having made a deal with a devil stays with a soul for the rest of its existence. Even after escaping a contract (or Hell itself, in the previous case), a mortal might still be forsaken by her deity and find herself condemned to Hell or any of the other evil-aligned planes. Actual salvation might require much more than the mere destruction of the infernal contract."

Most of the decisions are in the hands of the players, and these rules are written with that assumption, using terms like \"your kingdom\" and \"your army.\" However, the GM is still in charge of the campaign, and is expected to make judgments about the repercussions of player decisions. While players running a kingdom should be allowed to read these rules (having them do so makes much of the kingdom building easier for the GM), the players shouldn't think they can abuse these rules to exploit weird corner cases. For example, players may decide to construct a city full of graveyards because of the bonuses they provide to the city, but if the GM believes that is unreasonable, he could decide that the city is prone to frequent undead attacks. Likewise, a settlement with more magic shops than houses and businesses may slowly become a ghost town as all the normal citizens move elsewhere out of superstitious fear. As with a normal campaign, the GM is the final arbiter of the rules, and can make adjustments to events as necessary for the campaign."

However, characters who are keen to spread their wings and forge a place of power and influence in the world can use this chapter to create a different sort of campaign.

(Individual citizens and even some leaders may be of different alignments.)",

			"",
			"A kingdom's alignment rarely changes, though at the GM's option, it can shift through the actions of its rulers or its people.",
			"",
			"***Build Points:*** Build points (or BP for short) are the measure of your kingdom's resources-equipment, labor, money, and so on. They're used to acquire new hexes and develop additional buildings, settlements, and terrain improvements. Your kingdom also consumes BP to maintain itself.",
			"",
			"***Consumption:*** Consumption indicates how many BP are required to keep the kingdom functioning each month. Your kingdom's Consumption is equal to its Size, modified by settlements and terrain improvements (such as Farms and Fisheries). Consumption can never go below 0.",
			"",
			"***Control DC:*** Some kingdom actions require a check (1d20 + modifiers) to succeed-this is known as a control check. The base DC for a control check is equal to 20 + the kingdom's Size in hexes + the total number of districts in all your settlements + any other modifiers from special circumstances or effects. Unless otherwise stated, the DC of a kingdom check is the Control DC.",
			"",
			"***Economy:*** This attribute measures the productivity of your kingdom's workers and the vibrancy of its trade, both in terms of money and in terms of information, innovation, and technology. Your kingdom's initial Economy is 0 plus your kingdom's alignment and leadership modifiers.",
			"",
			"***Kingdom Check:*** A kingdom has three attributes: Economy, Loyalty, and Stability. Your kingdom's initial scores in each of these attributes is 0, plus modifiers for kingdom alignment, bonuses provided by the leaders, and any other modifiers.",
			"",
			"Many kingdom actions and events require you to attempt a kingdom check, either using your Economy, Loyalty, or Stability attribute (1d20 + the appropriate attribute + other modifiers). You cannot take 10 or take 20 on a kingdom check. Kingdom checks automatically fail on a natural 1 and automatically succeed on a natural 20.",
			"",
			"***Loyalty:*** Loyalty refers to the sense of goodwill among your people, their ability to live peaceably together even in times of crisis, and to fight for one another when needed. Your kingdom's initial Loyalty is 0 plus your kingdom's alignment and any modifiers from your kingdom's leadership role.",
			"",
			"***Population:*** Actual population numbers don't factor into your kingdom's statistics, but can be fun to track anyway. The population of each settlement is described in [Settlements and Districts](rule/settlements_and_districts).",
			"",
			"***Size:*** This is how many hexes the kingdom claims. A new kingdom's Size is 1.",
			"",
			"***Stability:*** Stability refers to the physical and social well-being of the kingdom, from the health and security of its citizenry to the vitality of its natural resources and its ability to maximize their use. Your kingdom's initial Stability is 0 plus your kingdom's alignment and leadership modifiers.",
			"",
			"***Treasury:*** The Treasury is the amount of BP your kingdom has saved and can spend on activities (much in the same way that your character has gold and other valuables you can spend on gear). Your Treasury can fall below 0 (meaning your kingdom's costs exceed its savings and it is operating in debt), but this increases Unrest (see [Kingdom Upkeep Phase](rule/kingdom_upkeep_phase)).",
			"",
			"***Turn:*** A kingdom turn spans 1 month of game time. You make your kingdom checks and other decisions about running your kingdom at the end of each month.",
			"",
			"***Unrest:*** Your kingdom's Unrest indicates how rebellious your citizens are. Your kingdom's initial Unrest is 0. Unrest can never fall below 0 (anything that would modify it to less than 0 is wasted). Subtract your kingdom's Unrest from all Economy, Loyalty, and Stability checks.",
			"",
			"If your kingdom's Unrest is 11 or higher, the kingdom begins to lose control of hexes it has claimed.",

Time spent ruling cannot be used for adventuring, crafting magic items, or completing other [downtime activities](rule/downtime_activities) that require your full attention and participation.

Abdicating a position increases Unrest by 1 and requires a Loyalty check; if the check fails, the vacancy penalty applies for 1 turn while the new leader transitions into that role.

Some roles have no vacancy penalty. If a character in a role is killed or permanently incapacitated during a turn and not restored to health by the start of the next kingdom turn, that role counts as vacant for that next turn, after which a replacement can be appointed to the role.",

As the leaders, you use your power and influence to direct the economic and constructive activity of your kingdom, deciding what gets built, when, and where.",

In general, 1 BP is worth approximately 4,000 gp; use this value to get a sense of how costly various kingdom expenditures are. In practice, it is not a simple matter to convert one currency to the other, but there are certain ways for your PC to spend gp to increase the kingdom's BP or withdraw BP and turn them into gold for your character to spend.",

			"Before you can start your own kingdom, you first need a base of operations-a fort, village, or other settlement-where you can rest between adventures and where your citizens know they can find you if they need help or want to pay their taxes. Once you have a kingdom, you'll want to create more settlements in order for the kingdom to grow and prosper. To found a settlement, you must perform the following steps. (These steps assume you're building a new settlement from scratch; if you're attempting to incorporate an existing settlement into your kingdom, see Free City under [Special Terrain](rule/special_terrain).)",
			"",
			"Step 1-Acquire funds. You'll need money and resources in the form of build points.",
			"",
			"Step 2-Explore and clear a hex. You'll need to explore the hex where you want to put the settlement. See the Exploration Time column on [Table 4-6: Terrain and Terrain Improvements](rule/terrain_improvements) to see how long this takes. Once you have explored the hex, clear it of monsters and dangerous hazards. The time needed to clear it depends on the nature of the threats; this step is usually handled by you completing adventures there to kill or drive out monsters.",
			"",
			"Step 3-Claim the hex as yours. Once you have BP and have explored and cleared the hex, you can claim it. Spend 1 BP to do so; this represents setting up very basic infrastructure such as clearing paths, hiring patrols, setting up a tent city, and so on. This establishes the hex as part of your kingdom (or the beginning of your kingdom).",
			"",
			"Step 4-Prepare the site for construction. To put a settlement on a claimed hex, you'll need to prepare it. Depending on the site, this process may involve clearing trees, moving boulders, digging sanitation trenches, and so on. See the Preparation Cost column on [Table 4-6: Terrain and Terrain Improvements](rule/terrain_improvements) for the BP cost.",
			"",
			"If your settlement is in a hex containing a canal, lake, ocean, river, or similar large body of water, you must decide which of your settlement's borders are water (riverbanks, lakeshores, or seashores) or land. Some types of buildings, such as Mills, Piers, and Waterfronts, must be adjacent to water.",
			"",
			"A new settlement consists of 1 district, represented by the District Grid map [found in the physical book on pg. 226]. Mark the four borders on the District Grid as land or water, as appropriate.",
			"",
			"Step 5-Construct your first buildings. Construct 1 building in your settlement and pay its BP cost. See [Building Descriptions](rule/building_descriptions) for building types. If this is your kingdom's first settlement, you should start with an Inn, Shrine, Monastery, or Watchtower. In addition, you may also purchase and construct 1 House, Mansion, Noble Villa, or Tenement. If your first building is an Inn, you must construct a House or Tenement next to it, as building an Inn requires an adjacent House or Tenement.",
			"",
			"When you complete these steps, you've founded your settlement! If this is your first settlement, it's considered your kingdom's [capital city](rule/capital_city)."

			"In addition to the commonly available items in a settlement as determined by its [base value](rule/the_settlement_stat_block), some buildings increase the likelihood of having specific or unusual magic items available for purchase.",
			"",
			"***Gaining Item Slots:*** When you construct one of these buildings, mark the appropriate boxes in the Magic Items section of the settlement's District Grid; this indicates that the settlement has gained a slot for an item of that type.",
			"",
			"***Filling Item Slots:*** In Step 3 of the Upkeep phase, you roll to fill vacant magic item slots in each district. Roll d% once for each district that has an open magic item slot (if the district has more than one, select one randomly). There is a 50% chance (51-100) that an appropriate magic item becomes available in that slot. This item's price cannot exceed the base value for the settlement (reroll if the item's price exceeds the settlement's base value).",
			"",
			"Example: Jessica's settlement has a base value of 200 gp. She built an Herbalist last turn, giving the settlement 1 minor potion slot. In the Upkeep phase this turn, she rolls d% and gets a result of 62, meaning she can roll a random minor potion to fill the settlement's empty slot. She rolls on [Table 15-12: Potions](rule/potions) and gets a result of 45, indicating a potion of a 1st-level spell. If she had rolled anything more valuable than the 200 gp base value for her settlement, she would have to reroll until she got an acceptable result. Once a magic item is rolled for a settlement in this way, it remains on the market until someone purchases it.",
			"",
			"***Emptying Item Slots:*** If you are unsatisfied with a magic item generated by a settlement, there are three ways to purge an undesirable item and make its slot vacant. The first is to purchase it with your own gp, which makes it your personal property and means you may do with it what you please (use it, sell it at half price for gold, deposit it in the kingdom's Treasury during the next Income phase, use it as a reward for a local general, and so on).",
			"",
			"The second method is to manipulate your kingdom's economy to encourage an NPC to purchase the item (such as a random adventurer passing through the settlement). During Step 3 of the Income phase, you may attempt one Economy check for each filled slot you want to empty. For every such check after the first one in a turn, your Economy decreases by 1, since these manipulations are harmful to your kingdom's economy and typically only serve to get rid of an item you consider undesirable. If the check fails, nothing happens. If the check succeeds, erase the item from that slot; you may attempt to fill the empty slot as normal in the next Upkeep phase. You do not gain any gp or BP from this sale; the money goes to the building's owner, who uses it to acquire or craft the next item.",
			"",
			"The third way is to spend BP (1 BP = 2,000 gp) to purchase the item. If you take the item for your own use, this counts as withdrawing BP from the Treasury for your personal use (see [Make Withdrawals from the Treasury](rule/kingdom_income_phase)). If you use the item in a way that doesn't directly benefit you or the other PCs (such as giving it to a hero of your army or donating it to a settlement as a religious or historical artifact), then purchasing it is essentially like other kingdom expenditures and does not increase Unrest or decrease Loyalty."

In effect, your kingdom automatically controls a small portion of the waters adjacent to its coastline. Because any new hex you claim must be adjacent to an existing hex in your kingdom, if you want to claim land beyond that water (such as an island), you must first explore and claim the intervening deep water hexes. Your exploration only applies to the water's surface-you are searching for uncharted islands, dangerous reefs, and so on. The GM may want to treat the underwater portion of a hex as a separate hex, much like a network of large caves under a hex may count as its own hex, allowing a village of merfolk or sahuagin to thrive in your kingdom without your knowledge."

If you build smaller buildings on top of a site that held a multi-lot building, split the discount evenly over the new buildings. For example, if you demolish an Academy and construct a Mansion and a Luxury Store on top of those lots, each building gets a 6 BP discount (1/4 of 52 BP is 13, divided evenly between the two)."

If 2 buildings give the same discount, only one discount applies per new building, but you may construct 2 buildings at the discounted cost.

For example, a Shop or Tavern must be adjacent to a House or Mansion. The required adjacent building can only count toward 1 building that requires it.

This should not occur, however, if you build too many Houses, Parks, Tenements, or Waterways.",

To upgrade a building, pay the BP cost difference between the current building and the new building. Remove the modifiers from the old building and apply the modifiers from the new building. Upgrading counts as constructing a building for the purpose of the maximum number of buildings you can construct on your turn.

			"***Offense Modifier (OM):*** This is a modifier added to a d20 roll to determine the army's chance of success, much like an individual creature's attack bonus. The army's OM is equal to its ACR.

			"",
			"***Morale:*** This number represents how confident the army is.

If there is an extended break (such as stopping at nightfall to resume combat in the morning) or the battle conditions change significantly (such as the assassination of a commander, the arrival of another army, and so on), the GM should treat each period of combat between armies as one battle.

This phase typically lasts for 1 round (one attack) as the two armies use ranged attacks while they advance to melee range, and then use melee attacks thereafter. The battlefield's shape and other conditions can extend this duration. If both armies have ranged attacks, they may choose to stay at range and never approach each other for melee (at least until they run out of ammunition, though the Consumption cost of maintaining an army generally means the army is capable of many shots before this happens). Armies without ranged capability can't attack during this phase, but may still rush forward.",

			"| Animal Companion (Druid 1, Ranger 4) | The army's animal companions increase the army's OM by 1. |",

			"| Invisibility | Any army attacking this army takes a -2 penalty to its OM for that attack. Any army attacked by this army takes a -2 penalty to its DV against its attacks. Armies that can't see invisible creatures can't prevent this army from withdrawing. |",
			"| Judgment (Inquisitor 1) | Once each Ranged or Melee phase, the army may choose to increase its damage by 1, increase its DV by 1, heal a number of hit points equal to half its ACR, or treat its attacks as magic weapons.

			"| Mindless | The army never fails Morale checks, but must always use standard tactics and strategy. |",
			"| Mobility | If the units have a form of mobility that gives them an advantage in the battlefield's terrain (such as boggards in a swamp), increase the army's OM by 1 for that battle against armies without such mobility. |",
			"| Mount (Cavalier 1) | The army's mounts increase the army's OM and DV by 1. |",
			"| Order (Cavalier 1) | When using the challenge ability, increase the army's DV by 1 against the challenged army. |",
			"| Paralysis | Each time the army damages an enemy army, reduce the enemy army's DV by 1. |",
			"| Petrification | This ability functions as paralysis. |",
			"| Plant | The army is immune to fear, paralysis, and poison. |",
			"| Poison Resistance (Alchemist 2) | If the army takes poison damage, reduce the damage by half of the unit's poison resistance bonus. |",
			"| Poison | This ability functions as bleed. |",
			"| Pounce | The army increases its OM by 1. |",
			"| Powerful Charge | The army increases its OM by 1. |",
			"| Rage (Barbarian 1) | Once per battle, the commander may order the army to rage. Increase the army's OM by 2, decrease its DV by 1, and add a +1 bonus on its Morale checks against fear and routing. While this is in effect, the army can't use the tactics cautious combat, defensive wall, expert flankers, hold the line, sniper support, or withdraw; nor can it use the defensive or cautious strategies. If using such a tactic or strategy, you immediately switch to the standard tactic or strategy. |",
			"| Rake | The army increases the damage it deals by 1. |",
			"| Regeneration | The army regains a number of hit points equal to half its regeneration value each Ranged or Melee phase. When an army with regeneration is reduced to 0 hp, it is defeated only if at least one enemy army survives at the end of that phase to finish off the regenerating creatures. Outside of battle, the army regains a number of hit points equal to half its regeneration value each hour. |",
			"| Rend | The army increases the damage it deals by 1. |",
			"| Resistance | See the entry for significant defense. |",
			"| Rock Catching | The army increases its DV by 1 against ranged attacks. This increases by an additional 1 if the army is attacked with siege weapons or thrown rocks. |",
			"| Rock Throwing | The army can make ranged attacks. In the Ranged phase, it deals +4 points of damage. |",
			"| Rogue Talent (Rogue 2) | The army gains the bleed ability. |",
			"| Scent | The army reduces its OM and DV penalties from darkness, invisibility, and weather by half. |",
			"| Shield Ally (Summoner 4) | Increase the army's DV by 1. |",
			"| Significant Defense | The army has a significant defense such as powerful damage reduction or numerous immunities and/or resistances. Increase its DV by 10, but only against armies that can't overcome those defenses. In some cases, the GM might rule that an army is simply undefeatable by an enemy army because of its defenses (though the GM should never pit the PCs against such an army unless the PCs initiate a foolish battle). |",
			"| Smite Evil (Paladin 1) | In one Melee phase per battle, the army may increase its OM by 2 against an evil army. If the target army is undead or evil outsiders, the OM increases by 4 instead. |",
			"| Sneak Attack (Rogue 1) | The army increases its OM by 1 when making an ambush, when using the expert flankers tactic, or on the phase after using the false retreat tactic. |",
			"| Spell Resistance | The army increases its DV by 6 against armies with the spellcasting ability. |",
			"| Spellcasting | If an army's units can use magic (from either spell-like abilities or actual spellcasting), increase its OM and DV by the spell level of the highest-level spell the individual unit can cast. If any of the army's offensive spells has a range greater than touch, the army can make ranged attacks. |",
			"| Stunning Fist (Monk 1) | This ability functions as paralysis. |",
			"| Swarm | The army takes half damage from nonmagical attacks, but 1-1/2 times as much damage from magical attacks. It ignores DV bonuses from armor resources. It can't harm an army with the incorporeal or significant defense ability. It automatically succeeds at checks to withdraw. |",
			"| Tactician (Cavalier 1) | The army automatically learns one tactic (usually the cavalry experts tactic); this doesn't count toward an army's maximum number of known tactics. |",
			"| Teleportation | The army ignores the Defense of fortifications. It automatically succeeds at checks to withdraw. Ethereal travel and similar effects also grant this ability. An army with teleportation can travel to any hex on the same day (its speed is irrelevant and not hampered by difficult terrain). |",
			"| Track (Inquisitor 2, Ranger 1) | The army adds its ACR to Morale checks to prevent an army from using the withdraw tactic and to its DV to prevent ambushes. It reduces the damage it deals in fog by one quarter instead of one half. |",
			"| Trample | The army increases its OM by 1. |",
			"| Trap Sense (Rogue 3) | When using the siegebreaker tactic, the army adds half its ACR to the Offense check to determine if a siege engine is destroyed. |",
			"| Tremorsense | The army reduces its OM and DV penalties from darkness, invisibility, and weather by half. |",
			"| Trip | Each Melee phase, the target enemy army reduces its DV by 1 until the end of the phase. |",
			"| Undead | The army is immune to disease, fear, paralysis, and poison. Its DV increases by 2. |",
			"| Unnatural Aura | This ability functions as fear, but applies only to animals (including animal mounts). |",
			"| Vortex | This ability functions as paralysis, but only against targets on or in the water. |",
			"| Weapon Specialization (Fighter 4) | Once per battle, increase the army's OM for either ranged or melee attacks by 2. |",
			"| Whirlwind | This ability functions as paralysis. |",
			"| Wild Shape (Druid 4) | Once per battle, the army may gain the aquatic, amphibious, climb, darkvision, flight, low-light vision, or scent special abilities, but loses the spellcasting ability while this is in effect. The army can end this ability in any later phase. |"

For an army with a very low hit point total, the number of active units in the army can even be equal to or fewer than those of an army of a smaller size. For example, a Large army normally has 200 units, but if that army is very wounded, it could have only 100 or fewer units able to fight-the same number as a Medium army.

If the army lists an additional cost for recruiting the army, this recruitment cost scales in the same way.",

For example, an individual troglodyte's stench nauseates opponents, but there is no army special ability that does that, so the troglodyte army has paralysis instead, which has a comparable effect. Likewise, the astral deva army has the alchemy ability, which is a reasonable approximation of an individual astral deva's ability to use [heal](spell/heal) once per day; the one-unit army doesn't actually carry alchemist extracts.",
			"",
			"If a special ability provides a constant bonus (such as the bonus from charge or pounce), that bonus is automatically included in the army's stat block. If the bonus is conditional (like the DV bonus from rock catching or the ranged damage bonus from rock throwing), you need to account for that bonus when the conditions are right.",
			"",

This represents the unit's special defenses (such as damage reduction) and high damage output against single targets, which should affect an opposing army in a greater way than the standard monster-to-army conversion rules would indicate. Determining army stat block values for small numbers of powerful monsters is more of an art than a science."

And of the young elf who spends years studying musty tomes and practicing simple spells before she heads out into the world to seek ancient lore. These are the stories of everyday adventurers, risen from the ranks of the common folk to make a name for themselves in places harsh and unforgiving.",
			"",
			"But these are not the only stories of heroism. Some adventurers are beyond exemplary-their stories forge the greatest sagas of history, and their every deed births a legend. From the children of gods, blessed with the divine spark, to the lucky heroes born under auspicious stars, these characters are destined to greatness. They are mythic: possessed of unparalleled heroism and capable of astounding acts.",
			"",
			"To be mythic means to draw upon a power that few even dare to understand, and even fewer hope to wield. An air of destiny surrounds mythic characters, and each choice they make shapes the world at large. Their story is intertwined with the great events of the day, and their actions are central to the outcomes. Mythic characters are more resilient and powerful than others, and as a result are awe-inspiring in ways their non-mythic counterparts could never match. Other adventurers might balk at taking on a dragon that plagues a village, but mythic heroes would not only take on the dragon, but also clear the entire region of threats.",
			"",
			"Ultimately, the story of mythic heroes is defined by the challenges they face. The GM has a number of new and awe-inspiring tools with which to confront mythic player characters, ranging from immense and deadly mythic monsters to vile and cunning mythic villains. Mythic monsters are unique creatures or remnants of a bygone age when such terrifying beasts ruled over the land. They now dwell in the lost places of the world, waiting for their time to bring great terror. Mythic villains have many of the powers of mythic characters, but they use their abilities selfishly-to subjugate kingdoms, slaughter the innocent, and bring ruin to the world. Unless heroes rise to stop them, mythic villains can cause destruction and chaos on an unimaginable scale.",
			"",
			"Even with such great power, mythic characters are not invulnerable, just more able to deal with the dangers of the world around them. If a mythic character dies, her loss is a great tragedy to the world, as the light of one of its true champions has been extinguished. This is what makes a mythic story exciting: these heroes might fall, just as non-mythic heroes might succumb to lesser threats. And when they do succeed, their victory often comes at a high cost, and usually leaves them scarred.",
			"",
			"The rules in this book give players and GMs the tools they need to run mythic adventures. The mythic rules add to the base rules of the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game, either as part of an adventure in which the PCs attain mythic power for a limited time, or as the backbone of an entire campaign charting the legend of a group of mythic characters."

			"In a world of might and sorcery, with dragons and elves, what does it mean to be \"mythic\"? Being mythic means possessing a degree of might unusual even in a fantasy world. Scenes turn more dramatic, the enemies are more lethal, and the consequences of the heroes' actions make a far-ranging impact. Being mythic means invoking a sense of wonder and awe even in those already accustomed to the strange and unusual.",
			"",
			"The way this book portrays the mythic narrative isn't solely about stories at 20th level and monsters with high Challenge Ratings-it's about the surprising and unfamiliar regardless of power and scale. Even 1st-level characters could be imbued with mythic power and become forces to be reckoned with. Similarly, lesser monsters such as ogres and skeletons that become mythic transform into terrifying foes with unknown powers, changing the nature of the story you're playing-and startling those accustomed to their non-mythic ilk.",
			"",
			"Not only the characters take on unexpected forms in mythic adventures; the setting does as well. The vistas are more dramatic, featuring flying islands and keeps that float in raging volcanoes. The colors are brighter, the sounds are more mysterious, and all of the other stimuli are sharper and more vibrant. Where the non-mythic hero would encounter a crumbling keep filled with familiar monsters, a mythic hero faces a towering citadel that builds itself from the bones of would-be invaders and is inhabited by cruel and malign creatures of nearly god-like power.",
			"",
			"Besides the setting, the challenges that face mythic characters are far more harrowing than usual. Enhanced abilities allow mythic characters to take on threats beyond the reach of those without such power. They can face with ease foes both powerful and numerous. The real challenge is when they take on mythic creatures that possess the same resilient nature and abilities similar in potency to those they themselves rely on. When a mythic hero comes face to face with a mythic monster, the battle is truly legendary.",
			"",
			"Finally, mythic adventures feature difficult choices and far-reaching consequences. As the characters progress through the story, they're tasked with taking on challenges that seem impossible even to them, and might be tempted to wander from their path. As mythic heroes, they're the first to respond to cataclysmic events, just as they're the last bastion to stem the tide of evil and darkness that threatens to wash over the world. Their successes and failures leave marks on the world for centuries to come."

			"Mythic Adventures uses several terms that are new to the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game, or that previously existed but were rarely used. These terms are worth reviewing before continuing on with the rest of this book.",
			"",
			"***Ascension:*** The [moment of ascension](rule/mythic_ascension) is the moment when a normal character becomes a mythic character. This event is usually a critical moment in the story that helps to define the mythic character's origin and the source of her power. Once a character has undergone ascension, she gains her first mythic tier and can select a mythic path.",
			"",
			"***Boon:*** When a mythic character completes a particularly difficult task, the GM might reward that character with a [boon](rule/mythic_boons). A boon represents having earned the favor of the source of the character's power. Once acquired, a boon allows the character to draw upon mythic power one additional time that day. A mythic character might be rewarded with a boon several times in a single session, but no more than once per encounter.",
			"",
			"***DR/Epic:*** A type of damage reduction, DR/epic can be overcome only by a weapon with an enhancement bonus of +6 or greater. Weapons with special abilities also count as epic for the purposes of overcoming damage reduction if the total bonus value of all of their abilities (including the enhancement bonus) is +6 or greater.",
			"",
			"***Mythic:*** With abilities seemingly beyond the those of ordinary mortals, a mythic character or mythic monster becomes part of a story that plays out on a greater scale than ordinary people can understand. An attack, spell, or other effect is considered mythic if it originates from a mythic source, such as a character or creature with a mythic tier or rank. (See [Mythic versus Non-Mythic](rule/mythic_versus_non-mythic).)",
			"",
			"***Mythic Path:*** (Often referred to just as a \"path.\") The theme of a character's mythic abilities is determined by her [mythic path](rule/mythic_paths)-archmage, champion, guardian, hierophant, marshal, or trickster. Each path has a number of special abilities associated with it that the character can select as she advances in tier.",
			"",
			"***Mythic Power:*** Each mythic character can call upon this [base mythic ability](rule/base_mythic_abilities) to influence destiny and fuel other abilities. At its most basic, mythic power is needed to use the surge ability, but it can also be called upon to use a number of other mythic abilities.",
			"",
			"***Mythic Rank:*** (Often referred to just as a \"rank.\") Similar to tiers, [mythic ranks](rule/mythic_rank) are used to describe the approximate mythic power possessed by a monster. All creatures with a mythic rank are considered mythic for the purposes of feats, spells, magic items, and other abilities. Mythic ranks range from 1 to 10.",
			"",
			"***Mythic Tier:*** (Often referred to just as a \"tier.\") Mythic characters advance in power by [gaining tiers](rule/gaining_tiers), each of which grants new abilities. Attaining a new mythic tier requires completing difficult trials within the campaign's story rather than accumulating experience points. Mythic tiers range from 1 to 10. Characters who achieve 10th tier are at the height of mythic power, and are in some respects akin to minor deities.",
			"",
			"***Mythic Trial:*** (Often referred to just as a \"trial.\") A [trial](rule/gaining_tiers) is a difficult task that awaits mythic heroes. It usually represents the culmination of part of the heroes' story, marking it as an important point in their legend. A mythic character has to complete one or more trials in order to reach a new mythic tier. Trials and mythic path advancement are separate from XP and character level advancement, and are based on grand achievements within the story rather than individual encounters.",
			"",
			"***Non-Mythic:*** Any attack, spell, or effect originating from a character or creature without any mythic abilities is non-mythic. This term can also refer to a character without a mythic tier or a creature without a mythic rank.(See [Mythic versus Non-Mythic](rule/mythic_versus_non-mythic).)",
			"",
			"***Surge:*** Surge is a basic ability that each mythic character receives. It allows her to roll a die and add the result to a d20 roll, influencing the outcome after the results are revealed."

Whichever path is chosen influences how you create your mythic character.",

			"",
			"If mythic power will instead be a central theme of the entire campaign, each PC might have a different, individual source of power. In such a campaign, you should work with your GM to determine the source of your mythic power. This could be anything from contact with an ancient artifact to gaining the sponsorship of a deity. The GM might ask for all of the PCs to share some aspects of their power-such as its source-to give them a common bond, or you might come together as part of a larger destiny, a gathering of great heroes to accomplish truly legendary deeds.",

This critical part of the story is called the ***moment of ascension***. Depending on the style of the campaign, this could occur very early in the story or much later in your character's career, as part of larger plotline.
