			"While raiding, these barbarians employ the element of surprise; in the faint predawn light, they quietly row their longship with muffled oars as they draw near the targeted settlement. Sometimes Ulfen raiders might put in at a nearby, uninhabited harbor so as to approach their quarry on foot from inland, using nearby terrain as cover. However they approach, the raiders aim to catch their prize unawares to prevent their prey from fleeing with valuable plunder. When a group of raiders attacks, the clamorous sound of their Ulfen war songs floats over the din of battle, and the battle plan changes from stealth to intimidation. While Ulfen raiders have a keen sense of tactics, they prefer to fight as bold individuals, rather than in strict formations, in hopes of gaining personal glory. Once battle commences, Ulfen raiders often form a wedge of spears to drive their way through enemy lines. They use shield wall tactics when outnumbered or when they encounter stiff opposition.",
			"",
			"After a successful attack, Ulfen raiders quickly gather loot and valuable captives onto their longships. As well as coins and other riches, the raiders often take bulky luxury goods that are hard to obtain in their homeland, such as well-made furniture or carpets, and even appropriate highpedigree livestock to increase the quality of their own herds. Slaves are often harvested from the ranks of a village's ablebodied youths. While Ulfen raiders seize anything of value that they can bring on board their longships, they are unlikely to wantonly destroy a raided settlement. After all, if the settlement is able to eventually recover from the attack, it can provide more plunder in the next raiding season.",
			"",
			"In large groups, Ulfen raiders can take over a wide area of countryside, and often demand an exorbitant payment from local leaders to move on. Smaller communities frequently pay, rather than attempting the expensive process of raising an army and then fighting an uncertain battle against these bloodthirsty raiders."

Founded in 23 ar by the god Aroden, who commanded soldiers to defend the city walls against the First Siege of Absalom, the First Guard has stood vigil over the city ever since, and its members play a large role in the City at the Center of the World's impenetrable defenses. Thanks to the efforts of the First Guard, the city has never, in the course of its nearly 5 millennia of existence, fallen to either outside invaders or plots from within its walls.",
			"",
			"The First Guard today consists not only of elite soldiers, but also of skilled wizards and scouts who dedicate themselves to uncovering any threats to the safety of the city and to dealing with any dangers as they arise. While each member of the First Guard brings her own talents and training to her post, all soldiers are drilled in melee combat (usually with both a polearm and a sword), military tactics, the laws of Absalom, and the use of siege engines in the event the city's walls should need to be defended at a moment's notice.",

Unlike the city watch, whose duties consist of keeping the peace and policing the city's laws, the First Guard is ever vigilant for threats to the city from both beyond and within its walls. The First Guard wards Azlanti Keep and makes up the core of the Absalom military, commanding other troops-both enlisted and conscripted-in times of war.",
			"",
			"The First Guard is unique in that each soldier within the unit swears an oath to defend the city of Absalom, but not specifically to defend the Grand Council. In the millennia since the First Guard's founding, such a stipulation has saved the city on numerous occasions when the guards' investigations into members of the council uncovered treasonous plots. Bringing these conspiracies to justice has always been a relatively simple matter because no First Guard soldier ever questions where her true loyalties lie."

They rely on strength in numbers and their innate magical powers to capture their prey. A standard tactic is to use their invisibility to hide, then to grow to massive size before attacking. Duergar tend to focus on capturing individuals from races that are already adapted to life in the Darklands, particularly their dwarven kin, but they aren't averse to making slaves of those who originated on the surface or of other Darklands denizens with valuable skills should an easy opportunity arise.",
			"",
			"Those who fall prey to the slavers' traps are usually taken to the slave markets of the duergar capital city of Hagegraf, located beneath the Five Kings Mountains, where they are sold to the highest bidder. The slavers use the threat of sadistic torture to keep their prisoners in line, but they rarely injure their property permanently, and kill slaves even less often. After all, a lame slave is worth less gold at market than one with who has his full physical faculties. Mental scars, in contrast, may actually add value if they help ensure the slave's compliance."

			"Perhaps nowhere in the Inner Sea region are tengus a more common sight than aboard a pirate vessel in the Shackles. Superstitious by nature, many sailors in this region have assigned to these feathered humanoids the dual role of good luck charm and mascot, based on the misguided belief that tengus can absorb ill omens and bad luck. Where this notion came from is anyone's guess, though some scholars have suggested that tengus may have been confused with the chickcharney, with whom they have nothing in common aside from their feathered forms. While this old sailor's conceit may earn such tengus, referred to as \"jinx eaters,\" some special treatment aboard ship, perhaps exempting them from the rough bullying so common in pirate crews, it does not mean they do not have the same responsibilities and duties of all mariners engaged in piracy. Jinx eaters must be able to hold their own in a fight, though most adopt methods of avoiding such conflicts altogether, honing their skills of guile and misdirection instead of brawn and steel.",
			"",
			"Jinx eaters are typically mad for plunder, especially seeking out jewelry and other such baubles, at times even lifting them from unsuspecting shipmates. Such pilfering inevitably leads to angry confrontations onboard, and the kleptomaniacal tengu must rely on his reputation as a source of good luck if he is to be spared a severe beating at the hands of his cohorts.",
			"",
			"Several settlements around the Shackles host rookeries of decent size, and it is common to find retired jinx eaters in such districts; often these are particularly boastful individuals who have given up on the life at sea or have been ousted from their old ship by their increasingly jaded crew members."

			"The graduates of the [Kitharodian Academy](rule/f_bards), Oppara's famed bardic college, number among the Inner Sea region's most talented performers. While members of Taldor's secretive Lion Blades are drawn from the ranks of the college's most gifted students, the vast majority of its graduates go on to promising careers in artistic performance-usually as kitharodes, virtuosos with the traditional Taldan lyre known as the kithara. Often skilled singers as well, kitharodes play the kithara as accompaniment to dances, epic recitations, odes, and songs, as well as the odd solo performance.",
			"",
			"Regardless of their eventual vocation, Kitharodian Academy performers are trained in far more than just music and culture. During their time at the college, students are taught the fine arts of persuasion and deception, and they spend vast amounts of time studying history, languages, law, magical theory, religion, and science, to say nothing of more esoteric subjects. They are drilled in combat as well as magic, and learn to use their performances to sway the thoughts and attitudes of any audience. To successfully pass the rigorous final exams, a prospective graduate must demonstrate that her mind and body have both been honed to keen precision.",
			"",
			"A Kitharodian Academy performer is a darling of Oppara's social scene, and the most accomplished ones find themselves in great demand for the banquets, parties, and receptions hosted by Taldor's aristocratic elite. Kitharodian Academy performers are also frequently skilled duelists, as competition for engagements, noble favors, and prestigious awards is fierce and sometimes violent. A graduate of the academy can easily become a popular celebrity, but fame and fortune are fickle and fleeting, never more so than in Oppara's cutthroat high society-the toast of the town today can find herself penniless and forgotten tomorrow.",
			"",
			"As a result, many Kitharodian Academy performers leave the capital, and some flee Taldor entirely, in search of friendlier audiences who will honestly appreciate them more for their art than for their social standing. Others forsake the performance halls of the cities for the open road, seeking fame of a different sort, drawn by the lure of a life filled with adventure."

Most mystery cults hold at least one of Magnimar's numerous monuments in high esteem, whether for their importance in local traditions or their part in Varisian legends. Practitioners of these religions often congregate around structures such as the Arvensoar, the Irespan, or the Mistress of Angels to practice their faith, sometimes forming assemblies of over a hundred worshipers. Although the cults' gatherings can occasionally be disruptive to the flow of traffic throughout the City of Monuments, Magnimar's leaders do little to dissuade the cults' practices, which are almost wholly harmless and serve to promote life, freedom, and other righteous virtues.",

Sczarni thieves come from many different walks of life. Some are born into Sczarni families, but others grow up in wealthy merchant households and succumb to the urge to pull off complicated burglary schemes. Varisians who join Sczarni families later in life are more closely scrutinized by their superiors than other Sczarni thieves.",

Many a field agent has been extracted from danger in the back of a Sczarni caravan wagon, and just as many Sczarni have tagged along with Pathfinders in order to enter a city where their kind would normally be unwelcome."

Some nobles may hail from families with a long lineage in the city, while others might trace their power to one of Magnimar's numerous merchant houses, and still others might have used inherited or hard-earned wealth to buy their way into the Council of Ushers. In Magnimar, money often speaks louder than words, and those with the coin to spare inevitably rise to power either within the ranks of the council or through the city's various other facets of political strength. While the council is primarily made up of long-lived families who have ruled Magnimar for years, new money has managed to grasp some political power in recent times as Magnimar's importance in trade continues to increase throughout the region.",
			"",
			"When the citizens of Magnimar established their formal government in 4608 ar and instated the Council of Ushers as a means of checking and balancing the power of the lord-mayor, they scarcely thought their seemingly simple political structure would become the convoluted mess it is today. What were originally 15 seats on the council belonging to the most influential and significant families of Magnimar have since ballooned into 117 seats filled by blas&eacute; nobles, scheming aristocrats, and avaricious merchants. Though there remain some honest members of the council who faithfully seek to represent the will of Magnimar's citizenry, such honorable endeavors are more often than not stopped up in the city's byzantine political machine.",
			"",
			"While most of the city's day-to-day business runs on the up and up, corruption and bribery find their way into numerous facets of the city-state's governing body. Spies and aristocratic messengers from Korvosa often travel to Magnimar bearing ill will or financial threats against its councilors, swaying corrupt politicians to aid their cause as the rival city-state to the east attempts to absorb one or more of Magnimar's holdings. Many of the representatives in the Council of Ushers work toward improving Magnimar's holdings and status, though some seek instead to undermine progress and sabotage their counterparts' efforts, putting personal goals and aspirations before the good of the citizens. Agents from Cheliax and Korvosa spend a significant amount of coin in their attempts to subvert the council and sow seeds of destruction among Magnimar, and these traitors to the City of Monuments are easily among the most prominent threats to the city."

Tavern owners gift brawlers with free drinks and meals after a successful bout, and canny bartenders often sponsor gladiatorial warriors, using their local celebrity to drum up more business and set their establishment apart from the rest. Such subsidized fighters are usually garnered from among the many toughs that frequent Magnimar's dives, and one can never be sure when an accidental bar brawl might turn into a potential business opportunity."

Followers of the Reaper of Reputation may guide Skinsaw cultists toward choice targets, using them as tools to enact their political machinations, preferring that those they wish dead be slain by a fellow Norgorberite. Many who follow Norgorber's fourth aspect, that of the Gray Master, tend to avoid Skinsaw cultists unless they have a need to sow chaos and terror. While they believe murder is certainly a tool of thievery, it is a secondary aspect, and makes for a sloppier job in the eyes of their masked deity.",

Occasionally, however, a Skinsaw cultist receives a calling from her god to travel the world and leave a wake of murder and mayhem in her wake. In these instances, such a slayer would likely seek out safe havens in unfamiliar ports, relying on her compatriots to guide her to choice targets in each new city.",

The Wave Riders defend local ships from monsters that are summoned by enemies or that rise from the depths of their own accord, and use their speed and maneuverability to observe and occasionally harass enemy ships. Though they lack a heavy cavalry's capabilities, Wave Riders are adept at approaching smaller ships and boarding before the lookouts even know they are there.

The berserkers also gather lichens from the center of the island-not for nourishment, but because these can provide euphoric visions or fuel the berserkers' battle rage.

			"In 4648 AR, just 16 years after gaining their independence from the empire of Cheliax and while still reeling in the wake of Aroden's death, the people of Nirmathas once again struggled for their freedom, this time from their new liege nation, Molthune. Their militaristic overlords offered little to the freedom-loving forest-dwellers of Nirmathas that Imperial Cheliax hadn't, and so, led by a skilled half-elven ranger named Irgal Nirmath, the people of the Fangwood rebelled against their Molthuni oppressors. After 7 hard-fought years at war and a number of victorious skirmishes, Nirmathas at last prevailed and earned its freedom.",
			"",
			"Now, nearly 60 years later, the war for Nirmathi independence is over, but violent conflict between the nations of Molthune and Nirmathas continues. In the dense woods of the southern Fangwood, a region known as the Chernasardo, Molthuni armies constantly seek to regain territory lost in the prior war and in skirmishes since its official end, marching garrisons of troops into various parts of the Fangwood on a nearly daily basis. But the highly regimented, heavily armored soldiers of Molthune are not well equipped for maneuvers in the deep forest, and the people of the Chernasardo use this to their advantage.",
			"",
			"The woodsmen of Nirmathas continue the hit-and-run tactics that worked so well for their fledgling nation's namesake. Generally working in teams of six or fewer, these elite snipers, trappers, and scouts are both stealthy and prudent enough to ambush large contingents of Molthuni soldiers and escape without ever being spotted. Each sniper is usually equipped with a number of specialty arrows designed for use in specific situations. This makes the snipers both unpredictable and deadly, a combination that never ceases to frustrate the commanders of Molthune's army as they attempt to bring the people of Nirmathas-whom they still see as rebellious citizens of Molthune rather than foreign nationals-to heel."

Not all see the failure of prophecy as so certain, however; most notable among them are the Harbingers of Fate. This Absalom-based secret society may seem like a band of lunatics unable to cope with their philosophy being negated by the passing of time, but in fact they pose a real threat to the safety of the City at the Center of the World. After all, nothing is more important to the Harbingers of Fate than restoring prophecy, even if doing so causes the deaths of thousands of innocents.",

			"Founded in 4648 AR by Lord Garron, an exiled Chelish noble living in Absalom, the Harbingers believe that bringing about the prophesies foretold the mysterious Book of 1,000 Whispers will put history back on its proper course and usher in the promised Age of Glory, perhaps even returning of Aroden himself to the world. But like all other forms of soothsaying, the writings in the Book of 1,000 Whispers-accurate up until 4606 AR-lost all reliability in predicting the future after Aroden's demise. Lord Garron desperately (and fruitlessly) tried to fulfill these prophecies for the remainder of his life, before dying in one such failed attempt. His daughter Lady Arodeth continues his work today and leads the small but fanatical group of disciples of the Book of 1,000 Whispers in Absalom. The Harbingers' methods have been growing more and more desperate in recent years, as the book's final pronouncements are said to occur in 4714 AR; so far, none of them have come true."

Though not necessarily well schooled, some enforcers are selected for their cunning, intuition, and ability to motivate underlings by finding methods that keep people in line.",

Occasionally, the enforcers' strong-arm tactics do elicit useful information about people working outside the company's control, but for many enforcers the bullying is its own reward, and a means to maintain a climate of fear and control."

Beyond simply their aspirations and fervor, initiate Red Mantis assassins also benefit from their lack of iconic armor, mask, and in some cases even sawtooth sabres.

			"Since time immemorial, the people of Sarkoris have embraced an immense number of deities, outsiders, guardian spirits, and legendary beings as part of their ever-changing regional pantheons. Each Sarkorian community boasted its own pantheon of patrons, with characters from folklore and history standing alongside true supernatural beings as objects of distinct local importance and worship. Passing on the tales of these figures and giving form to the faiths of their people were the god callers. For each god caller, and for those who looked to these magic-users as leaders, an eidolon was not just a mysterious being brought forth by magic-it was an embodiment of the divine, the manifestation of a being they believed to be a true god.",
			"",
			"God callers are aptly named, as they were traditionally held by the people of Sarkoris-laymen in matters of arcane and divine magic, but no more ignorant than most commoners-as the only mortals able to communicate with and conjure their \"gods.\" In rural Sarkoris, the distinctions between deities, demigods, powerful outsiders, summoned entities, and pure fictions blurred to such an extent that summoners were considered spiritual leaders, and stood alongside the druids, clerics, witches, and clerics that guided the clans of that land. Each eidolon is different, conjured as much from the strange realms where those creatures originate as from the imaginations, history, and tales of the Sarkorian people. Some eidolons are even inherited, after a fashion, with elder summoners passing on the techniques for calling their conjured allies to their offspring or apprentices so their gods might go on to serve the next generation. While most god callers understand that their eidolons are not the almighty deities of grand churches and world-spanning faiths, most are not insincere with their belief in their summoned creatures' divinity. Most view their eidolons as manifestations of greater beings, spirits of fallen heroes, children of legendary creatures, or the gods of small things - like a particular well, road, town, or family.",
			"",
			"During Sarkoris's height, most god callers were benevolent, calling on their eidolons to aid and protect their communities from the many dangers of the rugged north. But some called upon angry gods, and served as the mouthpieces of beings that demanded worship, fear, and terrible offerings. Fortunately, Sarkoris was a land of many deities and ever-changing regional pantheons, ensuring that the petty tyrannies of such wicked god callers and their small gods were regularly confronted by the summoners of nearby lands, or sometimes even by another in the same town.",
			"",
			"The first god caller was Domora Hume, who famously called the heavily armored god-creature called Dyzad, a spiny, crustacean-like creature that could fire its poisonous spines at enemies. With its aid, Domora repulsed a force of Mammoth Lord raiders and established the tradition of god calling across Sarkoris. So inspiring was Dyzad that many who studied under Domora or simply emulated her called lesser versions of her famed ally. In the ages since, many of the entities and legendary characters worshiped in Sarkoris as deities have taken the form of eidolons. Among them are such beings as the Dragoneagles of Neverhome, Aienu the Wall, Sister Last Tear, the Shackled Shadows of Rauglain, Alep's Steed, the Torches of Dawn, and Clanliege Histunsun. Thousands of other deities and eidolons were once known in Sarkoris, but most either have been lost, or are remembered only in legends and on the rare broken monoliths known as godstones.",
			"",
			"With the destruction of Sarkoris and the exodus of its surviving people, god callers found themselves in a world with vastly different religious traditions. In the less clannish lands, divorced from the ancient Kellid beliefs of Sarkoris, the tradition of god calling was largely viewed as ignorant at best and as outright heresy at worse. As a result, many god callers were shunned, or even hunted, for their strange beliefs and for the monstrous company they kept. Many sought out quiet and hidden places where they might continue to practice and share the traditions of Lost Sarkoris, surviving in small groups at the edges of the Worldwound, in the Tusk Mountains, in the Graidmere Swamp, in the Estrovian Forest, and beyond. Still others took the destruction of their home as a sign-as evidence that it was time to spread their beliefs to a world of complacent, distant deities. These god callers have struck out on their own, spreading the tales of their people and their storied eidolons, or even founding new cults devoted to their gods. Some have even allied with the churches of existing deities, allying their eidolons with the faiths and true gods that share similar beliefs and purposes. The tradition of god calling might be fractured, but it's far from dead.",
			"",
			"Today, some of the world's most active god callers continue to work in and around the Worldwound. The town of Valahuv in the Worldwound survives against the demonic hordes largely thanks to the efforts of Feinroh Balemoon (LN male human summoner 4), his eidolon Tammerri the Dawncaller, and a mysterious other patron. Similarly, the Sarkorian town of Gundrun is home to the determined god caller Alase Brinz-Widowknife (NG female human summoner 5) and her wolf like eidolon Tonbarse. Hidden away in the Graidmere Swamp, in the dark holy place called Baallalota, Clanliege Lesaul Blackearth (NE female changeling summoner 10) guides the remnants of her proud clan in their reverence for the Mother of Fangs, the snake-like spirit of the swamp-and perhaps something more."
