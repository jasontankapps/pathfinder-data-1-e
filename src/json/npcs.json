Sometimes Ulfen raiders might put in at a nearby, uninhabited harbor so as to approach their quarry on foot from inland, using nearby terrain as cover. However they approach, the raiders aim to catch their prize unawares to prevent their prey from fleeing with valuable plunder. When a group of raiders attacks, the clamorous sound of their Ulfen war songs floats over the din of battle, and the battle plan changes from stealth to intimidation. While Ulfen raiders have a keen sense of tactics, they prefer to fight as bold individuals, rather than in strict formations, in hopes of gaining personal glory. Once battle commences, Ulfen raiders often form a wedge of spears to drive their way through enemy lines. They use shield wall tactics when outnumbered or when they encounter stiff opposition.",
			"",
			"After a successful attack, Ulfen raiders quickly gather loot and valuable captives onto their longships. As well as coins and other riches, the raiders often take bulky luxury goods that are hard to obtain in their homeland, such as well-made furniture or carpets, and even appropriate highpedigree livestock to increase the quality of their own herds. Slaves are often harvested from the ranks of a village's ablebodied youths. While Ulfen raiders seize anything of value that they can bring on board their longships, they are unlikely to wantonly destroy a raided settlement. After all, if the settlement is able to eventually recover from the attack, it can provide more plunder in the next raiding season.",
			"",
			"In large groups, Ulfen raiders can take over a wide area of countryside, and often demand an exorbitant payment from local leaders to move on. Smaller communities frequently pay, rather than attempting the expensive process of raising an army and then fighting an uncertain battle against these bloodthirsty raiders."

Founded in 23 ar by the god Aroden, who commanded soldiers to defend the city walls against the First Siege of Absalom, the First Guard has stood vigil over the city ever since, and its members play a large role in the City at the Center of the World's impenetrable defenses. Thanks to the efforts of the First Guard, the city has never, in the course of its nearly 5 millennia of existence, fallen to either outside invaders or plots from within its walls.",
			"",
			"The First Guard today consists not only of elite soldiers, but also of skilled wizards and scouts who dedicate themselves to uncovering any threats to the safety of the city and to dealing with any dangers as they arise. While each member of the First Guard brings her own talents and training to her post, all soldiers are drilled in melee combat (usually with both a polearm and a sword), military tactics, the laws of Absalom, and the use of siege engines in the event the city's walls should need to be defended at a moment's notice.",
			"",
			"Members of the First Guard serve in a much more militaristic role than their counterparts on the city watch, with whom they share their headquarters in Azlanti Keep. Unlike the city watch, whose duties consist of keeping the peace and policing the city's laws, the First Guard is ever vigilant for threats to the city from both beyond and within its walls. The First Guard wards Azlanti Keep and makes up the core of the Absalom military, commanding other troops-both enlisted and conscripted-in times of war.",
			"",
			"The First Guard is unique in that each soldier within the unit swears an oath to defend the city of Absalom, but not specifically to defend the Grand Council. In the millennia since the First Guard's founding, such a stipulation has saved the city on numerous occasions when the guards' investigations into members of the council uncovered treasonous plots. Bringing these conspiracies to justice has always been a relatively simple matter because no First Guard soldier ever questions where her true loyalties lie."

			"Among the Eagle Knights, the members of the Steel Falcons faction serve as Andoran's armed ambassadors to the world at large. While the larger part of the Eagle Knights is concerned with the nation's safety and order, the Steel Falcons travel abroad to bring awareness of the history and culture of Andoran to other lands and to spread the gospel of liberty. They travel not as seditionists (unless they are subverting tyranny), but rather as emissaries sharing the national narrative that makes Andoran unique among the nations. They are also trained listeners, culling important intelligence from information commonly available in the foreign lands they roam, returning to Andoran with invaluable details about attitudes and activities abroad."

A Hellknight is an instrument of unyielding, inevitable order. Every Hellknight knows that she and her fellows are the tools by which society will be broken and remade in accordance with the teachings of their code, which they call \"The Measure and the Chain.\" By that code, all who live must be forced to obey the law.

			"",
			"An armiger also studies the lore of Hell of the infernal realms. This study serves two purposes. First, it allows her to understand and apply infernal law without mercy-valued because that infernal realm is an unflinching example of absolute order. Second, it prepares her to do battle with Hell's minions. These battles are required for admittance into the ranks of the Hellknights, but they continue throughout a knight's development, as her courage and strength are constantly tested to ensure that she remains worthy.",
			"",
			"Hellknight armigers are most likely to be found in the lands and towns surrounding their order's citadel. Because they are not yet full Hellknights, they may not travel outside of the areas controlled by their order without permission. When they do travel with a contingent of Hellknights, it is usually as part of a test of discipline, loyalty, or courage. Those who fail are subjected to the same terrible punishments as any who break the law."

			"Perhaps nowhere in the Inner Sea region are tengus a more common sight than aboard a pirate vessel in the Shackles. Superstitious by nature, many sailors in this region have assigned to these feathered humanoids the dual role of good luck charm and mascot, based on the misguided belief that tengus can absorb ill omens and bad luck. Where this notion came from is anyone's guess, though some scholars have suggested that tengus may have been confused with the chickcharney, with whom they have nothing in common aside from their feathered forms. While this old sailor's conceit may earn such tengus, referred to as \"jinx eaters,\" some special treatment aboard ship, perhaps exempting them from the rough bullying so common in pirate crews, it does not mean they do not have the same responsibilities and duties of all mariners engaged in piracy. Jinx eaters must be able to hold their own in a fight, though most adopt methods of avoiding such conflicts altogether, honing their skills of guile and misdirection instead of brawn and steel.",

			"Just as the legendary Mistress Ordellia Whilwren once prayed to a mysterious angel to save Magnimar from a devastating deluge, other dwellers of the city have likewise devoted themselves to holy figures, including angels, azatas, and agathions. Called \"mystery cultists\" by most Magnimarians because of their small numbers and esoteric manner of worship, the dedicated followers of the empyreal lords keep to themselves and rarely proselytize. Most mystery cults hold at least one of Magnimar's numerous monuments in high esteem, whether for their importance in local traditions or their part in Varisian legends. Practitioners of these religions often congregate around structures such as the Arvensoar, the Irespan, or the Mistress of Angels to practice their faith, sometimes forming assemblies of over a hundred worshipers. Although the cults' gatherings can occasionally be disruptive to the flow of traffic throughout the City of Monuments, Magnimar's leaders do little to dissuade the cults' practices, which are almost wholly harmless and serve to promote life, freedom, and other righteous virtues.",
			"",
			"Three of the most commonly worshiped figures among the mystery cults of Magnimar are the empyreal lords Ashava, Soralyon, and Ylimancha (see page 25 for more information on these empyreal lords), though smaller cults to other celestial beings are not uncommon in the City of Monuments."

Many a field agent has been extracted from danger in the back of a Sczarni caravan wagon, and just as many Sczarni have tagged along with Pathfinders in order to enter a city where their kind would normally be unwelcome."

			"The shifty noble represents any one of the dozens of aristocrats vying for power and wealth in Magnimar. Some nobles may hail from families with a long lineage in the city, while others might trace their power to one of Magnimar's numerous merchant houses, and still others might have used inherited or hard-earned wealth to buy their way into the Council of Ushers. In Magnimar, money often speaks louder than words, and those with the coin to spare inevitably rise to power either within the ranks of the council or through the city's various other facets of political strength. While the council is primarily made up of long-lived families who have ruled Magnimar for years, new money has managed to grasp some political power in recent times as Magnimar's importance in trade continues to increase throughout the region.",
			"",
			"When the citizens of Magnimar established their formal government in 4608 ar and instated the Council of Ushers as a means of checking and balancing the power of the lord-mayor, they scarcely thought their seemingly simple political structure would become the convoluted mess it is today. What were originally 15 seats on the council belonging to the most influential and significant families of Magnimar have since ballooned into 117 seats filled by blas&eacute; nobles, scheming aristocrats, and avaricious merchants. Though there remain some honest members of the council who faithfully seek to represent the will of Magnimar's citizenry, such honorable endeavors are more often than not stopped up in the city's byzantine political machine.",
			"",
			"While most of the city's day-to-day business runs on the up and up, corruption and bribery find their way into numerous facets of the city-state's governing body. Spies and aristocratic messengers from Korvosa often travel to Magnimar bearing ill will or financial threats against its councilors, swaying corrupt politicians to aid their cause as the rival city-state to the east attempts to absorb one or more of Magnimar's holdings. Many of the representatives in the Council of Ushers work toward improving Magnimar's holdings and status, though some seek instead to undermine progress and sabotage their counterparts' efforts, putting personal goals and aspirations before the good of the citizens. Agents from Cheliax and Korvosa spend a significant amount of coin in their attempts to subvert the council and sow seeds of destruction among Magnimar, and these traitors to the City of Monuments are easily among the most prominent threats to the city."

Tavern owners gift brawlers with free drinks and meals after a successful bout, and canny bartenders often sponsor gladiatorial warriors, using their local celebrity to drum up more business and set their establishment apart from the rest. Such subsidized fighters are usually garnered from among the many toughs that frequent Magnimar's dives, and one can never be sure when an accidental bar brawl might turn into a potential business opportunity."

This is not for any sort of political gain, but rather to offer Norgorber only the best possible sacrifices.",

Those who revere Blackfingers may work with Skinsaw cultists in order to provide their deadly poisons for the Skinsaw cultists' blades, more concerned about proliferating poison than the act of murder. Followers of the Reaper of Reputation may guide Skinsaw cultists toward choice targets, using them as tools to enact their political machinations, preferring that those they wish dead be slain by a fellow Norgorberite. Many who follow Norgorber's fourth aspect, that of the Gray Master, tend to avoid Skinsaw cultists unless they have a need to sow chaos and terror. While they believe murder is certainly a tool of thievery, it is a secondary aspect, and makes for a sloppier job in the eyes of their masked deity.",
			"",
			"Skinsaw cultists rarely interact with followers of Father Skinsaw from different cells, each city typically hosting only one such cult. That said, when a fellow cultist comes through a foreign town, a local cell will always take her in temporarily, sometimes even urging her to kill while there. Occasionally, however, a Skinsaw cultist receives a calling from her god to travel the world and leave a wake of murder and mayhem in her wake. In these instances, such a slayer would likely seek out safe havens in unfamiliar ports, relying on her compatriots to guide her to choice targets in each new city."

The Wave Riders defend local ships from monsters that are summoned by enemies or that rise from the depths of their own accord, and use their speed and maneuverability to observe and occasionally harass enemy ships. Though they lack a heavy cavalry's capabilities, Wave Riders are adept at approaching smaller ships and boarding before the lookouts even know they are there. Usually, only those who would harm Absalom by way of the sea need fear the Wave Riders, but they also aren't above assisting with anti-smuggling raids from time to time.",

No nefarious plot has yet surfaced, however. Statistics for hippocampi can be found on page 155 of Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 2."

The crops serve as a contingency for times when the berserkers can find neither human nor beast to slaughter. The berserkers also gather lichens from the center of the island-not for nourishment, but because these can provide euphoric visions or fuel the berserkers' battle rage. Continued consumption of these lichens is the cause of the Kalva berserkers' white eyes."

In addition, having thwarted death once, the bleachling does not visibly age until death claims her several centuries later.

Most gnomes find bleachlings extremely unsettling-living reminders of the undesirable fate that awaits if they're idle.",

			"The woodsmen of Nirmathas continue the hit-and-run tactics that worked so well for their fledgling nation's namesake. Generally working in teams of six or fewer, these elite snipers, trappers, and scouts are both stealthy and prudent enough to ambush large contingents of Molthuni soldiers and escape without ever being spotted. Each sniper is usually equipped with a number of specialty arrows designed for use in specific situations. This makes the snipers both unpredictable and deadly, a combination that never ceases to frustrate the commanders of Molthune's army as they attempt to bring the people of Nirmathas-whom they still see as rebellious citizens of Molthune rather than foreign nationals-to heel."

But like all other forms of soothsaying, the writings in the Book of 1,000 Whispers-accurate up until 4606 AR-lost all reliability in predicting the future after Aroden's demise. Lord Garron desperately (and fruitlessly) tried to fulfill these prophecies for the remainder of his life, before dying in one such failed attempt. His daughter Lady Arodeth continues his work today and leads the small but fanatical group of disciples of the Book of 1,000 Whispers in Absalom.

In reality, enforcers' responsibilities within the company vary wildly based on the talent of the individuals and the whims of their overseers. Though not necessarily well schooled, some enforcers are selected for their cunning, intuition, and ability to motivate underlings by finding methods that keep people in line.",
			"",
			"Since the Lumber Consortium considers itself the de facto authority in the lands it claims, these enforcers often take on the role of a police force. While a few do their best to maintain order and pursue justice, others spend more time spying on the populace and arresting people for \"interfering with company business.\" Those living in areas controlled by the consortium are often subjected to threats, intimidation, and even beatings. Occasionally, the enforcers' strong-arm tactics do elicit useful information about people working outside the company's control, but for many enforcers the bullying is its own reward, and a means to maintain a climate of fear and control."

Beyond simply their aspirations and fervor, initiate Red Mantis assassins also benefit from their lack of iconic armor, mask, and in some cases even sawtooth sabres. Such assassins can more easily mask the threat they present to a potential target long past when a more experienced Red Mantis assassin would be revealed, a fact that helps make up for their less advanced training.",

			"A pilgrim often works alone, but two or three might staff a remote clinic (CR 5 or 6). Pilgrims can also be found in groups of four, often accompanied by four caravan guards or eight acolytes (CR 8). A single pilgrim may be served by a guard, caravan guard, or pair of acolytes (CR 4). A pilgrim in turn might serve under a shaman (CR 6), while an evil pilgrim may work with a torturer, helping to keep prisoners alive (CR 6)."

Bronze agents are made up of Magnimar's dockworkers, freelancers, and lowly adventurers seeking money and improved status, while those agents wielding silver emblems organize the activities of their underlings throughout the regions surrounding the city. Only a couple gold agents operate in Magnimar, though their influence and power extends to nearly all the corners of Varisia, and their word is law as far as lesser agents are concerned.",

If these duties spare her any time, a Besmaran priest goes out of her way to assist others in their tasks onboard and learn everything there is to know about running a ship and crew, for there is no telling what duties will be required aboard Besmara's own Seawraith should the cleric earn a coveted berth in the afterlife.

Watch captains train in deadlier weapons than their more common counterparts, and most prefer to wield two blades at a given time; like city guards, however, they prefer to use nonlethal means to handle minor crimes, and are adept at disarming their opponents with their swordbreaker daggers."

Many serve with a true heart of civic duty, doing their best to raise the fortunes of all in their land.",

Many corrupt politicians seek out office hoping to use its power to increase their own wealth and prestige, while others are slowly seduced by the ease with which their power allows them to cut corners, demand favors, and solve personal problems with wealth they hold in trust for the good of their constituents.",
			"",
			"Politicians who have abandoned their public trust have numerous opportunities to use their position for personal gain. They manipulate policy and procedure to serve their own ends using any means at their disposal. Personal charm and political chicanery are weapons in their hands, as they forestall efforts at reform by misappropriating funds and channeling them to themselves or their allies. Corrupt politicians seek their own advantage at every turn, using bribery and misinformation to obstruct investigations and frame their rivals for their own wrongdoings.",

This self-serving belief allows such politicians to convince themselves that using their positions to assist with illegal smuggling, racketeering, gambling, and abuse of the political process is an acceptable cost of winning support for building orphanages and feeding the poor. Only a few corrupt politicians stoop to violence and extortion, though many who wish to restrict themselves to \"victimless\" crimes find themselves involved in ever-darker deeds as their careers progress.",

			"Those fallen politicians who believe they do little true harm can sometimes be redeemed. A few turn their backs on their criminal allies upon seeing the damage done by their perversion of the democratic system, while others must be threatened with potential exposure or prosecution before changing their ways."

			"Since time immemorial, the people of Sarkoris have embraced an immense number of deities, outsiders, guardian spirits, and legendary beings as part of their ever-changing regional pantheons. Each Sarkorian community boasted its own pantheon of patrons, with characters from folklore and history standing alongside true supernatural beings as objects of distinct local importance and worship. Passing on the tales of these figures and giving form to the faiths of their people were the god callers. For each god caller, and for those who looked to these magic-users as leaders, an eidolon was not just a mysterious being brought forth by magic-it was an embodiment of the divine, the manifestation of a being they believed to be a true god.",
			"",
			"God callers are aptly named, as they were traditionally held by the people of Sarkoris-laymen in matters of arcane and divine magic, but no more ignorant than most commoners-as the only mortals able to communicate with and conjure their \"gods.\" In rural Sarkoris, the distinctions between deities, demigods, powerful outsiders, summoned entities, and pure fictions blurred to such an extent that summoners were considered spiritual leaders, and stood alongside the druids, clerics, witches, and clerics that guided the clans of that land. Each eidolon is different, conjured as much from the strange realms where those creatures originate as from the imaginations, history, and tales of the Sarkorian people. Some eidolons are even inherited, after a fashion, with elder summoners passing on the techniques for calling their conjured allies to their offspring or apprentices so their gods might go on to serve the next generation. While most god callers understand that their eidolons are not the almighty deities of grand churches and world-spanning faiths, most are not insincere with their belief in their summoned creatures' divinity. Most view their eidolons as manifestations of greater beings, spirits of fallen heroes, children of legendary creatures, or the gods of small things-like a particular well, road, town, or family.",
			"",
			"During Sarkoris's height, most god callers were benevolent, calling on their eidolons to aid and protect their communities from the many dangers of the rugged north. But some called upon angry gods, and served as the mouthpieces of beings that demanded worship, fear, and terrible offerings. Fortunately, Sarkoris was a land of many deities and ever-changing regional pantheons, ensuring that the petty tyrannies of such wicked god callers and their small gods were regularly confronted by the summoners of nearby lands, or sometimes even by another in the same town.",
			"",
			"The first god caller was Domora Hume, who famously called the heavily armored god-creature called Dyzad, a spiny, crustacean-like creature that could fire its poisonous spines at enemies. With its aid, Domora repulsed a force of Mammoth Lord raiders and established the tradition of god calling across Sarkoris. So inspiring was Dyzad that many who studied under Domora or simply emulated her called lesser versions of her famed ally. In the ages since, many of the entities and legendary characters worshiped in Sarkoris as deities have taken the form of eidolons. Among them are such beings as the Dragoneagles of Neverhome, Aienu the Wall, Sister Last Tear, the Shackled Shadows of Rauglain, Alep's Steed, the Torches of Dawn, and Clanliege Histunsun. Thousands of other deities and eidolons were once known in Sarkoris, but most either have been lost, or are remembered only in legends and on the rare broken monoliths known as godstones. More details on Sarkoris, its god callers, and their many \"deities\" can be found in Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Lost Kingdoms.",
			"",
			"With the destruction of Sarkoris and the exodus of its surviving people, god callers found themselves in a world with vastly different religious traditions. In the less clannish lands, divorced from the ancient Kellid beliefs of Sarkoris, the tradition of god calling was largely viewed as ignorant at best and as outright heresy at worse. As a result, many god callers were shunned, or even hunted, for their strange beliefs and for the monstrous company they kept. Many sought out quiet and hidden places where they might continue to practice and share the traditions of Lost Sarkoris, surviving in small groups at the edges of the Worldwound, in the Tusk Mountains, in the Graidmere Swamp, in the Estrovian Forest, and beyond. Still others took the destruction of their home as a sign-as evidence that it was time to spread their beliefs to a world of complacent, distant deities. These god callers have struck out on their own, spreading the tales of their people and their storied eidolons, or even founding new cults devoted to their gods. Some have even allied with the churches of existing deities, allying their eidolons with the faiths and true gods that share similar beliefs and purposes. The tradition of god calling might be fractured, but it's far from dead.",
			"",
			"Today, some of the world's most active god callers continue to work in and around the Worldwound. The town of Valahuv in the Worldwound survives against the demonic hordes largely thanks to the efforts of Feinroh Balemoon (LN male human summoner 4), his eidolon Tammerri the Dawncaller, and a mysterious other patron. Similarly, the Sarkorian town of Gundrun is home to the determined god caller Alase Brinz-Widowknife (NG female human summoner 5) and her wolf like eidolon Tonbarse. Hidden away in the Graidmere Swamp, in the dark holy place called Baallalota, Clanliege Lesaul Blackearth (NE female changeling summoner 10) guides the remnants of her proud clan in their reverence for the Mother of Fangs, the snake-like spirit of the swamp-and perhaps something more."

Some assume that since Mandar lives in the wild she has a grudge against civilization, like many druids do. This isn't the case; she simply prefers solitude. In fact, she loves some creature comforts, and might trade spellcasting services or information to nearby villages in exchange for food, clothing, or sweets for both herself and her familiar, Eink.

An accomplished sailor herself, she has the ability to motivate her crew to work in unison and give their best effort-and indeed, to fight and die as necessary.

Many longship captains prefer to follow coastlines, and at night have their boats seek safe harbor so that the crew can sleep in tents on the nearby shore-in such cases, the captain herself claims the privilege of the sleeping onboard, possibly with an honor guard or skeleton crew to prevent thieves or accidents. If an enemy attacks during the night, the high-walled hull of the ship can serve as an impromptu fortification.",

Most longboat captains are certainly capable in melee combat, but prefer to issue orders and provide support with their arrows from a vantage point from which they can observe the whole battle-often the bows of their ships. A captain's swift reactions, as well as her ability to yell a hasty word of warning or command to her crew, can determine whether she and her crew face victory or defeat, life or death.",
			"",
			"When engaged in coastal raiding, the captain supervises the planning of the attack. She often leads a reserve group of raiders to strike against the strongest points of resistance or cut off those trying to flee. Those assigned to the captain's guard see the post as a mark of honor, as well as a chance for a greater share of the loot.",

This extreme prejudice is viewed as an important survival instinct that's necessary for any who hope to make it in the unforgiving Cinderlands environment.",

Anyone who is not Shoanti is an outsider in their eyes, but their true hatred is reserved for those of obvious Chelish or orc blood, the blood of their greatest current foes. Regardless, though, all outsiders are invaders, and invaders must be killed. Burn riders are the most likely warriors to be sent to deal with such foes.",

			"On rare occasions, outsiders may participate in the burn run as a means of gaining honorary membership into the quah. In such cases, the hopefuls often have an even harder task before them than their Shoanti counterparts, as unaccepting members of the quah often work together to ensure they don't survive.",

			"While magic such as endure elements or protection from energy could aid a burn rider in their task, the Shoanti see the use of such spells as dishonorable and consider such methods of surviving the burn run shameful and beneath them.",
			"",
			"To conquer their fear, burn riders train themselves and their mounts to ride through the brushfires that often ignite in the Cinderlands. As such, neither they nor their mounts fear any challenge. They will not back down no matter the foe."

			"Sodden scavenger is a term used by many to refer to the destitute and storm-beaten survivors who make the Sodden Lands their homes. The hardy people that eke out their lives in the Sodden Lands group together for survival. Extended families often provide the spine of these communities. Many refer to the collections of sodden scavengers as gangs, which in many ways they are. Though the scavengers see their survival as a triumph, they live in an anarchic land where the laws of one community may not be those of another. These autocratic communities range in population from barely two dozen into the hundreds.",
			"",
			"The gangs residing in the reclaimed cities of windblasted Jula, the tangle of towers remaining of Hyrantam, and sunken Oagon also count among those whom foreigners call the sodden scavengers. The strongest of these gangs is the ironically named Knights of Abendego, whose reach for territory has been expanding in recent years. Other gangs such as the reptile-wrangling Crocodile Raiders, the metal-salvaging Machine Union, the diseased and drug-dealing Possum Gang, the mystical cult known as Three Prong, and the skygazing descendants of the Lirgeni known as the An-Ydak-as well as dozens of others-all stake their claims on the apocalyptic lands of the Abendego Gulf.",
			"",
			"In addition to battling with each other, sodden scavengers frequently compete for resources and territory among themselves-that is, when they're not too busy fighting off the tribes of boggards and lizardfolk who also dwell in the region. The Koboto tribes in the south, said to be the descendants of the lost nation of Yamasa, pose a further threat to the holdings of the sodden scavengers. In the far southern coast of the Sodden Lands, a pirate town known as Greenblood hosts an annual bloodsport event called Green Blood on a Black Rock that brings pirates from the Shackles and beyond to the Sodden Lands, leaving the sodden scavengers with yet more foes in the harsh and daunting region."

In the time since, the cult has flourished in Thuvia, where in the vast deserts of that nation the House of Oblivion stands as a permanent marker of Ahriman's presence. Usij blend in with desert societies, keeping their dedication to their lord a secret while spreading ruin and social decay.",

Other Usij cabalists spend their efforts to destroy bonds of family, friends, and faith. They maneuver themselves into relationships with troubled people who are easy to sway, and avoid getting their own hands dirty by persuading the desperate to commit ruinous acts. Many Usij are skilled alchemists and entire cells are dedicated to refining deadly poisons and powerful drugs.",
			"",
			"These div-callers and agents of catastrophe sometimes gather in secret societies within urban areas or inhabit desert complexes far from scrutiny. Any large cell of Usij is likely to include at least one div that associates with the cell, typically a pairaka or sepid, and many Usij sorcerers and wizards call dorus as familiars. Usij cabals operate independently of each other, but they always pursue the same goal: ruin. Recent rumors claim a cabal of Usij alchemists have joined with a great wyrm blue dragon and are scouring the desert for sun orchids in order to synthesize their own version of the sun orchid elixir. Some say that certain Usij leaders meet annually at a secret location somewhere in central Casmaron, but this may be only whispers on paranoid lips."

			"Eggal is a friendly, outgoing young halfling, generous with his spirit, spirits, money, and affection-but not particularly bright. Fortunately, Eggal is so likable and headstrong that few ever try to take advantage of him, and those who do discover that his lack of \"book learning\" hasn't done anything to dull his innate cunning, and he remembers who has done him wrong every bit as well as he recalls who has done him favors, repaying both with interest. He wants to see the world and enjoy life, and doesn't particularly care whether people are good or selfish as long they don't try to hurt him or anyone he cares about-to him, his god's creed of freedom above all means accepting that some people were born mean-spirited, and are entitled to their pettiness and jealousy as long as they don't go out of their way to oppress others. For his own part, he'd rather help someone than ignore a request for aid, and has been known to expound at length upon the simple joys of helping others. He avoids killing unless absolutely necessary, even among those more \"monstrous\" humanoid races, but hates undead with a passion and goes out of his way to destroy such abominations.",
			"",
			"**Combat Encounters:** Though he is hard to influence with magic, clever lies and subtle manipulation can easily turn Eggal against the PCs, and it's not uncommon for him to come into conflict with the lawful authorities in a region if he feels they are profiting at the expense of the common people. If he sees the PCs as agents of oppression, regardless of their justifications, he's likely to oppose them-with his mace if necessary. Because of his reluctance to kill, he is useful for an encounter where the PCs should negotiate or surrender instead of fighting.",
			"",
			"**Roleplaying Suggestions:** Eggal can be a reliable feature of local taverns, even showing up in other cities where the PCs travel. Because he tends to help when asked, he might end up in over his head and need rescuing, or have friends in need of rescue. He can also help out the PCs as an ally against undead, as a backup healer, or as a contact in Cayden Cailean's church."

Among these ranks, the Night Scale assassins are perhaps the most feared members of the thieves' guild. Such assassins are responsible for taking care of nosy adventurers or pesky guards who don't know to mind their own business. Night Scale assassins work to silence some of Magnimar's mouthiest nobles as well as its uncorrupted political figures, and it is rumored that if one can get a hold of the shadowy gang, private parties might be able to arrange an assassination for a steep price.",

Thus, an escort of three to 12 guards is likely to be found around any visiting dignitary or Ruby Prince Khemet III's twin younger siblings, Ojan and Jasilia. Both twins are fond of exploring the forgotten wonders of Osirion's desert, and up to six squads of Risen Guards are immediately dispatched to track them down when they slip off on their own to conduct field research.

			"For the vast majority of ships, the shackled sorcerer provides the main artillery in skirmishes, sending sheets of flame at enemy vessels or targeting burly, hostile sailors with blasts of arcane might from the rear of a boarding party. Most buccaneers give their sorcerers a wide berth, knowing their destructive power, and thus sorcerers sometimes find themselves ostracized from the rest of their crewmates, misunderstood by their less gifted and more superstitious compatriots. In battle, however, pirates do all they can to protect their magicwielding allies from harm, knowing that their powers can mean the difference between victory and swinging from a gibbet.",

Instead, they are considered advisers as well as weapons, and powers such as the ability to locate treasure or change the direction of the winds are highly prized among sea-faring magicwielders. While the bloodlines of shackled sorcerers are often connected in some way with life at sea-including the Aquatic or Stormborn bloodlines-any gifted arcane casters who can hurl destruction are welcomed aboard most ships."

			"Based in the Nidalese city of Nisroch, the Silent Enforcers maintain brutal order in the name of Zon-Kuthon and the city's Silent Shroud, the official security force that they're members of. Rather than recruiting from among Nisroch's populace, the enforcers of the Silent Shroud kidnap children from the city's lowest classes, whom they mold to fit their ideals. These children must endure a terrifying regimen of indoctrination and torture, and are rendered mute by the application of a hot poker to the throat. Those who survive emerge nameless and almost devoid of identity, their bodies hardened into living weapons that need neither armor with which to protect themselves nor implements with which to kill. Indoctrinated only to listen and react, to obey and not to think, a fully trained Silent Enforcer is a merciless and imposing agent of the Shrouded One-the mysterious leader of the Silent Shroud, and the only member to retain the ability to speak. The Shrouded One's identity is known only to Nisroch's top city officials, but even she is said to remain nameless, like her enforcers, identifying herself only with a series of hand gestures despite her ability to speak her own name should she wish to do so.",
			"",
			"Silent Enforcers primarily exercise authority over the peasants of Nisroch, but have jurisdiction over any criminal act committed in their sight. For the most part, the punishment for a crime the monks witness is up to each Silent Enforcer's own discretion, and they more often err on the side of the harsh and lethal variety. Should a Silent Enforcer catch a more notable citizen or an influential foreigner committing a crime, the perpetrator is expected to be apprehended rather than killed; it is acceptable for such criminals to turn up battered, so long as they're taken alive. Completely devoid of redeeming emotion, Silent Enforcers show mercy not to spare lives, but rather to subject their prisoners to the fearsome justice of Nidal. Most victims prefer a clean death in battle to the unimaginably sadistic tortures that would be exacted upon them should they be taken prisoner by an agent of the Silent Shroud.",
			"",
			"Typically, Silent Enforcers work in pairs or other multiples of two. Partners are assigned randomly each dawn, lest undue attachments form between agents that might compromise their duties. Should a Silent Enforcer be defeated, the lives of any peasants who bear witness to or spread tales of such an embarrassment are forfeit. Even nobles fear to speak of such occurrences, for the protections normally provided for those of their stature are ignored when the flawless reputation and intimidating legend of the Silent Shroud is at stake. Silent Enforcers treat the elimination of those attempting to escape their authority as a paramount duty, though their pursuit rarely extends beyond Nisroch's walls."

These warriors rarely rush into combat without some consideration and preparation. They prefer to cast preparatory spells such as shield of faith and weapon of awe if time permits. Their preferred method of combat is ambush; they use Stealth and attempt to approach their enemies undetected. The cannibals prefer to incapacitate their enemies using hold person or tanglefoot bags so they can tie up and eventually cook and eat their victims; a living prisoner spoils less quickly than a decaying corpse. If open combat becomes necessary, these zealots let the ferocious rage of the Three Feasters overtake them and don't back down until they or their enemies are dead.",

			"**Laser Pistol (Ex)** The gunslinger's laser pistol is a one-handed firearm that shoots a beam of highly focused light at its target, dealing 1d8 points of fire damage on a successful hit. The gun has a range increment of 50 feet, and its attacks resolve against the target's touch AC. Lasers can pass through force fields and force effects like a wall of force without damaging that field to strike a foe beyond. Objects like glass or other transparent barriers do not provide cover from lasers (but unlike force barriers, glass still takes damage from a laser strike passing through it). Invisible creatures are immune to damage caused by lasers. Fog, smoke, and other clouds provide cover in addition to concealment from laser attacks. Each shot expends 1 charge of the gun's 10-charge capacity. As a semiautomatic weapon, the gun fires one shot per attack. If the gunslinger wishes, he can fire an additional shot per round as if using the Rapid Shot feat. This additional shot can stack with the additional shot granted by Rapid Shot, but when it does so, it increases the penalty for all shots fired that round to -6. A laser pistol is worth 10,000 gp and weighs 2 pounds.",
			"",
			"**Numerian Silverdisks (Ex)** These small, coin-sized discs are etched with circuitry, and contain 10 charges each. When placed in a special slot in the gunslinger's laser pistol, a silverdisk transfers its charge into the gun's internal capacitors, effectively reloading the weapon. A silverdisk can be recharged (with a 20% chance of being destroyed) with an active generator. A charged silverdisk glows with light equivalent to that of a candle. A Numerian silverdisk is worth 100 gp as long as it is capable of holding a charge; a dead silverdisk is worth 1 gp.",
			"",
			"**Rare Resources (Ex)** The Numerian gunslinger's access to the rare and expensive technology of the land's many metal ruins increases his wealth to that of a PC of her level. This increases his CR by 1.",
			"",
			"Not content with the black powder guns of Alkenstar, the Numerian gunslinger tracks down and masters the high-tech weaponry of Numeria. In the course of his travels, he's made enemies among the Technic League, who, like the people of Alkenstar, want to ensure that their advanced technology doesn't spread beyond their reach. Other technological firearms can be found in Numeria beyond the laser pistol-see Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Technology Guide for more examples of advanced firearms such a character could use."

			"The members of Rahadoum's elite Pure Legion are among the most vigilant and skilled police force in the Inner Sea region, dedicated to the sole purpose of keeping that nation free of the influence of gods and those who worship them. In the wake of the Oath Wars, which tore northern Garund apart as the churches of Nethys, Norgorber, and Sarenrae fought for control of the region, the nation of Rahadoum was founded upon the belief that all religions were a pox upon the world and that the worship of any divine force could bring about nothing but ill fortune. To stay true to this belief, for the last 21 centuries the Pure Legionnaires have worked ceaselessly to keep priests, lay worshipers, and religious paraphernalia out of their land.",
			"",
			"Based in Azir, the birthplace of the Laws of Man and now known as Port Godless, the Pure Legion inspects all vessels coming into Rahadoum to ensure they contain no religious paraphernalia and convey no would-be proselytizers. Any religious iconography found within the nation is confiscated and destroyed, and those who profess the veneration of any deity are forbidden entry into the land; such residents are deported or worse, depending on the seriousness of their crime. Legionnaires are trained to see through deception, from mundane lies about a visitor's faith to illusions and magical misdirections, and often utilize trusted arcane spellcasters to verify that magical items brought into Rahadoum pose no divine threat to their strictly atheist society.",
			"",
			"Pure Legionnaires fill a variety of roles, from serving as ship inspectors and camel-riding desert caravan guards to city law enforcement and cult-hunters who infiltrate secret sects of illicit deity worshipers within the Rahadoumi population. Smugglers who are tempted to make a steep profit by transporting religious items into the nation often discover that the cost of challenging the Pure Legion is more than they're willing to pay, and much of the Pure Legion's work involves maintaining enough of a reputation to deter hidden priests and closet faithful from publicly violating their nation's most important law. While Pure Legionnaires aren't as bloodthirsty as other nations may portray them, all are zealously devoted to the cause."

Amid the mountains in the island's interior, however, lurk a great threat to this community: hill giants, ettins, and trolls, both in independent clans and under the sway of the hill giant war chief Gorgnak. Thus the half-orcs who call Averaka home have dedicated themselves to the eradication of their violent, monstrous neighbors. Some believe such channeling and focusing of their aggression represents the human side of the half-orcs winning out over the bloodthirsty instincts of their orc blood, though a few worry about where that aggression might be pointed next if they manage to defeat their giant enemies.",

When a warhorse dies, she buries its heart and head with honor and burns the rest, unwilling to let a noble companion be eaten by scavengers.

			"A cutthroat lawyer is a master of loopholes, doublespeak, intimidation, and litigation. She prides herself on doing whatever it takes-within the law-to win her case. Though this means she won't use illusions to falsify evidence or enchantments to alter a witness's memories or coerce a judge or juror to change a vote, it leaves her many opportunities to enhance her own ability to persuade and investigate. Given enough gold and access to the right potions, she destroys the opposition's arguments, eradicates the witnesses' credibility, discovers conflicts of interest in judges and jurors, digs up obscure laws that invalidate the charges of which her client is accused, suggests plausible conspiracies or mistaken identities, points fingers at other possible suspects, bogs down trial proceedings, and offers plea bargains to a trivially smaller sentence in order to get trials over with.",

She thrives on the attention and her ability to manipulate others to see things as she wants them to.

Any magic she uses to achieve a win is added to her bill, and her favorite clients are rich adventurers because they have the deepest pockets.",

She usually has the assistance of one or more less skilled lawyers (use the successful merchant stat block, expert 7) hoping to gain some prestige by association, and payrolls two or three investigator wizards (human diviner 4) at any one time. All of these agents are people she believes she can trust not to violate any laws in the pursuit of information, for one slip-up can invalidate her entire case and-worst of all-embarrass her professionally. An agent who shows a lack of discretion or discipline in this matter is cut off and disavowed; depending on the infraction, she might bring her litigious powers to bear against that person, in which case it is usually best for the target to flee the city, change his or her name, and attempt a new life somewhere else."

While many removed their masks and now do all they can to pursue a normal life, the most fanatical and psychologically scarred spread throughout Varisia, into some parts of Cheliax, and to more distant lands. Without a leader but knowing little else beyond service and violence, these remaining Gray Maidens seek new names and purposes in a world they no longer feel connected to. In Korvosa itself, Sabina Merrin (LN female human fighter 14)-the order's founder and Queen Ileosa's former consort-works to right the wrongs committed by the Gray Maidens, though many in the city are still understandably wary of her intentions. Elsewhere in Varisia, however, the former Gray Maiden Oriana (CN female human fighter 8) leads a devout group of fellow dishonored maidens who are unrepentant of their actions under Ileosa. Their whereabouts are currently unknown, but Oriana and those faithful to her are believed to be working toward retaking Korvosa in Queen Ileosa's honor, though what means they plan to use remain as shrouded as their scar-marked faces.

Vaeleus has gotten used to her lies and tricks eventually falling apart; she often has to leave town in a hurry when lovers or merchants realize they've been compelled against their will. For Vaeleus, it's a simple enough matter to just find a new town with new targets and new pleasures to experience. She doesn't waste time worrying about the bridges she's burned-after all, those people aren't worth anything to her now.",

			"**Combat Encounters:** During battle, Denarath sheepishly hovers behind the other combatants and gives her support with stoic detachment. After a battle, she searches the bodies for any maps, scrolls, or books that might be good sources of information. After that, she immediately pulls out a book and quill to write down an account of the high points of the battle.",
			"",
			"**Roleplaying Suggestions:** Denarath is extremely quiet and withdrawn. Her face betrays little emotion, and she speaks only in brief, concise sentences. Tending to take things too literally, she often scoffs at common figures of speech. She can be a hassle to travel with, since she packs a giant trunk of books for even the shortest journey. She reads late into the night, and refuses to leave until she's had time to pick up the tomes she's left scattered around."

			"Nothing more than a murderer for hire, Kresis will take nearly any job if the money is right. Possessing no loyalty to any one group, she rarely accepts jobs from the same people twice, and has been known to carry out assassinations for both sides of a single conflict.

If her employer hires another assassin, it's no longer her problem.",
			"",
			"**Combat Encounters:** Kresis does not kill for fun; she kills for pay. It's not her job to collect information, to help out other mercenaries, or to deliver messages-just to kill her target and get paid. She takes as few personal risks as possible, and makes sure she's prepared before a battle so she can fight on her own terms. Once a mercenary, she turned to assassination in order to have more control over her actions and lower her own risk of death, and she's not about to stick her neck out now. She almost never fights in the middle of the day, preferring to attack at night or near dusk or dawn when the shadows are long.",
			"",
			"**Roleplaying Suggestions:** Sullen and withdrawn, Kresis says little about herself, and seems distracted by her own thoughts. She is actually an attentive listener, though, and rarely forgets what she hears. She eavesdrops on tavern conversations to get information about her targets before the kill. She couldn't care less about the fallout after the hit-as long as she gets the money she was promised, she considers the venture a success."

She uses her magic to spy on townsfolk, punish her enemies and those who would thwart her plans, direct suspicion away from her onto a scapegoat, and sow confusion and panic among the townsfolk so she can manipulate them more easily.

The culmination of these acts almost certainly requires human sacrifice-whether a direct act with a knife or a subtle massacre such as a burning building-and perhaps a celestial conjunction between stars and planets invisible to the naked eye.",

His prejudice also makes it easier on those occasions when his missions or cover requires him to kill, as he tells himself with that killing humans and their ilk isn't really murder.

			"**Cold Flesh (Ex)** A winter witch gains endure elements as a constant, spell-like ability, but only against cold temperatures. At 4th level, she gains cold resistance 5, making her comfortable in near-freezing temperatures. This replaces the witch's 4th-level hex.",
			"",
			"**Freeze and Thaw (Su)** At 2nd level, a winter witch can freeze water or melt ice and snow with a touch. As a standard action, a winter witch can melt an adjacent 5-foot cube of ice or 10-foot cube of snow. Melting snow produces a volume of water equal to 10% the snow's volume. Alternatively, a winter witch can freeze 5 cubic feet of water into solid ice. This freezing takes place gradually over 1 round, making it almost impossible to trap a creature unless it's helpless. This ability cannot affect water within a creature. One cubic foot of ice contains roughly 8 gallons of water and weighs about 60 pounds. This ability works on fresh water and saltwater, but has no affect on water creatures; on liquids (frozen or otherwise) other than water; or on magical water, ice, or snow. A winter witch can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 1/2 her class level.",
			"",
			"**Hyperboreal Patronage** A winter witch's patron reveals an icy aspect. A winter witch adds the following spells to her spell list at the following class levels, but does not automatically learn them: 3rd-wall of ice, 5th-icy prison, 7th-freezing sphere.",
			"",
			"**Ice Magic** When a winter witch casts a spell with the cold descriptor, the save DC of the spell increases by 1. A winter witch cannot learn or cast spells with the fire descriptor.",
			"",
			"**Sculpt Ice and Snow (Sp)** At 4th level, a winter witch can sculpt ice and snow into any shape that suits her purpose (as stone shape, except that it works with ice). This ability also works on snow, doubling the volume affected. At 7th level, this ability functions on ice or snow like the fabricate spell, increasing the volume manipulated and allowing a higher degree of craftsmanship. The winter witch must succeed at appropriate Craft checks to form complex items or ones with fine detail. Items created by the fabricate version of this ability solidify into ultra-hard ice (hardness 5, 10 hit points per inch of thickness) that resists normal melting but takes double damage from fire. The ice remains in this ultra-hard state for 1 hour per class level before returning to normal ice. A winter witch can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 1/2 her class level.",
			"",
			"**Unnatural Cold (Su)** At 3rd level, whenever a winter witch's spell, spell-like ability, or supernatural ability deals cold damage, treat affected creatures as having half their normal cold resistance when determining damage dealt.",
			"",
			"**Winter Witchcraft** Levels of the winter witch prestige class stack with witch levels for determining when the winter witch learns new hexes, the effect of her hexes and other witch class abilities (including archetype abilities), the abilities of her witch's familiar, and the level at which she can select major hexes or grand hexes.",
			"",
			"Nearly all of the White Witches ruling Irrisen are winter witches. This one represents a Cold Sister, a member of an organization devoted to hunting down anyone disloyal to the throne of Irrisen. Those the Cold Sisters find, they torture into compliance and devotion, or execute for their crimes against the queen."

Though the future is uncertain for any orc amid the chaos and bloodshed of battle, it's even more treacherous for those who bear their tribes' banners and are marked with the ceremonial symbols of a warchief, for they must ever watch for challengers to their authority-both outside enemies and ambitious members of their own tribe."

			"**Shade of the Uskwood** The Uskwood druid adds the following spells to his druid spell list: 0-disrupt undead, ray of frost; 1st-ghost sound, touch of fatigue; 2nd-chill touch, spectral hand; 3rd-ghoul touch, invisibility; 4th- displacement, ray of exhaustion; 5th-animate dead, phantasmal killer; 6th-nightmare, waves of fatigue; 7th-circle of death, shadow walk; 8th-mass invisibility, waves of exhaustion; 9th-horrid wilting, weird. His spell list doesn't include spells with the fire descriptor, he can't use spells with the fire descriptor from magic items, and he can't use wild shape to take the form of a creature with the fire subtype. The druid's Umbrae-Token ties his soul to the foul power of the Uskwood; if it's ever destroyed, he loses all benefits of this feat.",
			"",
			"Inside the shadowed, silent reaches of the Uskwood Forest in Nidal, albino druids watch for intruders and enforce the natural order as they see it. These \"pale ones,\" as those who live near the Uskwood all them, serve the majesty of the Midnight Lord, Zon-Kuthon. Sworn and bonded to the Uskwood's bleak power, they celebrate the inevitable pain and death inherent to the natural order. To live is to know suffering, and the druids of the Uskwood ensure that any intruders in their forest know the full measure of pain.",
			"",
			"Like many of the evil creatures of Nidal, the Uskwood druids come out after dusk, patrolling above and below the canopies. Because the forest is unnaturally dark, they often transform into animal forms that have darkvision so that they can watch over their home in the darkest hours of night. Under the fragile moonlight that manages to penetrate the Uskwood, the druids' white skin shines like a beacon. They have no need for stealth on their patrols-their confidence as masters of the wood is absolute. Travelers who want to pass through the Uskwood can take their chances during the day, but to survive the crossing, they must hide themselves carefully once the sun sets, remaining as silent and concealed as possible throughout the night.",
			"",
			"During the day, the druids meet secretly to share resources, initiate new members, and plan for the betterment of the forest. Though they all serve Zon- Kuthon and the Uskwood, the druids clash with each other regularly, especially when they catch sight of one another during their nightly patrols, becoming wild whenever one trespasses into another's territory. Zon- Kuthon is, after all, the god of envy, and they believe it pleases him when they battle to claim what they can from one another. The druids wild shape into albino animal forms for their primordial battles, screaming and roaring as they crash through the underbrush and spill one another's blood in unholy ritual combat. An Uskwood druid who wins such a battle captures and shackles the animal companion of his slain rival, keeping the creature alive for as long as possible but never freeing it or giving it any release from its suffering. By doing this, the victorious Uskwood druid can relive his triumph and savor over and over the defeat of his enemy, as the druids see that the connection between a slain druid and his orphaned animal companion is not entirely diminished when one dies; indeed, there remains a sliver of the bond between the two creatures' souls. Despite this belief, it is not uncommon for Uskwood druids to sacrifice their own animal companions in somber rituals to the Midnight Lord, so that their own souls may suffer the pain of their bonded animals.",
			"",
			"Umbrae-Tokens, grotesque effigies of hair, twigs, and clotted blood, symbolize Uskwood druids' connection to the forest and their faith in Zon-Kuthon. The druids accept only albinos into their ranks (of any race, but most frequently humans, elves, and half-elves). Whether a potential initiate is already a druid or wishes to become one, he must gather the raw materials for his Umbrae-Token from different areas of the Uskwood without using any spells to procure them. This is a long, arduous process, and the suffering the initiate undergoes is absolutely the most essential part of it. This metaphysical link grants the druid some powers over necromancy and undeath, and forbids him from making use of flames that might set the forest ablaze. Even the light that fire brings to the forest is blasphemy to an Uskwood druid, and kindling a campfire within its reaches invites certain death.",
			"",
			"### Dire Bat Companion",
			"",
			"This Uskwood druid's animal companion is an immense, coal-black dire bat that sometimes carries the druid as a rider to scout stretches of the Uskwood from the air. The creature is carnivorous and vicious, and the druid has taught it to leave the gore on its body after it fights or feasts.",
			"",
			"This dire bat resembles most predators of the Uskwood: cruel, feral, and unnerving. There's no clear division between predator and prey in the forest. Even the smallest creatures, such as centipedes, insects, and arachnids, tend to be venomous, and the largest predators might be brought down by a group of other vicious beasts. Only the Uskwood druids and their magic can control these monsters. The albinos torture and retrain potential animal companions until they're broken in rather than attempting to entice them into service or befriending them.",

He commands his soldiers from horseback, and those who know of him joke that he leaves his horse only to drink, sleep, and relieve himself-and maybe not always then. When they talk about his combat prowess, or when the dwarf himself is near, the joking ends, for he is a juggernaut of metal and divine fury, stern-faced and unforgiving in the face of evil and injustice. Kelgul uses few words, even for a dwarf. When in combat, though, he barks orders and expects them to be followed, even by those not under his direct command.",

			"Growing up in a rough neighborhood, Lylin had to learn at a young age to fight fast and dirty. Her grace and feisty nature caught the attention of a traveling swordmaster and assassin, who took in the halfling as a student and raised her as a daughter. He cultivated her kill-or-be-killed nature, and trained her to be fearless and utterly ruthless in both battle and life. Her former master is long dead, but she has taken his lessons to heart, becoming a bold and competent killer. These days she's something of a loner, but still keeps an eye out for promising young halflings similar to herself as a child, so that she might pass on her advice and training. Though much of her knowledge is loudly proclaimed to be a \"trade secret,\" she has often been known to boast of its central maxim: \"Hit first, hit hard, and don't stop till you're painted red.\"",

Though an assassin and mercenary by trade-one who might easily be hired by any villain and sent against the PCs-Lylin disdains anonymity, and would prefer to finish her kills in public (though she isn't averse to starting with a sneak attack from the shadows).",
			"",
			"**Roleplaying Suggestions:** Lylin's master taught her social graces, but even when diplomatic and pleasant, she is always sizing up potential opponents, and feels no qualms about taking life at the slightest provocation. She is far more likely to ally with a party that contains other halflings, though those who rely too much on racial camaraderie may be surprised by how quickly her backslapping friendship disappears if they dare question her methods."

			"### Special Abilities",
			"",
			"**Arcane Architect (Ex)** The Arclord of Nex can create constructs with the Craft Construct feat in only half the time it would normally take. In addition, she can apply the Extend Spell and/or Widen Spell metamagic feats to conjuration (creation) spells she prepares, even if she doesn't possess those feats. If she does possess them, the level increase for applying Extend Spell to a conjuration (creation) spell is eliminated, and the level increase for applying Widen Spell to a conjuration (creation) spell is reduced to 2.",
			"",
			"**Artificer's Touch (Sp)** The Arclord of Nex can expend one use of her hand of the apprentice ability to use the Artifice domain's artificer's touch power as a 15th-level cleric.",
			"",
			"**Improved Third Eye (Su)** Four times per day as a move action, the Arclord of Nex can open an incandescent third eye upon her forehead for 1 minute, during which time she casts all divination spells at +1 caster level, gains darkvision 60 feet, and can use detect magic at will. While the eye is open, she also gains a +8 bonus on Perception checks to notice invisible creatures and can use the aid another action to grant an adjacent wizard a +1 bonus to his caster level and a +2 circumstance bonus on concentration checks for the next wizard spell he casts before the beginning of the Arclord's next turn. If the Arclord expends two uses of her hand of the apprentice ability, she can add the effect of arcane sight or see invisibility to the benefits of her third eye for 1 minute (or until the duration of the third eye ends, whichever is sooner). She can add both effects by spending four uses of hand of the apprentice.",
			"",
			"**Mystic Pedagogue (Ex)** The Arclord of Nex adds a bonus equal to 1/2 her class level on Spellcraft checks to learn a wizard spell or craft a magical item.",
			"",
			"**Scholiast (Sp)** The Arclord of Nex can use the protective ward abjuration school ability as a 15th-level wizard by expending two uses of her hand of the apprentice ability.",
			"",
			"Claiming to be descended from the wizard Nex's household servants, the Arclords see it as their solemn duty to further the archmage's goals in his absence. Over time, the exact details of these goals have evolved as Arclords have uncovered and analyzed additional texts penned by Nex, though more often than not they jealously guard these documents, making it difficult for outsiders to determine whether members of the secretive society of mages are staying true to their cause or subtly manipulating their findings for their own inscrutable purposes.",
			"",
			"Among the most famous techniques of the Arclords is their ability to open a third eye upon the forehead. Intense willpower is required to keep this eye open. Few can maintain the eye for more than a few minutes, yet in that time even a basic practitioner can sense the presence and flow of magic as no other. Especially talented Arclords can analyze enchantments almost instantly and even see through the most convincing illusions while benefiting from this magical sight.",
			"",
			"Although divinations give the Arclords an edge, the tool that most makes them a force to be reckoned with is their magical constructs. Oenopion in particular specializes in the construction of golems, and the Arclords from this Nexian city are among the most capable eldritch smiths, even among their counterparts from other parts of Nex. An Arclord is rarely without at least one construct bodyguard or assistant, and even a lone Arclord often has the means to instantly summon one or more golems to her side at the slightest sign of a threat.",
			"",
			"The highest concentration of Arclords in the Inner Sea is in Nex, where the organization reigned supreme for several centuries during the Age of Enthronement. Their decision to resume hostilities with Geb eventually led to their exile to the island of Jalmeray, and though the Arclords ruled there for several more centuries, the rajahs of Vudra destroyed all but a handful of the stubborn mages with an army of genies, angry at the Arclords' trespassing. The only other land the Arclords made a concerted effort to insinuate themselves into, following their exodus from Jalmeray, was Absalom, where they established the famous Arcanamirium, a school of magic. The Arclords launched a failed campaign to conquer the island metropolis using the school as their base of power, and relics of their assault likely still lie buried among the siege fortresses outside of Absalom.",
			"",
			"Perhaps in response to their failures in executing large, sweeping changes, most Arclords now pursue a more subtle agenda of integrating arcane magic directly into the cities and cultures of the Inner Sea, thus building a growing dependence upon their services, research, and insights. As a result, they consider courtly skills of diplomacy, etiquette, and composure second in importance only to their magical studies; these earn them influence they could never maintain through direct force.",
			"",
			"Even so, the Arclords crave the influence and power to accomplish several key goals. First, they long to regain their control over the Nex, and thereby gain uncontested access to its resources instead of having to negotiate with the Council of Three and Nine. With such means at their disposal, they might finally eradicate the country of Geb and its namesake necromancer-a task they are certain Nex himself would appreciate. Finally, the Arclords publicly express an interest in finding the wizard Nex and restoring him to power. This claim is bandied about only to reinforce the Arclords' political mandate and power, however, as doing so would certainly rob the Arclords of their autonomy, among other unforeseeable consequences."

			"In the Realm of the Mammoth Lords, strength is the key to survival, and there's no greater symbol of that strength than a powerful Kellid warrior astride one of the massive beasts that roam those untamed lands. Though these warrior's massive mounts are not always mammoths, the rest of the Inner Sea region has long been captivated by this romantic (and terrifying) image, leading to the name of the Mammoth Lords and their followers.",
			"",
			"Mammoth riders are fierce hunters and defenders of the lands they call home. Whether part of a \"following\"-a loose affiliation of individual Kellid families and tribes united under a powerful leader-or loners traveling the wilds with only their gigantic steeds for company, mammoth riders are as much forces of nature as the winds that blast across the Ginji Mesa.",
			"",
			"While it might be hard for citizens of southern nations to imagine who in their right minds would challenge a man or woman atop thousands of pounds of fur and tusk, mammoth riders do in fact face numerous foes, ranging from other dangerous megafauna to the giant tribes of the Tusk and Kodar Mountains to demonic forces from the Worldwound to the east. Orcs from Belkzen to the south are also a problem, as the warring tribes also see the value in using megafauna as terrible weapons in battle, and they frequently lead raiding parties into mammoth warrior lands in order to capture the giant creatures. Along the southern borders of their land, most mammoth warriors have a particular hatred for Belkzen invaders, as the orcs' use of mammoths and other megafauna as engines of war tends to be crude, wasteful, and unnecessarily cruel to the animals, creating a dark parody of the mammoth riders themselves.",
			"",
			"Along these same lines, mammoths are more than just beasts of burden for their riders. The ability to acquire and train a mammoth is far from universal, and many riders come to value their mounts as friends or even totem animals. A mammoth is a symbol of its rider's strength of will and prowess in battle, and as such it's common for riders to decorate their mounts with dyes and warpaint that matches their own, or to pierce or wrap their tusks with rings of metal. Some tribes even engage in elaborate scrimshaw, carving the life stories of each creature's riders into its tusks.",
			"",
			"Mammoth riders can be powerful allies in the rugged lands just south of the Crown of the World. Their survival skills, strength in battle, and strong connection to nature spirits allow them to protect themselves and others against the dangers of the wild. But these same abilities can make them dangerous enemies, and they grow even more dangerous if other tribes add their strength to that of a powerful and respected leader. Further, most mammoth riders are suspicious of outsiders and deeply superstitious about magic, especially when the latter comes from arcane sources. Travelers making their way through the Realm of the Mammoth Lords are wise to enlist local guides to help them placate local rulers and negotiate taboos, lest they find themselves in the path of a stampeding beast or the set spear of a charging rider."

When his clan's mines dug too deep into the Darklands, he was forced to defend his family mines against duergar and drow incursions, working with shielded defenders to lunge out from protective shield walls, using his mobility to take down dangerous foes before moving back behind the moveable walls of iron and dwarven muscle. His unorthodox tactics were mocked at first, with some seeing him as cowardly for not standing and fighting with feet planted like a normal dwarven warrior, but as the corpses of the clan's enemies mounted into piles, then great mounds, the whispers and jokes died. Now he enjoys high status within his clan, and teaches his ways to a new generation of dwarves, occasionally making pilgrimages out onto the surface to take his tactics to other holds.",

While he learned much, killing could not restore his pride or his faith in his people, nor slake the rage in his heart. Since taking his leave from his companions, he has roamed the world in search of purpose. He fights now for the fun of it, and his temper has gradually cooled to dark embers. Still, he might join any nearby fray on any side. Should anyone land a blow he notices, he might begin to fight in earnest.",
