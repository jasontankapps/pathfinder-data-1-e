Whether a bar brawl with the goal of rousing the local populace to rise up against a band of bullies or a sun-drenched and bloody gladiatorial contest where life and death actually hinge on the favor of the crowd, performance combats are fights in which showmanship and flair can be more important than ruthless fighting efficiency.",

			"When creating a performance combat, it is important to determine the goals and rules of that combat. The following are the major examples of performance combat, but you should feel free to mix and match some of these general categories to create a performance combat that fits the story of your campaign.",
			"",
			"**Knockout Bout:** Frequently as brutal but not as bloody as battles to the death, a knockout bout does not end in the death of one side, but still requires a clear and crushing victory. As long as both sides in the performance combat remain standing, the fight continues. Many knockout bout combats require that their participants deal nonlethal damage.",
			"",
			"**Staged Combats:** Staged combats are less dangerous than knockout bouts. In these contests, combatants typically arrange to have blows that just barely land, so the hits are not registered as either nonlethal or lethal damage, but crowd reaction is determined in the same way as for normal battles. Staged combats often require advanced training (see the [Stage Combatant](feat/stage_combatant) feat). Those without advanced training can attempt to participate, but take a -6 penalty on attack rolls in order to make it seem like their attacks hit without doing real damage.",
			"",
			"**To a Number of Wounds:** Not all blood sports end in death. It is often costly to train warriors for arenas big and small, and those who finance such enterprises are protective of their investments. In societies that value life but still love the spectacle of a good fracas, fighting to a number of wounds is an excellent compromise. A fight to first blood or to a certain number of wounds is often enough to appease a crowd.",
			"",
			"**To the Death:** Only the death of one side ends these bouts. Sometimes the crowd's reaction is secondary to the desperate battle on display, but other times the crowd's reaction can have an effect on the actual outcome of the fight. Some blood sports demand that combatants hold off on the killing blow until the crowd gets a chance to voice its pleasure or displeasure, usually with a roar of applause or with a thumbs-up or thumbs-down gesture. A thumbs-up gesture allows the vanquished combatant to live and fight another day; a thumbs-down gesture ends the melee with a grotesque spray of blood.",
			"",
			"**Toward a Goal:** Often these are elaborate affairs that may reproduce a historical battle, or just pit combatants against terrain and challenges that feature a variety of hazards and traps. These types of battles can be races (maybe mixing them with [the rules for vehicular combat](rule/vehicles_in_combat)), or may present capture-the-flag-like objectives, but all test the ability of the combatants to achieve a predetermined goal."

			"",
			"A crowd's attitude is similar to a nonplayer character's attitude when a character uses the Diplomacy skill. The DC of performance combat checks to improve crowd reaction is tied to the crowd's starting or current attitude. Each time the combatants do something spectacular on the battlefield, they have the opportunity to parlay that success into a better crowd reaction, but missteps can also create contempt among the crowd.",
			"",
			"During performance combat, it is important for the GM to keep track of the crowd's attitude toward each side of the combat. Given that a crowd is filled with many people shouting, clapping, booing, hissing, or otherwise showing their pleasure or displeasure, the exact crowd reaction changes from moment to moment based on events on the battlefield, but groups of combatants always have a reasonable idea of what the crowd thinks of their performance at any given time.",
			"",

This is a mind-affecting effect.",
			"",

This can be important for the story of the game, or if the PCs are participating in serialized performance combats.",
			"",
			"**Unfriendly:** While still biased against a side, the crowd reserves its most vocal disdain for failed performance combat checks. Unfriendly crowds demoralize combatants in a performance combat. In these battles, while the crowd is unfriendly toward a given side, those combatants take a -1 penalty on all attack rolls, combat maneuver checks, ability checks, skill checks, and saving throws. This is a mind-affecting effect.",
			"",
			"**Indifferent:** The crowd is waiting for something exciting to happen. Audience members show little emotion other than anticipation and a desire for daring feats of combat to occur.",
			"",
			"**Friendly:** The crowd is beginning to be swayed toward one side in the fray. Audience members cheer when that side achieves some impressive feat in the combat, and their reaction grants a +1 morale bonus on all attack rolls, combat maneuver checks, ability checks, skill checks, and saving throws for their chosen side. This is a mind-affecting effect.",
			"",
			"**Helpful:** The crowd loves what it is seeing from a given side. Audience members stand up, chant, cheer, and scream for the combatants to push on toward ultimate success. A helpful crowd grants its chosen champions a +2 morale bonus on all attack rolls, combat maneuver checks, ability checks, skill checks, and saving throws. This is a mind-affecting effect.",

Favored champions of a fighting pit or a city may start at a higher attitude step, while outsiders, prisoners of war, or criminals may start at a lower attitude step. If you are running a series of combats, a crowd may start with a higher or lower starting attitude based on a combatant's or a group of combatants' performance in the last bout, which is determined by the number of victory points the individual or group has (see the Serialized Performance Combats section)."

			"",
			"All siege engines are at least size Large devices and often much larger. Unless stated otherwise in an individual siege engine description, all siege engines use the following rules.",
			"",
			"**Proficiency:** Siege engines are exotic weapons. A creature with the [Siege Engineer](feat/siege_engineer) feat is proficient with all siege engines, including siege firearms. A creature that is proficient in firearms is also proficient in siege firearms, but not other siege engines.",
			"",
			"**Crew:** The sheer size of a siege engine often necessitates a crew for its use. One person of that crew is the crew leader. Usually the crew leader targets or controls the movement of a siege engine; sometimes the crew leader does both. Often the crew leader is required to take actions and make specific checks in order for a siege engine to function. The rest of the crew members are required to spend actions and make checks in order for a siege engine to function.",
			"",
			"The number of members in a crew assumes Medium creatures. A ram can be crewed by Small creatures, but it takes double the crew to do the same job. If Large or larger creatures serve as crew members, each Large creature counts as four crew members, a Huge creature counts as eight Medium creatures, a Gargantuan creature counts as 16 Medium creatures, and a Colossal creature counts as 20 Medium creatures.",
			"",
			"**Magical and Masterwork Siege Engines:** Siege engines can be masterwork, increasing their Craft DC by 5 and costing an additional 300 gp. A masterwork siege engine can be enchanted at twice the cost for a normal magical weapon. The enhancement bonus of a siege engine applies on attack rolls and targeting checks (in the case of indirect ranged siege engines), and in the case of magical siege engines, the enhancement bonus also applies on damage rolls.",
			"",
			"**Defense and Hit Points:** All siege engines are objects. A siege engine has a Dexterity of 0 (-5 penalty) and a further penalty based on its size. Each type of siege engine has its own hardness and hit points. Siege engines can be armored-treat the siege engine as a creature of its size to determine the cost of the armor. Masterwork siege engine armor can be enchanted for twice the normal cost to enchant armor. Armored siege engines have an armor bonus equal to that normally granted by the specific armor (shields have no effect on a siege engine), a hardness and hit points equal to that of the armor, and bonus hit points equal to the armor bonus &times; 5.",
			"",
			"**Moving Siege Engines:** Siege engines have a speed. The speed of a siege engine is the distance it can be moved if its full crew makes a move action to move it. Some siege engines have a speed of 0. If this is the case, the engine must be dissembled before movement is possible, or else mounted on a vehicle. Siege engines that are atop or mounted on vehicles move with those vehicles.",
			"",
			"**Ranged Attacks:** Unlike normal ranged weapons, siege engines do not deal half damage when attacking objects.",
			"",
			"**Critical Hits:** When a direct-fire siege engine or a close assault siege engine scores a critical hit, it confirms the critical and deals critical hit damage just like any other weapon. If an indirect-fire ranged siege engine rolls a natural 20 on its targeting check, it can also score a critical hit. The crew leader must reroll the targeting check to confirm the critical. If the confirmation targeting check is successful, the attack is a critical hit, and the siege engine multiplies its damage by its critical multiplier. Unlike normal attacks, siege engines attacks can deal critical hit damage to objects. Siege engines do not gain the benefit of critical feats the crew or the crew leader may have.",
			"",
			"**Mishaps and Misfires:** Rolling a natural 1 on an attack roll or a targeting check made by an indirect-fire ranged siege engine produces a mishap. Usually a mishap applies the broken condition. A non-firearm siege engine with the broken condition takes a -2 penalty on attack rolls, targeting checks, and damage rolls. It also moves at half its normal speed.",
			"",
			"If the creature that serves as crew leader has the Siege Engineer feat, that creature does not generate a mishap on a natural 1 when firing the siege engine.",
			"",
			"Firearm siege weapons do not gain a mishap on a natural 1, but instead have a misfire value, like other firearms do. An attack roll or targeting check that falls within the misfire range causes the firearm siege engine to misfire. A misfire always misses, and applies the broken condition to the siege engine firearm. A firearm siege weapon with the broken condition takes all of the penalties and limitations that non-firearm siege engines do, and the misfire range of the firearm siege engine is increased by 4. If the firearm siege engine already has the broken condition when it misfires, it explodes. When a firearm siege engine explodes, it deals its damage to all creatures within a blast range (those within the blast can attempt a DC 20 Reflex save for half damage). The normal misfire range of a firearm siege engine and its blast range are given in the individual firearm siege engine description. Crew leaders with the [Siege Engineer](feat/siege_engineer) feat do not lower the misfire value of firearm siege engines.",
			"",
			"**Constructing and Repairing Siege Engines:** A siege engine is a complex device requiring a DC 20 Craft (siege engine) skill check to build or repair.",
			"",
			"**Disabling Siege Engines:** A siege engine is considered a difficult device to disable, requiring 2d4 rounds of effort and a DC 20 Disable Device check to do so. When a siege engine is disabled, it either doesn't work or is sabotaged and stops working 1d4 minutes after use. Fixing a disabled siege engine requires a DC 20 Craft (siege engine), Disable Device, or Knowledge (engineering) check. It takes 10 minutes to fix the device, and the check can be retried if the fix fails.",
			"",
			"**Assembling Siege Engines:** Siege engines are broken down for transport and can be reassembled on the battlefield, requiring the time and number of workers noted below. Each assembly worker must make a DC 10 Craft (siege engine) check; if untrained, they may not take 10. Assembly can be performed with at least half the required number of workers by doubling the time required. If fewer than half are available, the weapon cannot be assembled.",

In those cases, the type of energy damage is listed instead.",

Loading ammunition takes a number of full-round actions depending on the siege engine (this time can be reduced to move actions if the crew leader has the [Master Siege Engineer](feat/master_siege_engineer) feat).",
			"",
			"**Aiming a Siege Engine:** Ranged siege engines must be aimed in order to attack a desired target (in the case of direct-fire siege engines) or square (in the case of indirect-fire siege engines). Aiming takes a number of full-round actions (or move actions if the crew leader has the [Master Siege Engineer](feat/master_siege_engineer) feat), with the number depending on the specific siege engine. Aiming a siege engine with a diminished crew doubles the amount of time it takes to aim the siege engine. Each time a new target or square is chosen as the target of a siege engine's attack, that engine must be aimed anew.",
			"",
			"**Direct-Fire Ranged Siege Engines:** Direct-fire weapons launch their projectiles on a relatively flat trajectory, allowing them to more easily target creatures or pummel barriers directly in front of them.",
			"",
			"A direct-fire weapon uses a normal attack roll, with the normal penalty for nonproficient use. In addition, a direct-fire weapon takes a -2 attack roll penalty per size category that the weapon is larger than the creature aiming it. Creatures that have ranks in Knowledge (engineering) are not adversely affected by their size when firing direct-fire ranged siege engines.",
			"",
			"Sheer manpower can also reduce the penalties for size. Increasing the crew of these weapons by 1 or more can reduce the attack roll penalty for creature size: as long as an extra crew member is no smaller than three size categories smaller than the direct-fire weapon, it can reduce the penalty due to the aiming creature's size by 2. For example, a Huge ballista fired by a Medium creature that is part of a crew of two (the creature aiming the ballista and someone to help position it) takes only a -2 penalty on attack rolls.",
			"",
			"**Indirect-Fire Ranged Siege Engines:** Indirect-fire weapons launch projectiles in high arcs toward their targets. They typically lob heavier missiles and payloads than direct-fire weapons, but they are harder to aim accurately. Indirect weapons can bypass many forms of fortification, delivering their payloads of solid shot, scatter shot, or even disease-ridden offal to targets beyond the walls of castles. They can also be used to batter fortifications where they are most vulnerable, arcing down on towers and walls, crushing them with the weight of stone or raining down smaller projectiles on a wall's defenders.",
			"",
			"Indirect-fire weapons use a targeting mechanic similar to that described for catapults in the Core Rulebook, hereafter referred to as an indirect attack. The following is an update to those rules.",
			"",
			"**Indirect Attack:** To fire an indirect-fire ranged siege engine, the crew leader makes a targeting check against the DC of the siege engine. This check uses his base attack bonus, his Intelligence modifier (if not trained in Knowledge [engineering]) or Knowledge (engineering) skill modifier (if trained in that skill), any penalty for not being proficient in the siege engine, and the appropriate modifiers from Table 3-12. If the check succeeds, the ammunition of the indirect attack hits the square the siege engine was aimed at, dealing the indicated damage or effect to any object or creature within the area of its attack. Creatures may get a saving throw to limit the effect of the attack; this is typically based on the type of ammunition used.",
			"",
			"If the attack misses the intended square, roll 1d8 to determine in what direction the shot veers. A roll of 1 indicates the ammunition falls short (toward the siege engine), with rolls of 2 through 8 counting squares clockwise around the target square. Roll 1d4 for every range increment at which the attack was made (1d4 if the target square is within the engine's first range increment, 2d4 if the target square is within the second range increment, and so on). The total is the number of squares by which the attack misses, with the direction in which the squares are counted determined by the d8 roll.

The wizard does not have to slumber for every minute of the time, but he must refrain from movement, combat, spellcasting, skill use, conversation, or any other fairly demanding physical or mental task during the rest period. If his rest is interrupted, each interruption adds 1 hour to the total amount of time he has to rest in order to clear his mind, and he must have at least 1 hour of uninterrupted rest immediately prior to preparing his spells. If the character does not need to sleep for some reason, he still must have 8 hours of restful calm before preparing any spells.",

He cannot, however, abandon a previously prepared spell to replace it with another one or fill a slot that is empty because he has cast a spell in the meantime. That sort of preparation requires a mind fresh from rest. Like the first session of the day, this preparation takes at least 15 minutes, and it takes longer if the wizard prepares more than one-quarter of his spells.",

To prepare a divine spell, a character must have a Wisdom score (or Charisma score for paladins) of 10 + the spell's level. Likewise, bonus spells are based on Wisdom.",

			"**Time of Day:** A divine spellcaster chooses and prepares spells ahead of time, but unlike a wizard, does not require a period of rest to prepare spells. Instead, the character chooses a particular time of day to pray and receive spells. The time is usually associated with some daily event. If some event prevents a character from praying at the proper time, she must do so as soon as possible. If the character does not stop to pray for spells at the first opportunity, she must wait until the next day to prepare spells.",

The time required to prepare spells is the same as it is for a wizard (1 hour), as is the requirement for a relatively peaceful environment. When preparing spells for the day, a divine spellcaster can leave some of her spell slots open. Later during that day, she can repeat the preparation process as often as she likes. During these extra sessions of preparation, she can fill these unused spell slots. She cannot, however, abandon a previously prepared spell to replace it with another one or fill a slot that is empty because she has cast a spell in the meantime. Like the first session of the day, this preparation takes at least 15 minutes, and it takes longer if she prepares more than one-quarter of her spells.",

Each domain gives her access to a number of special abilities and bonus spells.",
			"",
			"**Spell Slots:** The character class tables show how many spells of each level each can cast per day. These openings for daily spells are called spell slots. A spellcaster always has the option to fill a higher-level spell slot with a lowerlevel spell.

Therefore, psychic spells never have verbal or somatic components, and have only expensive material components. Psychic spells are purely mental actions, and they can be cast even while the caster is pinned or paralyzed. Focus components work the same way with psychic spells as they do with other spells.",
			"",
			"When a spell calls for an expensive material component, a psychic spellcaster can instead use any item with both significant meaning and a value greater than or equal to the spell's component cost. For example, if a spiritualist wanted to cast [raise dead](spell/raise_dead) to bring her dead husband back from the grave, she could use her 5,000 gp wedding ring as the spell's material component.",
			"",
			"Instead of verbal and somatic components, all psychic spells have components related to the caster's inner being. The two psychic components are called emotion components and thought components. If a spell's components line lists a somatic component, that spell instead requires an emotion component when cast by psychic spellcasters, and if it has a verbal component, it instead requires a thought component when cast by psychic spellcasters. Psychic spells cast by non-psychic arcane and divine casters use any listed somatic and verbal components as normal.",
			"",
			"**Emotion Components:** Emotion components represent a particular emotional state required to cast the spell. A psychic spellcaster marshals her desire in order to focus and release the spell's energy. It is impossible to cast a spell with an emotion component while the spellcaster is under the influence of a non-harmless effect with the emotion or fear descriptors. Even if the effect's emotion matches the necessary emotion to cast the psychic spell, the spellcaster is not in control of her own desires and animal impulses, which is a necessary part of providing an emotion component.",
			"",
			"**Thought Components:** Thought components represent mental constructs necessary for the spell's function, such as picturing a wolf in vivid detail-down to the saliva dripping from its jaws-in order to cast [beast shape](spell/beast_shape_1) to transform into a wolf. Thought components are so mentally demanding that they make interruptions and distractions extremely challenging. The DC for any concentration check for a spell with a thought component increases by 10. A psychic spellcaster casting a spell with a thought component can take a move action before beginning to cast the spell to center herself; she can then use the normal DC instead of the increased DC.",
			"",
			"Just as spell-like abilities never require verbal, somatic, or material components, these abilities also don't require thought or emotion components. A psychic spellcaster can replace verbal and somatic components with thought and emotion components only for the purposes of the spell components themselves, not for the purposes of any other rules elements that relate to verbal and somatic components. She can't use [Silent Spell](feat/silent_spell) to ignore the thought component of a spell, for example. The new feats [Intuitive Spell](feat/intuitive_spell) and [Logical Spell](feat/logical_spell) serve a similar function for these new components."

When a spellcaster undercasts a spell, it is treated exactly like the lower-level version, including when determining its effect, saving throw, and other variables. For example, a psychic spellcaster who adds [ego whip III](spell/ego_whip_3) to his list of spells known can cast it as [ego whip I](spell/ego_whip_1), [II](spell/ii), or [III](spell/iii). If he casts it as [ego whip I](spell/ego_whip_1), it is treated in all ways as that spell; it uses the text and the saving throw DC for that spell, and requires him to expend a 3rd-level spell slot.",

A creature under this affect can only make itself heard by others by spending a swift action to focus its will on speech. Casting spells with a verbal component has a 20% chance of spell failure, and the save DCs of any spells she casts with the language-dependent descriptor are reduced by 4.

Further failed saving throws increase the penalty by 1 until the character reaches a -4 penalty, at which point she becomes blinded instead.",

			"**Nameless Dread:** A caster with nameless dread believes strange beings from far dimensions or the blackness between the stars are hounding her and sapping her sanity. Every time the caster uses a spell or a spell-like ability, she sees a glimpse of her nameless pursuers. She must succeed at a concentration check (DC 15 + twice the spell's level), or become shaken for 1 round per level of the spell. If already shaken, the spellcaster becomes frightened for the duration of the original effect or the duration of the new effect, whichever is greater. If she is already frightened, she becomes panicked (and cannot cast) for the duration of the current effect or the duration of the new effect, whichever is greater. Each time a spellcaster becomes panicked, there is a 5% chance she will become permanently insane (as the [insanity](spell/insanity) spell, or the GM may choose [a form of insanity](rule/types_of_insanity).",

This spell resistance cannot be voluntarily lowered. In addition, anytime he casts a spell, he must make a caster level check (1d20 + caster level) against this spell resistance. On a successful check, the spell is completed and the spellcaster's spell resistance is removed until the start of his next turn. Failure indicates he failed to muster up enough magical energy to cast the spell, but the spell is not lost and may be attempted again.

This manifests itself differently depending on whether the spellcaster prepares spells, is a spontaneous caster, or uses spell-like abilities. When preparing spells, an afflicted spellcaster must attempt to prepare as many duplicate spells as she can, meaning she prepares two copies of each spell she picks, but cannot exceed her normal number of spell slots to do so. This need to prepare multiples (thus limiting her versatility) is the only effect. If the spellcaster is a spontaneous caster or uses spell-like abilities, when that spellcaster casts a spell or uses a spell-like ability, she must cast that spell again on her next turn, or becomes dazed for 1 round at the end of her turn. Once she casts two copies of the same spell in a row or becomes dazed, the obsessive fixation resets, and she can cast any spell she knows, starting the cycle again.",

			"**Phase Blight:** A spellcaster afflicted with spellblight fades in and out of existence. Each time she casts a spell, she phases in and out of reality for 1 round per level of the spell cast. While phasing, any physical attacks made against the spellcaster have a 50% miss chance, any individually targeted spell has a 50% chance to fail to affect the caster, and the spellcaster takes only half damage from area attacks. In addition, while actively phasing, all of a spellcaster's physical attacks have a 50% miss chance, all of the caster's spells that target creatures have a 50% chance of affecting the target, and all of the caster's area attacks do 50% of their normal damage.

			"**Spell Burn:** Each time a spellcaster afflicted with this spellblight casts a spell or uses a spell-like ability, her skin feels like it burns, as if she were on fire. With a successful concentration check (DC 15 + twice the spell level cast), the spellcaster can ignore the pain of the effect, but if she fails, she is staggered for a round. While the caster is staggered by this spellblight, any spell with the fire descriptor that she casts has its saving throw DC increased by 1.",

Each time the afflicted spellcaster casts a spell or uses a spell-like ability, she must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC 14 + caster level) or become dazed until the end of her next turn.

However, none of these necessarily bind the outsider to the caster's needs, and a wise spellcaster augments the summoning with additional encouragement, usually in the form of gifts or bargains."

			"The arcane method for binding outsiders is more difficult. First, a binder must create a trap, a [magic circle](spell/magic_circle_against_evil) focused inward. Typically the circle is outlined in a substance that is anathema to the outsider he wishes to summon. He must protect this circle against any sort of disruption, for even the smallest variation in its energies opens the circle and allows the escape of the creature he has summoned. It is for this reason that most binders' lairs are in high towers or deep dungeons, far from wind or pests.",
			"",
			"When an arcane caster speaks the words of the [planar binding](spell/planar_binding) spell, the outsider can resist via a Will saving throw, with no aid from its spell resistance. If it fails the save, the [magic circle](spell/magic_circle_against_evil) draws it inexorably into the trap. Once there, the outsider can pit its spell resistance as a check against the caster's level, attempt to flee via dimensional travel, or attempt to overcome the spell by imposing its spiritual presence with a Charisma check (DC 15 + 1/2 the caster's level + the caster's Charisma modifier). Succeeding at any of these checks breaks the binding, and a fortunate binder suffers no additional harm from such a breach; the annoyed outsider just leaves. This is not always the case, however.",
			"",
			"Some outsiders lash out at their failed binders. Because of this, many binders take additional precautions: a second [magic circle](spell/magic_circle_against_evil) in which they can stand, and [dimensional anchor](spell/dimensional_anchor) cast within the [magic circle](spell/magic_circle_against_evil) to prevent the conjured outsider from fleeing instantly. A tremendously powerful wizard or sorcerer might even use [trap the soul](spell/trap_the_soul) on his victim, forcing it into a prepared vessel until it agrees to the binder's strictures.",
			"",
			"Smart arcane binders often make deals with the creatures they call. Like clerics using [planar ally](spell/planar_ally), they bargain and shower the outsider with gifts in exchange for their services. While it is always good for an arcane spellcaster to make these deals from a position of strength, it is much better to get the outsider to come to mutually agreed upon terms for the service, rather than forcing it to commit actions against its nature or desires."

			"There is one method of outsider coercion that helps guarantee that a binder can bargain from a position of relative security. Many spellcasters believe that a true name is inscribed on the essence of every creature, a secret word that describes it so perfectly and utterly that to speak the name is to define the being. For mortals, this name is buried in the soul, hidden away from prying and dangerous eyes. Outsiders' true names take the form of sigils carved upon their very essence. In Hell, these sigils change as the devil changes in stature, and some that may once have held power over certain devils have become outdated. It is said that some outsiders have assumed names and that they use the aliases to lure foolish mortals into using for summoning; the outsider pretends to be under the control of the binder, but merely bides its time before it strikes.",
			"",
			"To discover a single outsider's true name, a spellcaster must spend at least a month in a library or on a quest of discovery to uncover occult mysteries and riddles hidden in the pages of books, scrolls, and glyphs written millennia ago, buried in ancient temples or found among the ravings of madmen's spellbooks. At the end of this month, the GM makes a Knowledge (planes) check for the character. The DC is 10 + the creature's Hit Dice. The GM can increase the DC by +2, +5, or even +10, based on the power of the outsider or the circumstances of the true name search. A failure by 5 or more turns up false information that may expose researchers to unexpected dangers.",

In summoning, if the name is spoken correctly (requiring knowledge of at least one of the outsider's languages, or a Linguistics skill check with a DC equal to 10 + the creature's Hit Dice), the target takes a -5 penalty on the Will save to resist being conjured, and if its name is inscribed in the protective [magic circle](spell/magic_circle_against_evil), the outsider takes a -5 penalty on all checks to escape or breach that circle.",

However, if the caster speaks the true name of the elemental, the elemental will most likely be intrigued enough to listen-a wizard with power and cunning enough to find an elemental's true name is a wizard with guile and strength, and elementals treasure these qualities.",

			"Not all outsiders have true names. The chaotic and primeval nature of proteans defies the strange logic of true names, as does the writhing chaotic nature of the qlippoth. It is unclear whether aeons have true names. There are those sages who believe each aeon has two true names, and only by finding out both names can a creature gain some control over the aeon, but such matters are purely conjecture."

			"All daemons have a common goal: bringing death, destruction, and pain to mortals. They eat souls, and stop at nothing to sate their hunger for them. Daemons are not to be trifled with. The greater lords of the daemons' the deacons and the Four Horsemen themselves-are almost never summoned. Whether this is because they force others to arrive in their place, or because they have somehow anchored themselves to the plane of Abaddon, none can say with certainty.",
			"",
			"Daemons are immune to acid, death effects, disease, and poison, and all are vulnerable to good and/or silver weapons. They have resistance to cold 10, electricity 10, and fire 10.",

			"**Astradaemon (SR 27):** Powerful but relatively dim hunters of souls, astradaemons can only be bribed into service by two things-a feast of souls and the promise to spread death.",
			"",
			"**Cacodaemon:** Savage and hungry, most cacodaemons cannot suppress their savage natures long enough to make deals. At best, the binder can trick a cacodaemon toward actions in concert with her purposes.",
			"",
			"**Ceustodaemon:** The most common daemons summoned to the Material Plane, ceustodaemons are relatively easy to deal with, though none know if this is because of some deliberate action by more powerful daemons. They are often called guardian daemons, as they are frequently bound to that task.",
			"",
			"**Derghodaemon (SR 23):** No one summons a derghodaemon unless they are stupid, desperate for the services of a savage killer, or both. Less intelligent than cacodaemons and twice as vicious, derghodaemons do not deal with any creature, and relentlessly attempt to escape their binding, usually with brute force.",
			"",
			"**Hydrodaemon (SR 19):** On their home plane, these vile creatures swim the River Styx; on the Material Plane, they are often called to serve as guardians in swamps and sanctuaries of unscrupulous spellcasters. More pliable than most of their fiendish kin, hydrodaemons take treasure and the promise of souls as gifts for their services.",
			"",
			"**Leukodaemon (SR 20):** Leukodaemons are the deacons of the Horseman of Pestilence, and on the rare occasions that they are summoned, they make any deal a binder wants, as long as it somehow results in the spreading of disease and devastation.",
			"",
			"**Meladaemon (SR 22):** As deacons of the Horseman of Famine, meladaemons are rarely summoned by mortal spellcasters, and typically only agree to actions aligned with their own agendas or those of their lord.",
			"",
			"**Olethrodaemon (SR 31):** The mammoth olethrodaemons often make deals with mortals wishing to evoke devastation on rival lands, sometimes even asking only half the normal offering for the privilege. Even those olethrodaemons serving one of the Four Horsemen as paragons can be summoned, though it is often assumed that such a feat is done only at their master's whim.",
			"",
			"**Piscodaemon (SR 21):** Lovers of misery, especially that of the strong and powerful, piscodaemons eagerly make deals with mortals who wish to use them as soldiers against the powers of good-especially armies composed of or led by paladins.",
			"",
			"**Purrodaemon (SR 29):** Steadfast servants of the Horseman of War, purrodaemons may be the easiest deacon daemons to summon. It seems their master often gives them leave to spread war on the Material Plane, but their service to any binder is often brief and violent, for both daemon and spellcaster.",
			"",

Only the offer of a bound CR 15 lawful or good outsider, or a helpless paladin or cleric of 15th level or higher, dims their rage at being snatched from their home. Even thus placated, they will surely seek revenge unless the mortal they face demonstrates a greater power.",

As their dance of ruin attack is more powerful the more vrocks are involved, they are often conjured and bribed in groups.",

When summoned, they typically ask for twice the normal amount in gifts. These demands are often accompanied by outrageous, sometimes impossible demands. They can eventually be reasoned with, but only when binders demonstrate power over them."

The powdered silver used to create the [magic circle](spell/magic_circle_against_evil) is a warning and a trap, but it is not an overt threat-summoned devils recognize it as part of the procedure to call them to the Material Plane. Note that even silver candlesticks or bells can be used as weapons of opportunity, but the best defense, should the wizard choose to display force, is a weapon bonded with alchemical silver.",

If the service takes any longer, the binder takes a -2 Charisma penalty.",

			"**Handmaiden Devil (SR 25):** Deals made with handmaiden devils are often extremely hard bargains. They typically ask for the unthinkable, such as the lives of innocent children-the younger the better.",

However, casters willing to offer an exchange of services-one in which the caster is likely to see the short end of the deal-may earn a Charisma bonus. Those who renege on their bargains with gelugons often learn what it means to displease Hell.",

Only the greatest of promises, such as a noble offering the enslavement of an entire empire, a priest offering the destruction of holy relics, or an antipaladin pledging the delivery of a helpless and noteworthy angel for the pit fiend's pleasure, might induce the pit fiend into service."

Each elemental type is uniquely suited to adapting to conditions on its particular plane, and is arrogant about its powers when surrounded by its element... and uniquely frightened and cowed when shown a greater power or encased in an element not its own. Most elementals do not bargain for favors-they respect only strength. Genies are the more human-like denizens of the elemental planes, both in shape and mentality. They consider themselves physically and culturally superior to true elementals.",
			"",
			"In general, one summons an elemental for brute work and combat, and a genie for magical power or ancient wisdom, and would thus use [summon monster](spell/summon_monster_1) and [planar binding](spell/planar_binding) for those tasks, respectively. However, should a conjurer wish to bind an elemental as he would a genie or fiend, the ritual is one of wrestling with the elemental's creativity in reaching its home element. Elementals are immune to bleed, paralysis, poison, sleep effects, and stunning. They are not subject to critical hits, precision-based attacks like sneak attack, or flanking.",
			"",
			"Genies seek and value power, though they are more brash and boastful than most. It is said the best way to secure the attentions of a genie is to speak its true name, and to offer it aid in battles against its political enemies-a wise conjurer researches the inner battles of geniekind before summoning a genie, or else is prepared to cow the genie with strong magic.",
			"",
			"**Air Elemental:** When summoning an air elemental, inscribe the magic circle with diamond powder, and release the elemental only once it has acquiesced to the caster's power. This costs an additional 2,000 gp but adds +4 to the Charisma check.",

			"**Belker:** These dull-witted creatures enjoy expensive incense and exotic green woods that create heavy smoke.",
			"",
			"**Crysmal:** Unlike other elementals, crysmals do bargain, but agree to a binder's demands only if offered a substantial amount of crystal, which they use for reproduction.",
			"",
			"**Djinni:** Tomes of knowledge or powerful wondrous items tempt djinn and grant the caster a +2 bonus on the Charisma check.",
			"",
			"**Earth Elemental:** Prepare the summoning chamber with swirling wind- and air-based spells to prevent the elemental from touching the floor. Maintaining this state for 5 rounds demonstrates the binder's superiority over the elemental, and grants a +4 bonus on the Charisma check.",
			"",
			"**Efreeti:** These warlike creatures value weapons with enhancement bonuses of at least +2 and scrolls of 4th-level or higher spells; these provide a +2 bonus on the binder's Charisma check. Efreet also appreciate attractive humanoid slaves, which give a +1 bonus on the binder's Charisma check for every 10 slaves offered.",
			"",
			"**Fire Elementals:** When summoning a fire elemental, enclose the casting chamber with stone, remove flammable materials from the room, and prepare a magic circle and spells to protect against fire. Keeping large blocks of ice in the room saps the elemental's power and cows it into submission more quickly, giving the caster a +4 bonus on the Charisma check to trap the elemental.",
			"",
			"**Ice Elemental:** Binders use actual fire, fire spells, protections against cold, and sometimes even fire creatures to keep ice elementals at bay during summoning. An ice elemental often yields to its binder as soon as serious melting occurs.",
			"",
			"**Invisible Stalker:** The tactics used to bind invisible stalkers are similar to those used for binding air elementals. Unlike many elementals, invisible stalkers bargain for their services, which is why they are often summoned by mortal spellcasters.",
			"",
			"**Janni:** The weakest of the genies, the jann are also proud and prone to insult. Gifts of rich fabrics, gems, or jewelry worth 1,000 gp or more soften their outlook and give the conjurer a +2 bonus on her Charisma check.",
			"",
			"**Lightning Elemental:** Lightning elementals are similar to air elementals in that the same bindings work on them, though binders would do well to reinforce such bindings and themselves with protections against electrical damage.",
			"",
			"**Marid:** Capricious and unpredictable, marids love performance and art-providing them artwork worth 1,000 gp or playing a DC 30 Perform (any) piece (whether performed by the binder or his ally) piques their interest long enough for the conjurer to gain a +2 Charisma bonus.",
			"",
			"**Magma Elemental:** Magma elementals are composite elemental creatures, taking some aspects from earth elementals and fire elementals. Unsurprisingly, a mix of binding strategies from those two types of elementals often keeps these savage things at bay.",
			"",
			"**Mihstu (SR 19):** The strategy for binding and commanding these creatures is similar to that for an air elemental. Unlike other elementals, mihstu typically bargain with the binder, as many wish to haunt the dark places of the Material Plane.",
			"",
			"**Mud Elemental:** While mud elementals vary in consistency, all of them fear becoming too watery or too dry, as both conditions have adverse effects on them. Using air spells and petrification spells as punishments for noncompliance usually makes these elementals more willing to take direction and enter into negotiations for appropriate gifts for services rendered.",
			"",
			"**Sandman:** Subtle and craftier than other elementals, these creatures nearly always bargain with their binder, but are arrogant and headstrong. Even after their task is done, they voluntarily remain on the Material Plane to wreak as much havoc as possible.",
			"",
			"**Shaitan:** As the most dense and brash of the genies, shaitans like games of chance and physical skill best of all. Should the caster offer services in exchange for a throw of the dice or a wrestling match-and go through with the offer-he'll receive a +2 bonus on his Charisma check.",
			"",
			"**Thoqqua:** Natives of the harsh landscape where the Planes of Fire and Earth collide, thoqquas are dangerous creatures to summon and bind, and typically rage against their confines, even when properly bound. Those wishing to bind a thoqqua frequently use mephit intermediaries, as those creatures seem to understand thoqquas enough to calm them.",
			"",
			"**Water Elemental:** When summoning a water elemental, remove sources of water from the room and prepare a bonfire. A ring of fire around the magic circle exposes the elemental to its hated enemy the instant it appears on the Material Plane, distracting it long enough for the binder to seize control. This is an opposed Will check, granting a +1 bonus to the caster for each large fire in the room; success grants a +4 bonus on the Charisma check."

			"The [Craft Construct](feat/craft_construct) feat allows a spellcaster to create all manner of permanent constructs in a process much like magic item creation. Each construct has a purchase price and a crafting cost, along with a list of requirements and the skills used to create them. Some require special materials in addition to the cost for basic crafting supplies, generally for the construct's body. Special material costs increase both the purchase price and the crafting cost of the construct. The DC to craft a construct is 5 + the default caster level of the construct, just like for a magic item. Like when crafting magic items, a creator with a sufficiently high skill bonus may ignore these requirements. Each missing requirement increases the Craft DC by 5. Regardless, the creator must meet all item creation feats and minimum caster level requirements. Crafting a construct takes 1 day per 1,000 gp in the item's base price, excluding any special material costs. This process is identical to the process for crafting a magic item, including the rules for accelerating creation and handling interruptions."

			"This section provides guidelines for those seeking to calculate the costs of crafting their own constructs. As a rough guideline, a construct's price is equal to its challenge rating squared, then multiplied by 500 gp. Constructs with a fractional CR rating base their price on that fraction of 500 gp. For example, a CR 1/2 construct has a price of 250 gp. The cost of magical supplies for the [Craft Construct](feat/craft_construct) feat is half this price, with the construct taking 1 day to create per 1,000 gp of the construct's base price. Some constructs, particularly golems, have additional raw material costs that must be paid in full, regardless of whether the creator possesses the [Craft Construct](feat/craft_construct) feat. Raw materials typically cost somewhere between 5% and 10% of the construct's base price.",
			"",
			"Constructs with multiple special abilities cost more to create. The first special ability is included in the construct's base cost. The next two special abilities increase the calculated price by +1/2 CR per ability. Thereafter, any additional special abilities add +1 CR per ability. Examples of special abilities include having a higher DR value than a typical construct of its CR (above DR 5 for CRs 1-8, above DR 10 for CR 9+), monster statistics that exceed those recommended for the [construct's CR](rule/step_2_target_statistics), the standard golem immunity to magic, DR or hardness that can't be overcome by all adamantine weapons, ability to be fully healed by a single spell, and most special attacks and special qualities.",
			"",
			"Particularly powerful special abilities, such as an iron golem's exceptionally high attack bonus, count as two lesser abilities. Animated objects are a special case- their base price is not increased by any abilities paid for with Construction Points (see the [Animated Object monster entry](monster/animated_object_monster_entry)), since these abilities are already factored into an animated object's CR. In addition, golems and homunculi created with extra Hit Dice, the advanced template, or shield guardian abilities should all be priced as described in the Bestiary, rather than by adjusting pricing for their new CR.",
			"",
			"Abilities that weaken or potentially place a construct at a disadvantage rarely reduce the construct's price. An exception is the berserk ability. Constructs that have a chance of going berserk receive -1 CR adjustment to their calculated price if control can be reestablished (like a flesh golem) or -2 CR adjustment for permanent loss of control (like a clay golem).",
			"",
			"The following is an example of the calculated costs for creating a stone golem (CR 11). A stone golem's special abilities are golem immunity to magic, full healing from [transmute mud to rock](spell/transmute_mud_to_rock), a high to-hit bonus (+22 vs. the +19 typical for CR 11), and the ability to slow its foes. Further, since its spell vulnerabilities are not tied to common spells or effects, its immunity to magic cost is doubled, giving the stone golem a total of 5 special abilities. The first special ability doesn't affect the cost, the next two increase the cost by +1/2 CR each, and the final two each increase the cost by +1 CR individually, making its effective CR for pricing equal to 14. This produces a calculated price of 98,000 gp, rounded up to an even 100,000 gp.",
			"",
			"When designing a new construct, keep in mind that the above pricing formula only serves as a guideline.

You may decide to design a spell to fill that niche, modeling it after [burning hands](spell/burning_hands), except dealing sonic damage instead of fire-perhaps you'd call it sonic screech. However, there's a reason there aren't as many sonic spells in the game: \"sonic\" as an energy type is a late addition to the rules, and very few monsters have any resistance to sonic damage because most monsters existed before \"sonic\" was defined as an energy type. Because there are fewer creatures with sonic resistance than creatures with fire resistance, sonic screech will almost always be a better spell than [burning hands](spell/burning_hands). That means if you introduce sonic screech into your game, you'll see savvy players selecting it instead of burning hands. If a new spell displaces an existing spell from the roster of most spellcasters, it probably means it's better than the other available choices-and if it's so good that it's obviously the best spell choice, it's probably overpowered. Understanding the entire system of rules can help you avoid mistakes like this."

Technically, a spell that only affects the caster (with a range of \"personal\" and target of \"you\") is slightly weaker than one with a target of \"one creature,\" because being able to cast the spell on anyone makes it more versatile and thus more powerful. However, the slight decrease in power from making a spell \"caster-only\" should not be used to justify designing the spell at a lower level. In most cases, the caster-only spells are designed that way either because they've always worked that way, or because they provide a bonus that is unique and advantageous for that class, but that could get out of hand if you allowed anyone to get the benefit of the spell by casting it on them or drinking a potion of that spell; these spells should remain caster-only, but you should examine their power level as if you could cast them on anyone.",
			"",
			"**Example:** [Shield](spell/shield) and [true strike](spell/true_strike) are both 1st-level spells that only affect the caster. If you could cast those spells on others, they'd still be at the right power level for 1st-level spells-they aren't 2nd-level spells that you knocked down a level because you designed them as caster-only. [Shield](spell/shield) has always been a spell that only affects the caster, and there's a game-balance reason to keep it that way: because [shield](spell/shield) grants a shield bonus, casting it on a melee character means the fighter could drop his actual shield and start wielding his weapon two-handed for extra damage. [True strike](spell/true_strike) was deliberately designed as a caster-only spell so a sorcerer couldn't just cast it every round on the fighter, who'd be guaranteed a hit against a difficult monster even if he used [Combat Expertise](feat/combat_expertise) (for extra AC) and [Power Attack](feat/power_attack) (for extra damage). Making those spells caster-only doesn't really weaken the spells, but it does prevent players from exploiting certain combinations that would make encounters too easy.",
			"",
			"A spell that affects multiple creatures is more powerful than a spell that only affects one creature. Multiple-creature spells tend to either be area effects such as cones and spheres (like [fireball](spell/fireball)), or allow the caster to select multiple targets as long as no two targets are more than a set distance apart (like [slow](spell/slow)). A burst effect like [fireball](spell/fireball) can potentially affect many more enemies than a pick-your- targets spell like [slow](spell/slow), but you never risk hitting your friends when you use [slow](spell/slow). Select which type is most appropriate for the spell, but understand that selecting multiple targets is generally more powerful except at the lowest caster levels (where a low caster level means few targets compared to a burst which can affect many)."

[Magic missile](spell/magic_missile) can be used against a single target, or the caster can split up the missiles to affect multiple creatures, dividing the single-target damage among them. [Burning hands](spell/burning_hands) initially looks like it doesn't obey the damage cap table because it deals multiple dice of damage against multiple creatures, but this is offset by the fact that it only deals d4s instead of d6s, and it has an extremely close and limited area of effect.",

			"When looking at the Maximum Damage tables, also keep in mind that arcane spells usually use d6s for damage and divine spells usually use d8s, and these tables assume d6s; when looking at the damage caps for divine spells, count each d8 as 2d6. Thus, [searing light](spell/searing_light) is a 3rd-level single-target cleric spell that deals up to 5d8 points of damage; treating each d8 as 2d6, that counts as 10d6, which is on target for a 3rd-level cleric spell. (Note that the 1d6 per level and maximum 10d6 points of damage against undead are still correct for a spell of this level, and the slightly higher damage against light-vulnerable undead is offset by the reduced damage against constructs).",

Requiring the caster to touch a target with a hostile spell means the caster is in or very close to melee combat, and is risking retaliation from enemies and attacks of opportunity from threatening opponents. Similarly, while close-range spells give the caster a little more breathing room, a hostile target is generally within the range of a single move or a charge, allowing an opponent to close and attack the caster-even at caster level 14, a close-range spell only reaches 60 feet.",

Even outdoors, a spell with a 150-foot range can hit anything in sight on a typical game mat like a Paizo GameMastery Flip-Mat (24 inches by 30 inches is 120 feet by 150 feet). Long range is likewise all-encompassing, with a 400-foot minimum range translating to almost 7 feet on a game mat-longer than many tables used for gaming. Long range only comes into play in abstract situations like launching a [fireball](spell/fireball) at enemies across a large prairie, using [dimension door](spell/dimension_door) to return to an earlier (and safer) part of the dungeon, and so on.",
			"",
			"Obviously, touch-range spells are the weakest type of spell, close-range spells are better but not extremely so, and medium- and long-range spells may as well be identical for most purposes. Given that the [Enlarge Spell](feat/enlarge_spell) feat doubles a spell's range at a cost of +1 spell level, and the [Reach Spell](feat/reach_spell) feat increases the range by one category (from touch to close, close to medium, medium to long), at a cost of +1 spell level, it's reasonable to balance a spell by assuming a +1 increase in level corresponds to increasing the range category by one. For example, a spell that works like [cure light wounds](spell/cure_light_wounds) (normally 1st level) at close range instead of touch is appropriate for a 2nd-level spell."

In general, making a successful Reflex save means the target dodged the effect, or the effect rolled over or around the target with a lesser effect.

Golems in particular are often the intended targets of these spell designs, as their immunity to magic ability makes them completely immune to any effect that allows spell resistance.

The fur and glass rod material components of [lightning bolt](spell/lightning_bolt) come from the ability to create a buildup of static electricity by rubbing fur against a glass rod. The game could present those spells without material components at all, and it would have a negligible effect on how the game plays (as proven by the \"it has whatever I need\" spell component pouch, and the sorcerer class getting Eschew Materials as a bonus feat)-they're just in the spell for fun. Balance your spell assuming it has no material components or free material components, and then add them in if the flavor seems appropriate.",
			"",
			"Costly material components should be used to prevent overzealous players from casting the spell as often as they want, because the spell either makes adventuring too easy if everyone in the party has it (such as [stoneskin](spell/stoneskin)), allows the PCs to bypass key adventuring experiences like exploring and investigating (such as [augury](spell/augury), [divination](spell/divination), and [commune](spell/commune)), or allows the PCs to trivialize certain threats (such as [raise dead](spell/raise_dead) and [restoration](spell/restoration)). Balance a spell without costly material components if possible, usually by raising the spell level if it is too good for the intended level. Sometimes the power level of a spell is on target (like [augury](spell/augury), as it makes sense to have a low-level divination spell for clerics), but the spell is valuable enough that players will overuse it if it's free, so you have to apply a gp cost to moderate how often the PCs use it. Long-lasting defensive spells such as [glyph of warding](spell/glyph_of_warding) also fit into this category; if they were free, every spellcaster would cover her lair in them, casting one per day for the weeks or months of planning the NPC has before the PCs arrive. By giving [glyph of warding](spell/glyph_of_warding) a gp cost, it allows for more traditional adventuring-otherwise every square the PCs walk on is a potential trap, slowing play to a crawl as the PCs are forced to slowly and carefully search every square to notice the glyphs (given that a typical 5th-level rogue has +14 to Perception against a DC 28 glyph, meaning she fails most searches unless she takes 20).",
			"",
			"Focus components are governed by the same rules as material components-in most cases they're just there for flavor, and are only relevant if costly. A costly focus is like a costly material component, except it's a one-time expenditure rather than a repeat expenditure, a barrier to entry that you can ignore once they've crossed the threshold. A costly focus is a good way to delay when PCs gain access to the spell, but once they have the materials, it's essentially just like any other spell without a costly focus. As with material components, balance the spell for its level, and if it seems like the spell is too good and delaying access to it would help moderate it, consider adding a costly focus component."

If the spell allows the caster to choose from several options, put each option on its own line with an italicized name (see [binding](spell/binding) for an example).",
			"",
			"Anything that appears in the spell stat block doesn't need to appear again in the spell description-it's redundant. For example, the [fireball](spell/fireball) description doesn't say, \"The spell can reach up to 400 feet plus 40 feet per caster level.\" Extraneous text like that is just more clutter for the player to sift through when looking up the spell's effects in the middle of combat.",
			"",
			"Avoid using language that implies something that the game mechanics of the spell don't back up. For example, a spell's description shouldn't say \"using the foul powers of necromancy\" if the spell doesn't actually have some sort of evil effect or the evil descriptor. This sort of mistake is most common with necromancy spells, which include not only many obviously evil spells, but also a fair share of helpful ones as well (such as [astral projection](spell/astral_projection), [gentle repose](spell/gentle_repose), and [undeath to death](spell/undeath_to_death)).

You have to think of the spell in the hands of the biggest power gamer, and in use by a character who is very different than the one for whom it is designed. Even a simple sorcerer/wizard spell has to deal with two different types of casters: a wizard, who can learn many spells but can only cast a few per day, and a sorcerer, who knows few spells but can cast many per day. A spell that is good for a wizard may be too good when used by a sorcerer because the sorcerer can use it more times per day. Likewise, think of what happens if the PCs can access the spell in potion or scroll form-you may intend for the spell to be rare and for the PCs to not have it most of the time, but a wizard can create scrolls of rarely used spells and save them for just the right opportunity.",

			"**Source** [Ultimate Magic pg. 135](source/ultimate_magic)",
			"",
			"When it comes to attack spells, there is a clear hierarchy of what kinds of effects are better than others. Here are the attack effects in order of best effect to worst, assuming all other factors (specific immunities, number of targets affected, and so on) are equal.",
			"",
			"**Control:** A control spell puts an opponent under your control, turning him into an ally or at least keeping him from being an active enemy for a while. This is the best kind of attack spell because not only does it negate an opponent (the same effect as a kill or incapacitate spell), but it also creates a new ally that the caster can turn against his other opponents. Many of the more powerful enchantment spells are control spells, though their drawback is that they tend to be all-or-nothing (if the creature saves, it's completely unaffected by the spell). Examples of control spells are [charm monster](spell/charm_monster), [charm person](spell/charm_person), [confusion](spell/confusion), [dominate monster](spell/dominate_monster), and [dominate person](spell/dominate_person).",
			"",
			"**Kill:** A kill spell kills or destroys an opponent outright, bypassing the target's depletable statistics, typically with a Fortitude saving throw. Kill spells are better than incapacitate spells because they don't wear off and there's no chance another enemy can easily reverse the spell (such as with [dispel magic](spell/dispel_magic)). The best of the kill spells still act as damage spells if the target saves, so the caster is guaranteed some effect. Examples of kill spells are [disintegrate](spell/disintegrate), [finger of death](spell/finger_of_death), [phantasmal killer](spell/phantasmal_killer), [power word kill](spell/power_word_kill), [slay living](spell/slay_living), and [wail of the banshee](spell/wail_of_the_banshee).",
			"",
			"**Incapacitate:** An incapacitate spell makes the target unable to act against the caster, effectively removing him from a battle for a period of time (possibly permanently) but at the risk of other opponents reversing the incapacitated target's condition. Spells that cause an enemy to flee count as incapacitate spells. Incapacitate spells are better than damage spells because they allow the caster to bypass a target's depletable statistics, sometimes disabling an opponent with a single spell. Examples of incapacitate spells are [fear](spell/fear), [flesh to stone](spell/flesh_to_stone), [hold monster](spell/hold_monster), [hold person](spell/hold_person), [power word stun](spell/power_word_stun), and [sleep](spell/sleep).",
			"",
			"**Damage:** A damage spell reduces the target's depletable statistics, bringing the target closer to the point where that damage incapacitates it. Damage spells are reliable spells because all creatures have depletable statistics of some sort and because most nonmagical attacks affect depletable statistics (which means that the caster's fighter and rogue allies are helping overcome the opponent). Damage spells are better than penalize spells because damage always stacks (penalties do not) and if the caster and his allies deal enough damage, they'll eventually disable an opponent, whereas it's possible to add penalties almost indefinitely and still have a somewhat viable opponent. Examples of damage spells are [cone of cold](spell/cone_of_cold), [fireball](spell/fireball), [lightning bolt](spell/lightning_bolt), [magic missile](spell/magic_missile), [poison](spell/poison), and [sound burst](spell/sound_burst).",
			"",
			"**Penalize:** A penalize spell gives the target some penalty not related to its depletable statistics, such as an attack penalty, an Armor Class penalty, restrictions on the kinds of actions it can take, and so on. Penalize spells are the weakest sort of spells because in most cases the caster can't kill an opponent with penalties and the penalties don't stack with themselves, so the caster and his allies have to deal with the penalized opponent in some other way (typically through damage spells and nonmagical attacks). Examples of penalize spells are [bane](spell/bane), [blindness/deafness](spell/blindness_deafness), [ray of enfeeblement](spell/ray_of_enfeeblement), and [slow](spell/slow).",
			"",
			"There are exceptions to the above categories. For example, if dealing with a monster that has a lot of hit points and deals substantial damage but only has a moderate chance of harming the caster's allies, the caster may be better off trying to give the opponent an attack penalty (to decrease the chance of the monster hitting) than trying to wear down its hit points (because during that time the monster may be dealing a lot of damage to the caster's allies). In this case, a penalize spell that reduces its attack bonus is better than a damage spell. As another example, the PCs may need to question a defeated opponent, in which case an incapacitate spell is a better choice than a kill spell (unless the PCs have some really good magic that lets them question the dead more effectively than [speak with dead](spell/speak_with_dead)).",
			"",
			"Spells with variable effects may be more than one type of spell in the hierarchy depending on the results-a [confusion](spell/confusion) spell that causes a monster to babble incoherently is an incapacitate spell, but if the spell causes it to attack one of its allies, it's a control spell. Likewise, a [summon monster](spell/summon_monster_1) spell that summons a fiendish constrictor snake is an incapacitate spell if the snake grapples an enemy, but it's just a damage spell if it summons a fiendish boar, which only deals damage and has no special attacks. Balancing these spells is tricky, as you have to consider their optimal usage."

			"Depletable statistics are any values in a creature or object's stat block that can be reduced by some form of attack and that can neutralize, kill, or destroy the creature or object when they reach a low value (typically 0). Hit points, ability scores, and levels are all depletable statistics-a creature falls unconscious below 0 hit points and eventually dies; objects, undead, and constructs are destroyed at 0 hit points; creatures are made helpless or killed by bringing an ability score to 0; creatures die when their negative levels equal their total Hit Dice. Many magical attacks and most nonmagical attacks reduce a target's depletable statistics in some way, eventually defeating the target.",
			"",
			"However, attack bonuses, saving throw bonuses, Armor Class, hardness, CMB, CMD, initiative, speed, skill modifiers, and most other game statistics are not depletable statistics because no matter how low these statistics get, the affected creature or object is still able to take actions. For example, a spell that gives a target a -10 attack penalty has little effect on a sorcerer casting fireball, as would a spell that gave her a -10 penalty on her Will saving throws; despite her poor attack rolls and miserable Will saves, she is still quite capable of blasting her opponents to bits, whether these penalties are -10 or -100. Similarly, a fighter with a -10 penalty on Fortitude saving throws can still swing a sword, as can one with a -10 penalty to Armor Class; the fighter is still viable despite these penalties.",
			"",
			"\"Depletable statistic\" isn't an official game term, but it is a helpful concept when comparing power levels of spells-attacking depletable statistics is a war of attrition that can eventually wear down the target, whereas adding penalties to non-depletable statistics may have no effect at all, as the target may have other attacks that allow them to ignore those penalties."

			"**Disease:** Disease effects give the target a disease, which may be an invading organism such as a bacteria or virus, an abnormal internal condition (such as a cancer or mental disorder), or a recurring magical effect that acts like one of the former. Creatures with resistance or immunity to disease apply that resistance to their saving throw and the effects of disease spells.",
			"",
			"**Earth:** Spells that manipulate earth or conjure creatures from earth-dominant planes or with the earth subtype should have the earth descriptor.",
			"",
			"**Electricity:** Electricity effects involve the presence and flow of electrical charge, whether expressed in amperes or volts. Electricity deals damage to creatures by disrupting their biological systems. It deals damage to objects (as well as creatures) by heating the material it passes through, and thus technically many electricity spells could also be treated as fire spells, but for sake of game simplicity, it is better to just let electricity-based spells deal electricity damage. Electricity effects may stun, paralyze, or even kill.",
			"",
			"**Emotion:** Spells with this descriptor create emotions or manipulate the target's existing emotions. Most emotion spells are enchantments, except for fear spells, which are usually necromancy.",
			"",
			"**Evil:** Spells that draw upon evil powers or conjure creatures from evil-aligned planes or with the evil subtype should have the evil descriptor.",
			"",
			"**Fear:** Spells with the fear descriptor create, enhance, or manipulate fear. Most fear spells are necromancy spells, though some are enchantment spells.",
			"",
			"**Fire:** Fire effects make the target hotter by creating fire, directly heating the target with magic or friction. Lava, steam, and boiling water all deal fire damage. Fire effects can also cause confusion, dizziness, exhaustion, fatigue, nausea, unconsciousness, and death. Spells that manipulate fire or conjure creatures from fire-dominant planes or with the fire subtype should have the fire descriptor.",
			"",
			"**Force:** Spells with the force descriptor create or manipulate magical force. Force spells affect incorporeal creatures normally (as if they were corporeal creatures).",
			"",
			"**Good:** Spells that draw upon the power of true goodness or conjure creatures from good-aligned planes or with the good subtype should have the good descriptor.",
			"",
			"**Language-Dependent:** A language-dependent spell uses intelligible language as a medium for communication. If the target cannot understand or hear what the caster of a language-dependent spell says, the spell has no effect, even if the target fails its saving throw.",
			"",
			"**Lawful:** Spells that draw upon the power of true law or conjure creatures from law-aligned planes or with the lawful subtype should have the law descriptor.",
			"",
			"**Light:** Spells that create significant amounts of light or attack darkness effects should have the light descriptor. Giving a spell the light descriptor indicates whether a spell like darkness is high enough level counter or dispel it.",
			"",
			"**Mind-Affecting:** Mindless creatures (those with an Intelligence score of ---) and undead are immune to mind-affecting effects.",
			"",
			"**Pain:** Pain effects cause unpleasant sensations without any permanent physical damage (though a sensitive target may suffer mental repercussions from lengthy exposure to pain). Creatures that are immune to effects that require a Fort save (such as constructs and undead) are immune to pain effects.",
			"",
			"**Poison:** Poison effects use poison, venom, drugs, or similar toxic substances to disrupt and damage living creatures through chemical reactions. Technically, acids and poisons are both chemical reactions, but for the purpose of the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game, they are categorized as different effects, with acids dealing hit point damage and poisons causing ability damage, ability drain, bleeding, confusion, convulsions, nausea, paralysis, reduced healing, suffocation, unconsciousness, or death. Creatures with resistance to poison (such as dwarves) apply that resistance to their saving throws and the effects of poison spells. Creatures with immunity are immune to poisonous aspects of poison spells, but not necessarily all effects of the spell (for example, a spell that creates a pit full of liquid poison could still trap or drown a poison-immune creature).",
			"",
			"**Shadow:** Shadow spells manipulate matter or energy from the Shadow Plane, or allow transport to or from that plane.",
			"",
			"**Sonic:** Sonic effects transmit energy to the target through frequent oscillations of pressure through the air, water, or ground. Sounds that are too high or too low for the humanoid ear to detect can still transmit enough energy to cause harm, which means that these effects can even affect deafened creatures. Sound effects can cause hit point damage, deafness, dizziness, nausea, pain, shortness of breath, and temporary blindness, and can detect creatures using batlike echolocation.",
			"",
			"**Water:** Spells that manipulate water or conjure creatures from water-dominant planes or with the water subtype should have the water descriptor."

As with magic items, the creator invests time and money in the creation process and at the end attempts a single skill check to complete construction. Since technological items do not have caster levels, the DC of this check is defined in the description of each technological item. Failing this check means that the item does not function and the materials are wasted. Failing this check by 5 or more may result in a catastrophic failure, such as electrocution or an explosion, at the GM's discretion.",

Using a crafting lab to build a high-tech item consumes an amount of power each day. Days when the crafting lab is without power effectively delay continued construction of a high-tech item, but time already spent building the item is not lost. In addition, crafting an item requires an expenditure of time (from a character with the appropriate crafting feat) and an expenditure of money used to secure the technological components and expendable resources needed for the work.",

When determining the required time, ignore any fixed costs such as the weapon portion of implanted weaponry.",

Ideally, the creator can work for at least 4 hours at a time uninterrupted, but if this is not possible (such as while adventuring), the creator can devote 4 hours of work broken up over the day, accomplishing a net of 2 hours of progress. Work under distracting or dangerous conditions nets only half the progress as well. If the creator can't dedicate at least 4 hours of work during a day (even if broken up or under distracting conditions), any work performed that day is wasted.",

In theory, a magic item creator could even infuse a technological item with magical intelligence. To create a magical high-tech item like this, one must first secure the high-tech item itself, either via purchase, discovery, or crafting. All high-tech weapons and armor are considered masterwork for the purposes of adding magical enhancements to them (though they do not gain the other typical benefits for masterwork items). At the GM's discretion, some magical special abilities might simply not be appropriate for application to certain technological items. When a character crafts an existing technological item into a magic item in this manner, he does not need to meet the base item's crafting requirements-a wizard with [Craft Magic Arms and Armor](feat/craft_magic_arms_and_armor) can create a +1 arc pistol from a normal [arc pistol](tech/weapon/arc_pistol) without having [Craft Technological Arms and Armor](feat/craft_technological_arms_and_armor) and without having access to a [military laboratory](rule/crafting_laboritories).

There's no extra cost associated with technological items since they have extra weaknesses to go along with their advantages. Items that use charges should be priced as if they were use-activated, not as if they were charged in the way a wand or ring of the ram is charged, unless the item is disposable and has 50 or fewer charges, as the assumption is that a newly crafted technological item can be recharged with relative ease."

			"To set a technological campaign apart from a standard fantasy adventure, you need a variety of unusual futuristic items. But be it a laser gun in the hands of a terrible enemy or a set of strange gravity armor found in the treasure trove of an oddly uniform metal dungeon, technology from the future (or even the present-day real world) in a fantasy setting should be handled in a manner similar to magic items elsewhere in the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game.",
			"",
			"Many technological items replicate specific spells or magical effects. However, they do not use magic in any way, and thus function normally in areas of antimagic or primal magic, and are otherwise unaffected by any effects that target or affect magic items.",
			"",
			"This section collects dozens of new items in the following categories.",
			"",
			"**Weapons:** The majority of technological weapons are ranged weapons, although some high-tech melee weapons can be found in dungeons as well.",
			"",
			"**Armor:** Technological armor works in a similar manner to standard armor, but often requires a power source to fully function.",
			"",
			"**Pharmaceuticals:** Pharmaceuticals include drugs, poisons, and medicines. They can be ingested or injected, and generally have relatively minor or temporary effects.",
			"",
			"**Cybertech:** Cybertech is a form of technology that must be implanted in a body before it can function. Cybertech typically augments a character's abilities and statistics.",
			"",
			"**Technological Gear:** This catchall category includes a wide range of devices, from relatively minor gizmos like zipsticks to technological wonders like clonepods.",
			"",
			"### Color Code",
			"",
			"Many technological items follow a color code that organizes similar items (such as nanite hypoguns, force fields, or gravity clips) according to their overall power. The power level for each color is listed below. Note that there are nine colors in the scale-the effects of an item of any individual color should roughly correspond to the power level of a spell of the associated level. Seven of these colors are associated with the seven skymetals. The least of the colors, brown, is associated with base ores, while the greatest of the colors, prismatic, is associated with all of the skymetals. In some technological items, actual skymetals of the appropriate color are used in the creation of the object, but in most, synthetic plastics and metals are used in place of the more valuable skymetals.",
			"",
			"*Brown:* Roughly equivalent to a 1st-level spell. This color is not associated with skymetal.",
			"",
			"*Black:* Roughly equivalent to a 2nd-level spell. This color is associated with adamantine.",
			"",
			"*White:* Roughly equivalent to a 3rd-level spell. This color is associated with siccatite.",
			"",
			"*Gray:* Roughly equivalent to a 4th-level spell. This color is associated with inubrix.",
			"",
			"*Green:* Roughly equivalent to a 5th-level spell. This color is associated with noqual.",
			"",
			"*Red:* Roughly equivalent to a 6th-level spell. This color is associated with djezet.",
			"",
			"*Blue:* Roughly equivalent to a 7th-level spell. This color is associated with abysium.",
			"",
			"*Orange:* Roughly equivalent to an 8th-level spell. This color is associated with horacalcum.",
			"",
			"*Prismatic:* Roughly equivalent to a 9th-level spell. This color is associated with all skymetals.",
			"",
			"### Power Sources",
			"",
			"Most of the technological wonders presented here require energy to function. These items each have a capacity score, which indicates the maximum number of charges the item can store at any one time. The number of charges an item consumes when it is used varies from item to item. An item's capacity can be filled from any power source-like a battery or a generator-as a standard action. When an item is charged, it always takes as many charges from the attached power source as it can hold, filling as close to its capacity as possible. Note that charging an item from a generator is more efficient, as any charges drained from a battery in excess of the number of charges an item can store are lost.",
			"",
			"### Timeworn Technology",
			"",
			"The equipment presented in this section is described in full working condition and priced as such. While a high-technology setting may have many fully functional technological devices in it, that isn't the case in the campaign setting. Equipment that has been damaged or degraded over time works less consistently and is worth less money than new technological items. Such equipment is called [\"timeworn.\"](rule/timeworn_technology)"

			"The technology found in the hands of Numeria's denizens isn't usually pristine. Between languishing in forgotten ruins open to the elements, being used by those ignorant of the nature of this technology, and having no one skilled at building, maintaining, or repairing such devices, most technological items are \"timeworn\"-damaged and malfunctioning (when not completely nonfunctional). These malfunctions manifest in two ways: limited charges and glitches.",
			"",
			"Only technological items that consume charges (including nanite canisters) or are pharmaceutical items can be affected by these timeworn rules, though any technological item can still become broken or nonfunctional just as any other item.",
			"",
			"A piece of timeworn technology may have additional aesthetic and functional differences from a new piece of the same equipment. Many of these effects are purely cosmetic, such as cracks in the casing of an arc grenade or primitive etchings on a suit of technological armor placed there by a barbarian millennia ago. Pieces of timeworn technology may also have minor mechanical effects beyond glitches (at the GM's discretion). A timeworn laser pistol might constantly hum at a low but noticeable frequency, imparting a -1 penalty on Stealth checks. A timeworn plasma grenade could be caked in a strange viscous fluid that has a pungent odor, making its wielder more easily tracked via scent. Timeworn technological items should clearly evoke a sense of age and danger, and even the most standard piece of Androffan gear can be made unique based on individual deteriorations.",
			"",
			"Note that not every technological item in Numeria is timeworn, but most technology that PCs encounter outside of the deepest and most remote of Numerian ruins will be (though the Technic League jealously guards a significant number of pristine technological artifacts). These items function as presented in the previous chapter, can be recharged, and do not suffer glitches.",
			"",
			"A timeworn technological item that is still somewhat functioning is worth half of its normal listed price, though one drained of its charges is worth 1% of its normal value, as a curiosity to collectors. Timeworn technology also has the following properties.",
			"",
			"**Non-Rechargable:** Timeworn technological items can't be recharged. When a timeworn technological item is properly identified or first used, roll randomly to determine how many charges it has left before it becomes useless.",
			"",
			"**Glitches:** Timeworn technology sometimes doesn't work the way it was originally intended to. When an item glitches, its effect is hampered or enhanced, as determined by a d% roll. See the inside front cover for a complete list of glitch effects for armor, weapons, pharmaceuticals, and other technological equipment. Not all glitches are catastrophic; they represent unpredictable effects, for good and ill.",
			"",
			"When a timeworn technological item is first used after a month or more of inactivity, there's a 50% chance that it will glitch. Additionally, when using an item in a way that would drain its last charge, there's a 50% chance it will glitch. If an item requires a d20 roll (such as a skill check or an attack roll) to activate or use, it has a 50% chance to glitch on a natural 1."

Radiation is a poison effect whose initial effect causes Constitution drain and secondary effect causes Strength damage. Radiation dangers are organized into four categories: low, medium, high, and severe.",
			"",
			"**Area of Effect:** Radiation suffuses a spherical area of effect that can extend into solid objects. The closer one gets to the center of an area of radiation, the stronger the radiation effect becomes. Radiation entries list the maximum level of radiation in an area, as well as the radius out to which this radiation level applies. Each increment up to an equal length beyond that radius degrades the radiation strength by one level. For example, a spherical area of high radiation with a radius of 20 feet creates a zone of medium radiation 21 feet to 40 feet from the center in all directions, and a similar zone of low radiation from 41 to 60 feet.",
			"",
			"**Initial Effect:** Radiation initially deals Constitution drain unless the affected character succeeds at a Fortitude save. A new saving throw must be attempted to resist radiation's initial damage each round a victim remains exposed to it.",
			"",
			"**Secondary Effect:** Secondary effects from radiation deal Strength damage at a much slower rate than most poisons. This secondary effect ends only after a character succeeds at two consecutive Fortitude saving throws to resist secondary radiation damage. If a character has Strength damage equal to his current Strength score, further damage dealt by a secondary effect is instead Constitution damage.",
			"",
			"**Removing Radiation Effects:** All radiation damage is a poison effect, and as such it can be removed with any effect that neutralizes poison. [Ability damage and drain](rule/ability_score_damage,_penalty,_and_drain) caused by radiation damage can be healed normally",

The same energies that can be shaped to create explosive fireballs, raise the dead, divine the future, heal the sick, and summon demons can do that and more without the direction of skilled spellcasters. Normally, this unfocused magical potential does not exist in reality; it lies beyond reality, where it waits to be tapped. Where exactly magic comes from remains a lively debate today, but when magic is unleashed without any attempt to focus it-when it leaks into the world in its raw form-the result is known as primal magic.",
			"",
			"In some realms, particularly in planes like the Maelstrom or the Abyss in the Great Beyond, magic is left to indulge in its raw chaos as it wishes-here, primal magic is often called \"wild magic.\" On the Material Plane, the world feels the touch of primal magic when the laws of reality themselves have been damaged. Here, magic flows in unpredictable tides and currents. At one moment, a region might function normally while at another, magic won't function at all. Usually, though, primal magic holds sway.",
			"",
			"Manifestations of primal magic tend to build up potential before they explode into existence. Just as a thunderstorm doesn't constantly lance the ground below with a constant beam of lightning, these bolts manifest periodically and almost randomly. And just as lightning can be called with lightning rods, primal magic can be purposefully or accidentally drawn out by utilizing magic in areas where such energies are building.",
			"",
			"When primal magic manifests, roll on the sample Primal Magic Events table to determine what occurs. As the primal magic exerts its power, consider crossing off the effect that occurs and designing replacement events and effects. If you want primal magic to play a big role in your campaign, you should try to ensure that no two effects are ever quite the same. One easy way to achieve this is to simply substitute random spell effects with unusual descriptions in place of normal ones, such as a black fireball that smells of roses and deals acid damage.",
			"",
			"Spontaneous primal magic effects can occur as often or as infrequently as you wish, but as a general rule, try to limit the effects to one per combat encounter at most. The majority of primal magic effects should instead occur when creatures activate magic items, use spell-like abilities, or cast spells in such an area (simply carrying a magic item or gaining the benefits of a constant-use item or spell effect isn't enough-it's the actual act of activation or casting that triggers primal magic). When a creature activates a magic item, casts a spell, or uses a spell-like ability in an area infused with primal magic, there's a 50% chance that the spell effect is replaced by a primal magic effect. A spellcaster casting a spell, using a spell-like ability, or activating a spell completion or spell trigger magic item can make a concentration check (DC = 15 + twice the spell's level) to focus the magic and avoid triggering a primal magic effect. Creatures activating other kinds of magic items do not have the option of making a spellcraft check to avoid triggering a primal magic effect.",

When the effect occurs, you need to determine the CR of the event. If the event is triggered by a spellcaster or a magic item, the event's CR is equal to the spellcaster's or item's caster level. When an event occurs naturally, you can roll 1d20 to determine the CR. Of course, you should strongly consider lowering primal magic event CRs to match or at least closely approximate the average party level of your PCs. Not all primal magic events are harmful, but it's neither fun nor fair for players to frequently be hit with an effect that's too far beyond their ability to deal with.",

			"In the sample Primal Magic Events table, the abbreviation \"CR\" is used to indicate a mathematical value; use the primal magic's CR to set this number. For example, a CR 11 primal magic event that lasts for \"CR minutes and affects an area with a radius of CR &times; 5 feet\" lasts for 11 minutes and affects an area with a radius of 55 feet.",

Generally, areas of primal magic form in places afflicted by forces beyond mortal control-areas scoured by godly wrath, breaches between the planes, sites where powerful artifacts were destroyed. In most of these instances, the primal magic subsides as reality repairs itself, though it might take a matter of weeks, years, or even centuries. In the cases of extreme abuse, an area's magical cohesiveness might never recover, resulting in areas of permanent primal magic. In general, the location of existing areas of primal magic and the creation of new areas is left up to the GM, but should always be the result of magic of extraordinary force or of an arcane catastrophe of epic proportions.

This chapter includes advice and adjudications that make it an invaluable resource for those running and playing in aquatic adventures."

			"### The Basics",
			"",
			"The basics of the [Swim skill](skill/swim) are the same in an aquatic campaign. When a creature uses a move or full-round action to swim, it attempts a Swim check against the appropriate DC based on how calm the water is and other local factors. On a success, it can move up to one quarter of its land speed with a single move, or half its land speed with a double move. On a failure, it doesn't make any progress, and on a failure by 5 or more it goes underwater. This last part, however, doesn't make any sense if the PC is already underwater. Instead, if a PC fails her check by 5 or more while underwater (or doesn't spend any actions to swim, thus not even attempting the check), she sinks or rises based on her [buoyancy](rule/buoyancy). While swimming, a PC can't normally use the run or charge actions or take a 5-foot step. Every hour of swimming requires a successful DC 20 Swim check to avoid fatigue. Even on a success, an hour of swimming is still at least as strenuous as marching for an hour, and extensive swimming eventually requires a PC to attempt checks as per [forced marches](rule/overland_movement). Similarly, continually taking a double move to swim at half land speed counts as hustling. A creature can also walk on the ocean floor, lake bed, or other solid ground underwater as long as its buoyancy is swiftly sinking. When it does so, it moves at half its land speed without needing to attempt a Swim check.",
			"",
			"**Swim Speed:** Creatures with a swim speed have a variety of advantages underwater. First of all, they can swim through normal water at their full swim speed without needing to attempt a Swim check. They can use the run and charge actions and take 5-foot steps with their swim speed. When they do need to attempt Swim checks to deal with a hazardous situation or perform a special action, they benefit from a sizable +8 racial bonus on their Swim checks. There might be an unusual circumstance where a creature has a swim speed that's actually slower than one-quarter of its land speed (for instance, a monk using the spell [monkey fish](spell/monkey_fish) to gain a swim speed of 10 feet). Such a creature can swim at one-quarter of its land speed instead, but it sacrifices the benefits of its swim speed on rounds when it isn't using its swim speed."

		"description": [
			"When a creature fails its Swim check by 5 or more, or when it doesn't spend any actions to swim (whether voluntarily or due to paralysis or similar conditions), it either sinks or rises based on its buoyancy. There are three normal states of buoyancy: sinking, rising, and neutral. If a creature's buoyancy is sinking, it naturally sinks; if its buoyancy is rising, it naturally rises to the surface; and if its buoyancy is neutral, it hangs in place unless it expends effort. Land-dwelling creatures generally have a sinking buoyancy unless they are carrying a substantial amount of low-density gear (like wooden items, at least until they become waterlogged) and little or no high-density gear (such as items made from metal or stone). [Air tanks](equipment/misc/air_tank) in particular make it much easier to change your buoyancy to rising. It's also possible to adjust an air tank to hold just enough air to achieve a neutral buoyancy-but once a creature has done so, if it picks up other objects or uses the tank to breathe underwater, it loses its neutral buoyancy until it readjusts (which may require returning to the surface to refill the air tank). In addition to these three normal states of buoyancy, there are two extreme states: swiftly sinking and swiftly rising. If a creature is swiftly sinking, it and its gear are so dense that it can walk on the bottom of the body of water, but it also needs to succeed at a DC 20 Swim check to swim towards the surface or to stay off the bottom. A creature carrying plenty of dense stone or metal items gains this buoyancy state. If a creature is swiftly rising, it needs to succeed at a DC 20 Swim check to submerge itself and stay submerged; a sizable air tank or other flotation device, or the help of magic, is needed to achieve this state.",
			"",
			"**Aquatic and Water Creatures:** Most naturally aquatic creatures (those with the aquatic subtype) have some form of air bladder or other organ that allows them to adjust their buoyancy on the fly, enabling them to maintain neutral buoyancy as a free action on their turn (unless they are carrying something large with particularly high or low density), and creatures with the water subtype naturally have the same buoyancy as water.",
			"",
			"**Buoyancy Speed:** A creature begins to sink or rise at the end of its turn the first time it badly fails (or does not attempt) a Swim check, moving up or down as appropriate at a speed of 10 feet; this speed increases by 10 feet each subsequent round unless the creature is stopped, to a maximum speed of 30 feet after 3 rounds. This movement provokes attacks of opportunity as normal. While sinking or rising because of its buoyancy, creatures are considered [off-balance](rule/off-balance_and_prone_underwater). Once per round, a creature sinking or rising because of its buoyancy can stop its momentum by succeeding at a Swim check as a move action. A creature that chooses to continue moving in the direction of its buoyancy under its own power, rather than through uncontrolled rising or sinking, can do so with a successful Swim check without needing to stop first. If a creature's buoyancy changes instantly while sinking or rising from buoyancy (such as via jettisoning something it's holding or using magic), its buoyancy speed adjusts by 10 feet in the new direction each round. A creature that fails the DC 20 Swim check to move against its buoyancy while swiftly sinking or swiftly rising moves 30 feet in the appropriate direction immediately.",
			"",
			"**Moving Against Buoyancy:** Much like flying upwards uses up twice as much of a flying creature's movement, each square of movement swimming in the opposite direction of a creature's buoyancy costs twice as much movement as normal (see [Thinking in Three Dimensions](rule/thinking_in_three_dimensions) for more details). Creatures with a neutral buoyancy ignore this hindrance.",
			"",
			"**Drag:** Sometimes, because a PC might want to alter her buoyancy (or simply because she wants to drag a particularly large piece of treasure back home), she might swim with an item that has significant surface area, like a giant treasure chest. In these cases, her speed is reduced by half (or more, at the GM's discretion). If the object is narrower in one dimension, like a pole, she can avoid drag by turning it so the narrow side faces the direction she wants to move; however, this adjustment requires a move action, so it slows her down if she needs to turn often."

			"While flying creatures can add a third dimension to land-based combat, such creatures are an exception rather than the rule. The main challenge three-dimensional adventuring presents is representing a creature's vertical position during combat. This challenge is tougher than usual because most flying in adventures still involves encounters relatively close to the ground, rather than in the open sky, but plenty of encounters in an underwater adventure may occur in open water, nowhere near the surface or bottom. Typical solutions for flying creatures like using stackable tokens or transparent dice boxes to elevate the flying creature all depend on the main map being a consistent bottom altitude, but in an underwater fight, the combatants could just as easily move farther down. One way to avoid physically representing the third dimension is to use your imagination instead of a battlemap, but given that it's even harder to keep track of all three dimensions in your head, it becomes difficult to keep accurate relative distances that way. Another simple way to handle it is to mark a creature's depth relative to its starting depth, either on a small token you move along with the creature or directly on the battle map. This solution doesn't involve as much work as creating a complicated three-dimensional representation of the battle, but it isn't always easy to judge the relative vertical position without looking at the numbers and thinking about them. In the end, use the solution that works best for you whether that's judging distances in your head or crafting elaborate physical representations.",
			"",
			"**Flanking:** All the usual rules for flanking still apply in three dimensions, but now there are far more ways for a target to potentially be flanked. It also means a larger number of weaker creatures can gang up on a stronger creature, since there are 26 valid spaces adjacent to a given square, rather than 8.",
			"",
			"**Flexible Movement:** In a normal adventure, particularly before magical flight becomes easily accessible, it's easier to predict a character's exact path. For instance, on land, to get to a cave in the woods, the characters have to walk through the woods, and they are likely to use a forest trail that allows them to move quickly, rather than heading off into the deep foliage. Particularly in a dungeon, denizens can place traps with the expectation that characters will step in very particular places, and in all likelihood, a character will do so. However, underwater, all bets are off. If the PCs need to get to a cave in a kelp forest, they can just swim over the kelp forest until they are directly above the cave and then swim down, barely spending any time in the kelp forest at all. Even in an underwater dungeon, unless both the ceiling and walls narrow to 5 feet (which could be a giveaway that the characters are being channeled into a trap), the characters have significant more leeway in where they move, which means that dungeon denizens should set proximity traps covering a wider radius, rather than depending on a particular square. The third dimension also makes it harder to blockade or patrol a perimeter, since there are so many more ways to slip past; essentially, defenders are patrolling along the surface of a sphere instead of the perimeter of a circle."

			"One of the most immediately noticeable differences when fighting underwater is that slashing and bludgeoning attacks are made with a -2 penalty and deal half damage, making piercing weapons the best bet for an underwater adventure. If you're off-balance (see [Off-Balance and Prone Underwater](rule/off-balance_and_prone_underwater)), your attacks with piercing weapons also take a -2 penalty and deal half damage. [Freedom of movement](spell/freedom_of_movement) can negate these penalties entirely and has [a variety of other effects](rule/freedom_of_movement). Additionally, [Aquadynamic Focus](feat/aquadynamic_focus) can specifically assist with this situation. Creatures with a natural swim speed from the aquatic or water subtype don't take these penalties with their inherent natural attacks. For instance, a kraken's bludgeoning tentacle attacks don't take penalties, but if it took the ectoplasmatist [spiritualist](class/spiritualist) archetype and gained two slashing ectoplasmic lash attacks, those would still take the penalties. Attacks that deal bludgeoning damage by pushing water, such as a [kineticist's](class/kineticist) water blast, also take no penalty and deal full damage underwater.",
			"",
			"**Ranged Attacks:** Traditional physical ranged weapon attacks underwater are much more challenging due to the increased drag from the water compared to air. Ranged attacks normally take a -2 penalty for every 5 feet of water, in addition to the normal penalty for range increments. The exceptions are the underwater light crossbow and underwater heavy crossbow, which ignore the penalty for ranged attacks underwater but have a significantly reduced range increment underwater. Thrown attacks don't usually work underwater at all, but if you can move directly above your opponent, you can throw a properly prepared piercing weapon (one made of stone, metal, or another particularly dense material) straight down, counting on its sinking buoyancy to propel it to its target. Hypothetically, you could do the reverse with a weapon of extremely low density, but achieving such a low density while still having a shape that allows for throwing and enough mass to damage would generally require an unusual material or magical assistance. At the end of a downward-thrown object's maximum range, it continues to sink, but its trajectory is far too unpredictable to hit anything with its dangerous end.",
			"",
			"**Combat Maneuvers:** Most combat maneuvers work underwater, although you take a -2 penalty on grapple combat maneuver checks if you don't have a Swim speed (a successful damage action taken as part of a maintained grapple deals full damage, even if your unarmed strike deals bludgeoning damage). Even tripping is possible underwater with [special rules](rule/off-balance_and_prone_underwater).",
			"",
			"**Cover from the Surface:** Due to water's surface tension, creatures attempting to attack through water's surface count its surface as total cover (if a creature is partially submerged, it gains proportionally less cover); this applies even to spells that require attack rolls. The exception to this rule is attacks that deal piercing damage-these can penetrate the water's surface but take a -2 penalty to do so. This is a change from the rule on cover from the water's surface in the Core Rulebook, but it allows actions like spearfishing and firing harpoons from whaling ships."

			"\"Off-balance\" is a special state (though not technically a condition) that is listed in the [Combat Adjustments Underwater table](rule/underwater_combat). A creature off-balance in the water loses its Dexterity bonus to AC, its opponents gain a +2 bonus on attack rolls against it, and attacks it makes with piercing weapons are made at a -2 penalty and deal half damage. A creature typically becomes off-balance by failing a Swim check, which makes it off-balance for a round, even if it has a neutral buoyancy and doesn't sink or rise.",
			"",
			"**Tripping Underwater:** While flying creatures specifically can't be tripped, the Core Rulebook doesn't specify whether the same is true of swimming creatures. Being prone doesn't mean much for a swimming creature, so instead, a successful trip against a swimming creature forces that creature to attempt a Swim check at a DC equal to the result of the combat maneuver check to trip; failing the Swim check causes the creature to become off-balance. Many aquatic creatures can't be tripped or have a high Swim bonus and thus can always take 10, so this tactic isn't always effective, but when it is, it can make dexterous foes much easier to hit. However, being off-balance doesn't affect most of the target's attack rolls, and the target can regain its balance simply by succeeding at a Swim check to move on its next turn as normal."

			"In addition to preventing a character from being grappled and several other nasty conditions, [freedom of movement](spell/freedom_of_movement) enables the target to move and attack normally while underwater. Thus, a creature benefitting from freedom of movement can swing weapons without penalties (though objects that leave its possession, like thrown weapons or ammo from ranged weapons, lose this benefit), lift objects without drag, and walk along the bottom at full speed. The creature automatically succeeds at all Swim checks as the water offers no significant resistance to its movement.

			"While various spells have different effects underwater, the most fundamental hindrance to spellcasting, at least at low levels, is the fact that a creature holding its breath must succeed at a concentration check (DC = 15 + spell level) to cast a spell at all, whether or not the spell has a verbal component. If the spell has a verbal component, expelling the air needed to incant the spell reduces the creature's remaining number of rounds of breath by 3 (which stacks with the reduction from performing a standard or full-round action; see the [Drowning section](rule/drowning_aa).), and a creature can't finish the spell if it doesn't have enough breath left. Spells that have verbal components and casting times of swift or immediate actions instead decrease the caster's remaining number of rounds of breath by 1. Mundane spell components generally work fine underwater as long as they're stored in watertight containers, and aquatic-appropriate substitutions exist for any mundane component that would be inherently impossible to use underwater. The Core Rulebook describes the effect of fire spells underwater; some other spells exist that function differently.",
			"",
			"**Acid Spells:** Conjuration (creation) spells that conjure nonmagical acid, like [acid arrow](spell/acid_arrow), don't work properly underwater, as the water dilutes the acid harmlessly. Evocation spells that deal magical acid damage, like a [fireball](spell/fireball) affected by the [Elemental Spell](feat/elemental_spell) metamagic feat, work normally underwater.",
			"",
			"**Cloud and Weather Spells:** Cloud spells such as [fog cloud](spell/fog_cloud) and [obscuring mist](spell/obscuring_mist) specifically say that they don't work underwater, though the [Murky Spell](feat/murky_spell) metamagic feat can create equivalent mist spells underwater. Other spells that create weather that would be appropriate only on land, like [ice storm](spell/ice_storm) and [sleet storm](spell/sleet_storm), do not function underwater at all. [Twilight haze](spell/twilight_haze), however, is an illusion and thus works underwater.",
			"",
			"**Cold Spells:** Spells that deal cold damage but don't normally conjure ice, like [cone of cold](spell/cone_of_cold), instead deal half cold damage and half piercing damage, as the cold creates jagged ice shards underwater. This has no effect on spells that already create ice, rather than just cold damage.",
			"",
			"**Electricity Spells:** While normal electricity, such as that from a natural thunderstorm, tends to disperse in all directions underwater, magical electricity spells hold their integrity enough to have normal effects underwater, with one exception: visible and audible lightning bolts and sparks are the result of combusted air, and they don't happen underwater. Because of this, creatures that fail to identify an electricity spell that requires a ranged touch attack are flat-footed against the first such ranged touch attack during a fight, as they don't realize they need to dodge the invisible projectile (unless they otherwise have reason to expect it, like a spellcaster who can cast such spells). This doesn't apply to melee touch spells like [shocking grasp](spell/shocking_grasp), since the creature can still see the spellcaster's hand moving towards it.",
			"",
			"**Fire Spells:** While normal fire (including alchemist's fire) and most supernatural fire can't burn underwater at all, fire spells have a chance to transform into steam instead. Whenever you cast a fire spell underwater, you must succeed at a caster level check (DC = 20 + the spell's level) in order to channel the heat into the water and create steam, dealing the same amount of fire damage as normal but without secondary effects of fire, like igniting combustibles. A fire spell must be either entirely steam or entirely fire, which means that if it covers an area that would normally extend beyond the water's surface, you must choose whether to affect the region above the water or below, and the surface blocks line of effect for the rest of the spell. A spell or spell-like ability with the fire descriptor that already creates steam (like a [kineticist's](class/kineticist) steam blast) doesn't require the caster level check to create steam; only spells that would normally create an actual fire require the check. The [Steam Spell](spell/steam_spell) metamagic feat makes it easier to cast fire spells underwater.",
			"",
			"**Invisibility:** Underwater, an invisible creature still displaces water, making it possible to spot and target it as if it had only concealment, as per the description of [invisibility](spell/invisibility). The [invisibility bubble](spell/invisibility_bubble) spells hide the displaced water and thus allow effective invisibility underwater.",
			"",
			"**Sonic Spells:** While sound travels four times faster and farther in water than air, it also takes more energy to do so, so in the end sonic spells have the same results underwater as they do on land. At the GM's discretion, a spellcaster can choose to instead double the range or area, halve the damage, and decrease the DC by 2 for sonic attacks."

			"Drowning is one of the most obvious dangers of underwater adventuring. As creature can typically hold its breath for a number of rounds equal to twice its Constitution score. Whenever a creature takes a standard or full-round action, it expends 1 additional round of breath, so practically speaking, if a creature wants to fight or double move each round, it can do so only for a number of rounds equal to its Constitution score. Intentionally exhaling breath expends 1 to 3 rounds for each exhaling action-generally 1 round for a small exhalation, and 3 rounds for an extended exhalation like singing a song or casting a spell. Certain magic, like the suffocation spell from the Advanced Player's Guide, can expel all of a creature's held breath.",
			"",
			"Once a creature has used up these rounds of safety, it lives on a knife's edge between life and death. Each round, the creature must succeed at a Constitution check, with a DC starting at 10 and increasing by 1 each round after the first. Once it fails this check, the creature begins to drown, falling unconscious (and dropping to 0 hit points if it currently had more), dropping to -1 hit points on the next round, and dying on the round after that. At any point, if the creature becomes able to breathe (perhaps because someone dragged it out of the water or cast a spell to assist it), it ceases drowning but doesn't regain any lost hit points. Note that if a creature holds its breath in a situation where it could normally breathe, it won't fall unconscious if it fails its Constitution check.",
			"",
			"Because of the prohibitive limitations of holding one's breath, underwater explorers from the surface use a variety of techniques to extend their ability to breathe underwater. The most common is [water breathing](spell/water_breathing), which is extremely long-lasting and can protect an entire group with one casting. A simpler, short-term solution is [air bubble](spell/air_bubble), which can protect a single creature for a few minutes-but not usually enough for an underwater adventure. The most powerful option is [life bubble](spell/life_bubble); while its duration is half that of water breathing, it also protects against many other underwater hazards such as extreme temperature and pressure. Those who prefer a mundane alternative to ephemeral (and dispellable) magic tend to use [air tanks](equipment/misc/air_tank) to store additional air, but characters hoping to stay underwater find that carrying around more than a few extra breaths of air sets their buoyancy to swiftly rising, almost like wearing a giant life preserver, so this solution is effective only for a strong swimmer or someone with access to magic to alter buoyancy."

			"The ocean is divided into four zones: the sunlight zone (from the surface to 600 feet below), the twilight zone (from 600 feet down to 3,300 feet), the midnight zone (from 3,300 feet down to 13,000 feet-which often reaches the bottom), and the Abyssal zone (from 13,000 feet to the bottom in depths greater than 13,000 feet). Some oceanographers add a fifth zone, the Abaddonian zone, which describes areas 20,000 feet and below in the deepest ocean trenches.",
			"",
			"**Pressure:** Most aquatic creatures have adapted to depths corresponding roughly to one or more of these zones in particular, and ignore pressure damage while within their native depth range unless they instantaneously transport from one depth to another, as with [dimension door](spell/dimension_door). [Pressure damage rules are found here.](rule/water_dangers) Surface creatures, on the other hand, treat depths of 0 to 100 feet as their native zone. For every minute spent below their native zone, a creature must succeed at a Fortitude save or take 1d6 points of damage, plus an additional 1d6 points of damage for every additional 100 feet beyond the first. The DC is initially 15, and it increases by 1 for every minute after the first. After five successful Fortitude saves (consecutive or not), the creature adapts to the pressure. If a creature is within its native depth range but experiencing pressure dangers due to instantaneous travel, this adaptation to the new pressure happens [all at once](rule/adapting_to_aquatic_adventures). If the creature is outside its native range, this adaptation adjusts its native range down or up by 100 feet, as appropriate. A surface dweller swimming downward may adapt to the new depth, but will then experience pressure hazards when it ascends back to the surface.",
			"",
			"For instance, if Valeros swims down 220 feet, he is 120 feet outside his native range of 0 to 100 feet, so he needs to attempt a Fortitude save every minute to avoid taking 2d6 points of damage. If he succeeds at five Fortitude saves, his native range shifts to 100-200 feet, and he must attempt Fortitude saves to avoid taking 1d6 points of damage each minute. After five more successful Fortitude saves, his native range is now 200-300 feet, and he takes no further damage from pressure, but if he ascends back to the surface, he must resume attempting Fortitude saves to avoid taking 2d6 points of damage from the reversing pressure. Because of the dangers of changing pressure, aquatic explorers find it safest to adjust their depth gradually unless they have special means of avoiding pressure hazards. Spells like [freedom of movement](spell/freedom_of_movement) and [life bubble](spell/life_bubble) prevent pressure damage. [Pressure adaptation](spell/pressure_adaptation) and [stabilize pressure](spell/stabilize_pressure) are more focused and lower-level options.",
			"",
			"**Temperature:** Immersion in water can cause hypothermia in land-dwelling creatures at temperatures that would normally be perfectly safe on land. Generally, creatures in water that is 80&deg; F or higher are safe from hypothermia. Water from 60&deg; to 80&deg; F is equivalent to cold weather (a creature must succeed at a Fortitude save each hour to avoid taking 1d6 points of nonlethal cold damage; [see here](rule/cold_dangers) for information on determining the DC). Water from 40&deg; to 60&deg; F functions like severe cold (a creature must succeed at a Fortitude save every 10 minutes to avoid taking 1d6 points of nonlethal cold damage). Water from 32&deg; to 40&deg; F acts as extreme cold (dealing an automatic 1d6 points of lethal cold damage each minute). Water below 32&deg; F (which is generally possible only in areas with high levels of salt) deals an automatic 2d6 points of lethal cold damage per minute. Sea creatures are adapted to the water temperature in their native zones. The [endure elements](spell/endure_elements) spell protects its target from water as cold as 32&deg; F (rather than -50&deg; F in air), which is generally enough to cover temperature extremes in the ocean. By contrast, water rarely becomes warm enough to provide heat dangers except in the presence of a hazard like a hydrothermal vent, as even the most extreme temperatures in the sunlight zone tend to cap at around 104&deg; F.",
			"",
			"**Sunlight Zone:** The sunlight zone contains all aquatic plants that require light for photosynthesis, so it's home to both phytoplankton and seaweed. It's also the home of most marine mammals, many sharks, some jellyfish, and most of the fish familiar to fisherfolk. The visibility estimates in the [Perception](skill/perception) rules assume sufficient light levels (or a means of seeing in the dark), which are typically present only in the sunlight zone. The water temperature in the sunlight zone varies based on the surface conditions, anywhere from over 100&deg; F to below 30&deg; F.",
			"",
			"**Twilight Zone:** In the twilight zone, only about 1% of the light from the surface remains-not enough for photosynthesis. This also isn't enough light for a creature with normal vision to see, but creatures with low-light vision can still see to a distance of around 60 feet as though in dim light. Many creatures living in this zone either have darkvision or rely on precise senses other than sight to guide them, while others are bioluminescent. Roughly 90% of Golarion's fish live in this zone. The temperature in the twilight zone ranges from about 68&deg; F at the top to around 39&deg; F at the bottom, with very few variations at any given depth.",
			"",
			"**Midnight Zone:** The midnight zone has no light whatsoever from the surface, requiring darkvision or nonvisual senses for any creature that doesn't have its own source of light. Fueled by the detritus that sinks from above, many types of squids and octopuses and some krakens live in this zone, along with some large whales and other creatures of the deep, but it's harder for fish to survive here. The temperature in the midnight zone is generally 39&deg; F throughout. The midnight zone usually extends to the bottom.",
			"",
			"**Abyssal Zone:** In regions where the ocean floor is more than 13,000 feet below the surface, the Abyssal zone lurks beneath the midnight zone, a region that's dark and cold even compared to the midnight zone, and devoid of even the falling detritus scavenged by midnight zone denizens. Named for the Abyss, this zone contains unnatural and horrific creatures mixed in with other fauna. Giant squids, krakens, and other tentacled horrors thrive in this zone, despite the 35&deg; to 39&deg; F temperature. Other creatures congregate around the warmth of the zone's hydrothermal vents, gaining nourishment from the vents' expulsions.",
			"",
			"**Abaddonian Zone:** Some scholars, particularly among deep-sea races, utter dark whispers of a fifth and final zone that exists only in the depths of the deepest ocean trenches, over 20,000 feet below the water's surface. Supposedly, pressures over 1,000 times that of the surface world, combined with low temperatures and ambient magic, create within these trenches a nightmarish tableau that hardly seems it could exist on the Material Plane. Amorphous creatures like jellyfish, sea cucumbers, and tube worms cling to life in this inhospitable environment, eking out a life amidst beings of unfathomable malevolence. While scholars have funded expeditions to gather information on the Abaddonian zone, there are few, if any, survivors to give their accounts of those expeditions, and certainly none who remained sane."

			"Currents in the ocean (or a similarly large body of water) work similarly to rivers. Each current has a particular speed (measured in feet per round), width, and direction, and at the beginning of a creature's turn, the current pushes it that distance. This movement provokes attacks of opportunity to creatures not in the same current. A creature can try to swim against the current's flow on its turn to stay in place, but it's usually a better idea to swim perpendicular to the current to reach the edge and exit the current. Fortunately, while rivers can reach speeds up to 90 feet per round, the fastest natural ocean currents are usually not much faster than 50 feet per round in the sunlight zone, and are slower the deeper one travels. This is because currents are mainly influenced by the weather near the surface and tiny discrepancies in temperature far below the surface, and the effects of the latter are not as strong. Currents always count as at least rough water (Swim DC 15), and faster currents count as at least stormy water (Swim DC 20).",
			"",
			"The majority of the ocean does not count as running water, but currents do. Thus while the spell [locate creature](spell/locate_creature) functions underwater, it rarely extends to its full range, since even an extremely slow current blocks the spell. Likewise, vampires tempt fate in the ocean by exposing themselves to the risk of an unexpected current."

		"sources": [ "Aquatic Adventures" ],
		"description": [
			"When currents flowing in opposite directions meet, they create a whirlpool. Most whirlpools are harmless, but some mighty maelstroms formed by powerful tides are capable of great destruction. The most powerful whirlpools can reach a maximum current speed of around 200 feet per round, spinning in a circle and generating a centripetal force to pull nearby creatures and objects into the whirlpool and prevent those caught in the whirlpool from leaving. Whirlpool movement doesn't normally provoke attacks of opportunity, because no one caught in the current is in a position to make one. Conditions are so rough in maelstroms that Swim checks reach DC 40 or higher. Creatures caught in a whirlpool take 1d6 points of bludgeoning damage per round for every 50 feet of the whirlpool's speed. Sometimes the only way to survive a whirlpool is to reach the center, since-unlike when a water elemental creates and controls a whirlpool with mischief in mind-a natural whirlpool eventually drags its captives to the bottom and out."
