			"**Prerequisites:** Base attack bonus +1.  ",
			"**Benefit:** You can use any equipment trick related to the chosen item as long as you meet the trick's prerequisites. If the item would normally be considered an improvised weapon, you can treat it as either a normal weapon or an improvised weapon, depending on which is more beneficial for you.  ",
			"**Special:** You can gain Equipment Trick multiple times. Each time you take the feat, it applies to a new type of equipment.",

			"In addition to the feat or skill requirements listed for each of these tricks, you must have the Equipment Trick (anvil) feat. You may use these tricks with any anvil weighing 50 pounds or more.",
			"",
			"*Counterweight* (Climb 5 ranks): You can use your anvil as a counterweight when you climb a rope or chain to reduce your Climb DC by 5.",
			"",
			"*Improve Armor* (Craft [armor] 5 ranks): You can spend an hour with your anvil and a suit of nonmagical metal armor to temporarily increase the armor's armor bonus by 1. This bonus ends after the next time the wearer is hit.",
			"",
			"*Quick Fix* (Craft [any] 5 ranks): You can spend 1 minute with your anvil and a metal item with the broken condition to remove the broken condition from the item for 1 hour. The item does not recover any hit points, and at the end of the hour it regains the broken condition and loses an additional 1d6 hit points (unless properly fixed by then).",
			"",
			"*Smash Through* (Improved Bull Rush): When you end your move adjacent to a closed door, you can open the door as part of your move action (instead of as a separate move action) by smashing it with an anvil as you move. If the door is stuck or locked, you must succeed at a bull rush combat maneuver check that exceeds the door's break DC.",

			"### Boot Tricks",
			"",
			"**Source** [Dirty Tactics Toolbox pg. 18](source/dirty_tactics_toolbox)",
			"",
			"In addition to the feat or skill prerequisites (listed in parentheses) for each of the following tricks, you must have the appropriate Equipment Trick feat.",
			"",
			"A pair of boots refers to any set of footwear that has hard soles. These equipment tricks can be used with either magic or mundane boots.",
			"",
			"*Cleat Stomp* (Improved Unarmed Strike): When you make a successful unarmed strike against an opponent while wearing a pair of boots with cleats, the target takes 1 point of bleed damage. The bleed damage can be stopped by a successful DC 15 Heal skill check or by magical healing. The effects of this trick stack with other sources of bleed damage but not with other bleed damage dealt by this trick.",
			"",
			"*Heel Crush* (Improved Dirty Trick): When you succeed at a successful dirty trick combat maneuver check against an opponent within melee range, you can crush the target's foot or similar appendage with your boot heel. Instead of inflicting one of the conditions that can normally be imposed by a dirty trick, you reduce the target's movement speed by half (to a minimum of 5 feet). You can't use a dirty trick combat maneuver in this manner against an opponent that is using a movement type other than its land speed, and movement types other than land speeds aren't affected by this equipment trick. As usual, a creature with a movement speed of 5 feet can't take a 5-foot step.",
			"",
			"*Sharp Veer* (Combat Reflexes): Whenever you use the charge or run action, you can make one 90-degree turn during your movement. You must move at least 10 feet in a straight line after this turn if you are charging.",

			"",
			"*Dazzling Trail* (Dazzling Display): When you successfully use Intimidate to demoralize an opponent while wearing a cloak, you can increase the duration of the demoralize effect by 1d4 rounds.",
			"",
			"*Distracting Cloak* (Stealth 3 ranks): When you attempt a Bluff check to feint, you can use your cape to create a diversion instead of denying your opponent his Dexterity bonus to AC. Compare the result of your Bluff check against the feint DC of each opponent that can see you (DC = 10 + the opponent's base attack bonus + the opponent's Wisdom modifier, or 10 + the opponent's Sense Motive bonus if he is trained in Sense Motive and this bonus is higher). You can attempt a Stealth check to hide from any opponent that you successfully feint against in this manner, even if that opponent is observing you. If you do not have cover or concealment against any of these targets at the start of each of their turns, they automatically spot you at that time.",
			"",
			"*Parachute Cloak* (Acrobatics 5 ranks): While wearing a cloak, you can adjust your grip so that it catches the air as you fall. If you use both of your hands to hold on to your cloak as you fall, you can attempt a DC 20 Acrobatics check to ignore the first 20 feet fallen (as opposed to the usual DC 15 check to ignore only the first 10 feet), and you avoid falling prone at the end of your jump even if you take damage.",
			"",
			"*Suerte de Capote* (Dueling Cape): While using the Dueling Cape feat to wield a cloak or similar object as a buckler, you gain a +2 bonus on Bluff checks to feint in combat. This bonus increases by 1 for every 5 ranks in Sleight of Hand that you possess. Additionally, you can release your cape as a free action whenever you successfully feint an opponent with a melee attack to entangle it, as detailed in the Dueling Cape feat.",

			"",
			"In addition to the feat, skill, or other requirement listed for each of these tricks, you must have the Equipment Trick (heavy blade scabbard) feat to use a trick. You may use these tricks with any sword scabbard designed for a heavy blade (see the [fighter weapon groups](ability/weapon_groups)). At your GM's discretion, you may be able to use some of these tricks with a scabbard intended for a light blade, but that requires a separate Equipment Trick feat and may be less effective.",
			"",
			"*Capture Weapon* (Improved Disarm): When you successfully disarm an opponent's manufactured weapon, as a free action you may flip the disarmed weapon into your scabbard so long as the weapon would fit there. If you are not holding the scabbard in hand and attempt this, you have a -4 penalty on the disarm check. At the GM's discretion, you can also use this trick on any item the opponent is holding as long as it would fit in your scabbard (such as a wand). You can only use this trick if you are wearing or holding your empty scabbard.",
			"",
			"*Find the Hidden* (Blind-Fight): You can use your scabbard to probe for hidden dangers. As a move action, you may sweep your scabbard through an adjacent square where you suspect there is an invisible creature; make a touch attack and roll the miss chance normally. If it hits and you have an available attack, you may attack that target once with a -2 penalty and no miss chance for invisibility. All other attacks you make against that creature (whether in that round or otherwise) do not gain this benefit (though you can sweep again on your next turn).",
			"",
			"*Grab Purchase* (Climb 5 ranks): You can use your scabbard as leverage to halt a fall, keep yourself from getting dragged, or prevent other sorts of involuntary movement by grabbing your scabbard with a free hand, jamming it into a hard surface, and clinging to it. Whenever you fail a Climb check, you may attempt to catch yourself while falling with a +10 bonus; your GM may rule that some walls require you to hold your scabbard with two hands rather than one or are too smooth for this trick to work. If subjected to involuntary movement such as a bull rush, you may spend a move action from your next turn to use your scabbard as an anchor, giving you a +5 bonus to your CMD to resist the movement. If you spend this move action, you only get a standard action during your next turn.",
			"",
			"*Hurl Scabbard* (Quick Draw): You can draw your weapon in such a way that you send your combat scabbard whirling off to strike at any creature in sight. This ranged attack is a swift action and is treated as a thrown weapon.",
			"",
			"*Steer Opponent* (Improved Bull Rush): You can use your scabbard to move a foe into the perfect position for you to make your attack. As a swift action, use your scabbard to make a bull rush against an opponent. If you succeed, instead of pushing him back, you direct your target into the path of your next attack. You gain a +2 bonus on your next attack roll against the target, and +1 for every additional 5 feet your bull rush could have pushed your opponent if you had chosen to push him back. If you fail the bull rush attempt, you are considered flat-footed against that target until your next turn.",
			"",
			"*Tangle Leg* (Improved Trip, Throw Anything): When you draw your weapon, you may send its combat scabbard whirling off to strike an opponent's legs. This bonus attack is a swift action and requires you to make a trip attack against the target. The target can be no larger than your own size category, and the range penalty applies to your trip attempt. If you succeed, the target is knocked prone. Failing this attempt does not knock you prone unless you are within your opponent's reach.",

			"### Instrument Tricks",
			"",
			"**Source** [Adventurer's Armory 2 pg. 19](source/adventurer's_armory_2)",
			"",
			"Bards and other musicians must sometimes improvise more than their music. These instrument tricks expand any musical instrument's uses and supplement the [Equipment Trick](feat/equipment_trick) feat. Some tricks might be unusable for certain instruments at the GM's discretion; for example, an organ is too unwieldy to use as an improvised weapon. In addition to the feat, skill, or other requirements listed for each of these tricks, you must have the Equipment Trick (instrument) feat to use a trick.",
			"",
			"*Attention Grabber* (Perform 5 ranks, Bluff 5 ranks or bardic performance or raging song class feature): Your loud or discordant performance covers your allies' movements. Creatures within 30 feet of you that can hear you play an instrument take a -2 penalty on Perception checks, other than Perception checks made in response to your actions, for as long as you play.",
			"",
			"*Goad Animal* (Handle Animal 5 ranks or Animal Affinity): You can use your soothing performance to handle an animal that is friendly toward you, such as a mount or pet. When playing your instrument, commanding the animal to perform a trick it knows is a free action, and pushing it to perform a trick it does not know is a standard action. If you already can make an animal respond more quickly, such as with the link ability of an animal companion, this trick provides no benefit.",
			"",
			"*Jaw-Dropping Distraction* (Perform 7 ranks, Bluff 7 ranks or bardic performance or raging song class feature): When using your instrument, you can attempt a Perform check instead of a Bluff check to feint an opponent. If you succeed, the creature is denied its Dexterity bonus to AC against one target of your choosing (other than you) until the beginning of your next turn. Once you have used this trick against a creature, whether or not you succeeded at the check, you cannot use this trick to feint the creature for 24 hours. Creatures with uncanny dodge are immune to this trick.",
			"",
			"*Play to the Crowd* (Perform 3 ranks, Diplomacy 3 ranks or bardic performance or raging song class feature): You can use Perform, rather than Diplomacy, to improve an NPC's initial attitude toward you as long as you are able to perform for at least 1 minute. You cannot use this trick to increase the NPC's attitude beyond friendly.",
			"",
			"*Ruffian's Riff* (Catch Off-Guard): You can treat a musical instrument as an improvised weapon with the performance special feature. When you use a masterwork musical instrument as an improvised weapon, you treat it as a masterwork weapon (adding a +1 enhancement bonus on your attack rolls). Your attacks with a magical musical instrument are treated as magic for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.",

			"",
			"**Source** [Sargava, the Lost Colony pg. 25](source/sargava,_the_lost_colony)",
			"",
			"In addition to the feat, skill, or other requirement listed for each of these tricks, you normally must have the Equipment Trick (Kaava musk) feat to use a trick. You can, however, attempt Kaava musk tricks marked with an asterisk without the Equipment Trick (Kaava musk) feat, but you have a 50% chance of splashing yourself with the musk instead of completing the trick; this failure uses the dose of the musk (and in most cases invalidates what you were planning to use the musk for).",
			"",
			"*Careful Steps* (Nimble Moves or Acrobatics 5 ranks): You can pass through a square splashed with Kaava musk without getting any of it on you.",
			"",
			"*Fast Flask* (Quick Draw): You can draw an easily accessible flask of Kaava musk as a free action rather than a standard action.",
			"",
			"*Make the Kill* (scent ability or scent rage power): You gain a +1 morale bonus on weapon attack and weapon damage rolls when attacking a target marked with Kaava musk.",
			"",
			"*Musk Blinding* (Blinding Critical): When using Kaava musk as a thrown weapon, increase the Fortitude save DC of the blinding critical effect by +5.",
			"",
			"*Musk Poison* (poison use class ability): You can apply Kaava musk to a melee or thrown weapon as if it were a poison. This makes your weapon reek in the normal manner. However, the first creature struck by your weapon also gains the musk-stink as if it were splashed by a full container of musk 2 days ago. The struck target can wash off the musk on the next round in the normal manner, but otherwise it continues to stink for 2 more days. Kaava musk applied to small items like ammunition has no effect.",
			"",
			"*Musk Sickening* (Sickening Critical): When using Kaava musk as a thrown weapon, increase the duration of the sickening critical effect by 1 minute.",
			"",
			"*Reactive Splashing* (Improved Disarm): When disarming an opponent of a flask of Kaava musk, you can have the flask break at your opponent's feet, automatically splashing him with the musk.",
			"",
			"*Splashproof Shield* (Shield Focus): If you are using a shield and are hit with Kaava musk, you can make a Reflex save to use the shield to prevent any of the musk from touching you (thus, if you drop the shield, you do not have any of the musk penalties). The DC for this ability is 10 if using a tower shield, 15 for a heavy shield, 20 for a light shield, and 25 for a buckler. You cannot use this trick if you are flat-footed or helpless.",
			"",
			"*Stink-Fighting* (Blind-Fight): Your familiarity with Kaava musk allows you to pinpoint an invisible muskmarked creature with a Perception check at only a -10 penalty rather than the normal -20 penalty.",

In addition to the feat, skill, or other requirements listed for each of these tricks, you must have the Equipment Trick (lantern) feat to use a trick.",
			"",
			"*Intensified Oil* (Craft [alchemy] 3 ranks): You can combine three flasks of oil into a single use of improved oil as you add it to a lamp or lantern. This improved oil causes the lamp or lantern to which it is added to burn more brightly than usual, increasing its light range by 50%. This improved oil can only be used in the lamp or lantern it's mixed in and has no additional special effects.",
			"",
			"*Lantern Bash* (Shield Focus): If you carry a lamp or lantern in the hand you use to wield a light shield, your shield bash attacks with that shield deal an additional 1 point of fire damage.",
			"",
			"*Lantern Bomb* (Quick Draw): You can throw a lamp or lantern with at least 4 hours of oil remaining in it as a splash weapon, using the rules for alchemist's fire.",
			"",
			"*Lesser Light* (no additional prerequisites): When lighting a lamp or lantern, you reduce the size of its flame to provide only dim light in the area in which the lantern usually provides normal light. The lamp or lantern uses oil at half the usual rate. The lamp or lantern must be extinguished and re-lit to shed light normally.",
			"",
			"*Oil Splash* (Improved Dirty Trick): You can attempt a dirty trick combat maneuver against an opponent while either you or the opponent is holding a lamp or lantern. If you succeed at this combat maneuver check, you can knock some oil from the lamp or lantern into your target's face. Your target is blinded as normal by the dirty trick and takes 1 point of fire damage each round the blindness lasts.",
			"",
			"### Pole Tricks",
			"",
			"**Source** [Adventurer's Armory 2 pg. 15](source/adventurer's_armory_2)",
			"",
			"Each of these tricks can be done with a pole or balancing pole, but specific poles have further abilities. In addition to the feat, skill, or other requirements listed for each of these tricks, you must have the Equipment Trick (pole) feat to use a trick.",
			"",
			"*Pole Trip* (Catch Off-Guard or Improved Trip): You can treat a pole as an improvised weapon with the reach and trip special features. You can treat an unhinged folding pole as an improvised weapon with the disarm and trip special features. A pole or folding pole used as an improvised weapon deals 1d6 points of bludgeoning damage.",
			"",
			"*Seek the Unseen* (Perception 1 rank): When you attempt to find a creature you cannot see (either because it is invisible, or because you are blind), you can sweep a pole through any two adjacent squares within 10 feet of you as a standard action. Make a melee attack against an AC of 10. If you hit, and if a creature you cannot see is in the designated area, you deal no damage but have successfully pinpointed the creature's current location.",
			"",
			"*Wall Climb* (Climb 3 ranks): You can climb narrow passageways if your pole can reach a wall or other solid surface on both sides, bracing yourself and scooting the pole further along the surface as you climb. This method is reliable but laborious; you gain a +10 circumstance bonus on your Climb checks to climb in this manner, but you climb at half the usual speed.",

			"",
			"In addition to the feat, skill, or other requirement listed for each of these tricks, you must have the Equipment Trick (rope) feat to use rope tricks. Rope tricks can be performed with hemp rope or silk rope, or with similar ropelike items at the GM's discretion.",
			"",
			"*Coil* (Sleight of Hand 5 ranks): You can coil rope rapidly, requiring only 1 round to coil 20 feet of rope. (Coiling 20 feet of rope normally takes 1d6 rounds.)",
			"",
			"*Hogtie* (Improved Grapple): When you attempt to tie up an opponent you are grappling, your penalty is only -5 instead of the normal -10.",
			"",
			"*Knotted Weapon* (Weapon Proficiency [spiked chain]): You can use a knotted length of rope as a spiked chain that inflicts bludgeoning damage instead of piercing damage.",
			"",
			"*Lash* (Weapon Proficiency [whip]): You can use a length of rope as a whip at no penalty. The piece of rope that is used as a whip must be 10 feet long-length in excess of this must remain coiled or otherwise unused at your feet or side.",
			"",
			"*Lifeline* (Climb 5 ranks): When you or a nearby creature is falling (from a failed Climb check or otherwise), you can throw a held rope as an immediate action, maintaining a grip on one end. If you are falling, this is treated as an attempt to catch yourself while falling made with a +10 bonus, but there must be some sort of solid anchor available for your rope to loop around. When attempting this check on another creature, treat it as if you yourself were falling. If the weight of the creature exceeds twice your heavy load limit (your own equipment does not count against this maximum), you are pulled after it.",
			"",
			"*Quick Release* (no additional prerequisites): You can secure a rope such that you can loose it from either end by making a quick series of tugs (a move action) at any point along the rope's length.",
			"",
			"*Slip Away* (Escape Artist 5 ranks): You gain a +10 bonus on Escape Artist checks to escape from ropes and ropelike restraints (such as vines).",
			"",
			"*Tangle* (Throw Anything): You can throw a coiled length of rope as a ranged weapon. If you hit with a ranged touch attack, the target becomes entangled. It can cut or burst the rope, or escape with a DC 15 Escape Artist check. The rope must be unsecured to use this trick.",

			"",
			"In addition to the feat, skill, or other requirement listed for each of these tricks, you must have the Equipment Trick (shield) feat and proficiency in (non-tower) shields to use a trick. You may use these tricks with any light or heavy shield. At your GM's discretion, you may be able to use some of these tricks with a tower shield or buckler, but that requires a separate Equipment Trick feat for that kind of shield and may add a penalty on the associated roll.",
			"",
			"*Break Ground* (Improved Trip, Throw Anything): In place of a melee attack, you can throw your shield at an opponent's feet, interfering with his movement and perhaps tripping him. You must be holding (not wearing) your shield or using a throwing shield to use this trick. Make a trip attack against your opponent. The opponent can be no larger than your own size category, and the range penalty applies to your trip attempt. If you succeed, the target is knocked prone. Failing this attempt does not knock you prone unless you are within your opponent's reach. Whether or not you succeed, as long as your shield remains where you threw it, the opponent treats that square as difficult terrain until he moves out of the square.",
			"",
			"*Hurl Shield* (Throw Anything): You can throw your shield as a ranged improvised weapon. You must be holding (not wearing) your shield to perform this trick. If you are using a throwing shield, there is no reason to use this trick.",
			"",
			"*Little Wall* (Escape Artist 5 ranks): You can contort your body behind your shield in order to gain a brief moment of security. Whenever you use the total defense action, you may choose to gain cover instead of the normal dodge bonus to AC.",
			"",
			"*Keen Eye* (Perception 5 ranks): You have mastered the art of using the reflective surface of your shield to locate foes that you dare not look at directly. On your turn, you may choose to forfeit your shield's AC bonus for 1 round to improve your defenses against one creature using a gaze attack. Your chance to avoid having to make a saving throw against that creature's gaze attack increases to 100%, and the creature does not gain concealment against you. For every 5 ranks in Perception you have above 5, you may simultaneously use this ability against another creature with a gaze attack.",
			"",
			"*Release Shield* (no prerequisites): You may remove a light or heavy shield as a swift action instead of a move action. You may remove a throwing shield as a free action. Once you've removed the shield, you may hold it in one hand or drop it as a free action.",
			"",
			"*Ricochet Shield* (Deadly Aim, Throw Anything): When you throw a shield, you can bounce it off one or more hard surfaces in order to strike a target from an unexpected angle or to bypass an obstacle such as cover. Each object you ricochet your shield off of imposes a -2 penalty on the attack roll. Range increments apply for the total distance the shield travels, not just the direct distance between you and the target.",
			"",
			"*Shield Gag* (Improved Grapple, Throw Anything): You can force your shield into the mouth of a creature to prevent it from using bite attacks or other mouthbased abilities. Make a grapple check against a creature at least two sizes larger than your size category. If you succeed, you wedge your shield into its mouth. At any time you may release your shield, which means you both lose the grappled condition, though your shield remains in its mouth. The creature may remove the shield by destroying it (or leaving it with the broken condition), forcing the shield out of its mouth with a grapple check against your CMB, or swallowing it (if it has the swallow whole ability) as if the shield were a creature.",
			"",
			"While the shield is in place, the monster cannot use its mouth to make attacks (such as a bite or a giant frog's sticky tongue) against anything but the shield and cannot speak clearly enough to cast spells or use items requiring speech.

			"",
			"*Charging Snare* (Improved Trip): You can dash toward an opponent and use your sling to trip it up. As a full-round action, you can move up to twice your speed at a foe and attempt a trip combat maneuver. This movement follows the rules of movement during a charge. You gain a +2 bonus on the combat maneuver check, and you take a -2 penalty to your AC until the start of your second turn.",
			"",
			"*Disarming Lash* (Improved Disarm): You can lash out with your sling to ensnare an opponent's weapon and pull it away. When you perform a disarm combat maneuver while wielding a sling, you can use your Dexterity modifier in place of your Strength modifier to determine your CMB.",
			"",
			"*Hurl Splash Weapon* (Far Shot, Throw Anything): You can fling a splash weapon with your sling to great effect. As a full-round action, you can use your sling to hurl a splash weapon as a ranged touch attack with a range equal to half your sling's range. This trick does not work with an alchemist's bombs.",
			"",
			"*Pouch Bandage* (Heal 5 ranks): You can rapidly wrap your sling around an ally's wound, stanching the flow of blood. When you or an ally within your reach has the bleed condition, as a standard action, you can bind the wound, stopping the bleed damage from one bleed effect; any other bleed effects still deal their bleed damage.",

			"*Flare* (Craft [alchemy] 5 ranks or alchemist bomb class feature): As a standard action, you can expend the remaining life of a sunrod (lit or unlit) in an instant. Sighted creatures within a 20-foot-radius burst of the sunrod must succeed at a DC 15 Fortitude save or be dazzled for 2d4 rounds. Creatures with light sensitivity or light blindness receive a -2 penalty on their saving throws. Alternatively, as a full-round action, you can strike a creature with the sunrod or throw the sunrod as a ranged attack with a range increment of 10 feet. When it strikes a hard surface, it flares as describe above. Since you don't have to hit a specific target, you can simply aim at the corner of particular 5-foot square. Treat the target corner as AC 5. If a creature is struck by the sunrod and fails its Fortitude save, it is blinded for the first round of its dazzled condition.",
			"",
			"*Fast Sunrod* (Quick Draw): You can draw and light an easily accessible sunrod from a pack as a swift action.",
			"",
			"*Like the Sun* (ability to cast any spell with the light descriptor): You can use a sunrod as an additional material component for any spell that bears the light descriptor. The spell is treated as one spell level higher (to a maximum of 9th level) for all purposes, including the calculation of saving throw DCs and its ability to overcome sources of magical darkness.",
			"",
			"*Lodge Sunrod* (Throw Anything): You can throw your sunrod as a ranged improvised weapon. If you hit with a ranged touch attack, the sunrod does no damage, but stays lodged on the target until the target or another creature spends a move action to remove it.",
			"",
			"*Lure* (Handle Animal 5 ranks): As a move action while holding a lit sunrod in your hand, you can attempt to move an animal in any direction you desire. Make a Handle Animal check against a DC of 15 + the target animal's CR. If you are successful, the animal moves 5 feet in the desired direction on its next turn. For every 5 points by which your check exceeds the DC, the animal moves another 5 feet, up to the animal's maximum speed. This movement provokes attacks of opportunity as normal, though if one is taken, the animal immediately stops moving (whether or not the attack hits). You cannot move an animal into an obvious hazard with this trick, but you can (for example) lure it into an open cage.",
			"",
			"*Twice as Brightly* (Craft [alchemy] 5 ranks): As full-round action, you can tamper with an unused sunrod such that it burns out in a single hour, but shines much more brightly. It sheds bright light in a 30-foot radius and increases the light level by two steps for an additional 30 feet beyond that area (darkness becomes normal light, and dim light or normal light becomes bright light). It does not increase the light level in bright light.",
