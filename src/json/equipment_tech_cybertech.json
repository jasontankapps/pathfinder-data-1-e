Though normally implanted, a cranial bomb can also be detonated outside of a body. If detonated while implanted, it deals 2d6 points of bludgeoning damage and 2d6 points of fire damage, and the recipient must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw (DC = 10 + the damage dealt) or be instantly slain. Creatures killed in this manner cannot be revived by [breath of life](spell/breath_of_life) or [raise dead](spell/raise_dead).

The arm is fully functional and no different in appearance from a regular arm, although cyberart can be added to the arm at no additional cost. A cybernetic arm does not increase a user's Strength score. If a creature has two cybernetic arms, it can lift and carry double the normal maximum weight for that creature's Strength and size, and it gains a +5 circumstance bonus on Climb checks. A character who wields a one-handed or light weapon with a cybernetic arm gains a +5 bonus to CMD against disarm attempts; two cybernetic arms do not increase this bonus, but do allow the bonus to apply to two-handed weapons."

			"A single light melee weapon or one-handed firearm can be implanted in an arm or cybernetic arm. Melee weapons extend or retract as a swift action. Ranged weapons fire through a port on the palm or back of the wrist. Either type of weapon has statistics identical to its normal form. Firearms reload through a breach in the arm, increasing the reloading time of the weapon to a full-round action, or doubling reloading times that already take a full round or longer. Implanted weapons are well concealed; detecting one requires a thorough search (Perception DC 25). Implanted weaponry can be damaged or destroyed by sundering, but cannot be disarmed. Weaponry installed in a cybernetic arm does not count against a creature's implantation limit. The cost, price, and weight of the weapon to be implanted are added to the cost, price, and weight listed in this stat block."

			"Cyberart is the least invasive of all cybertech. This implant is similar in appearance to a tattoo, except that it can glow softly if desired, providing illumination equal to that provided by a candle. Some cyberart is animated, providing a short looping scene that replays over and over. Cyberart is installed in a body with a small metallic stylus that injects low-grade nanites into a body part; the quality of the art relies on the installer's Craft (painting or tattoo) check."

			"An implant mesh is a cybernetic augmentation that enhanced other cybernetic implants, notably those that heighten their wearers' physical abilities. If used to enhance cyberfiber muscles, a thoracic nanite chamber, or wirejack tendons, an implant mesh must be installed on that piece of cyberware before the item is implanted in a body. If the check to implant the mesh into the other cybernetic item fails, the implant mesh is destroyed.",
			"",
			"Once a piece of cybertech has been augmented by an implant mesh, that cybertech implant no longer counts as taking up a body slot for the purposes of installing other cybernetic devices into that slot. Enhancing a cybernetic device with an implant mesh doesn't alter the device's install DC, but does increase its implantation value by 2. For example, a mark II thoracic nanite chamber enhanced with an implant mesh could be implanted in a creature that already has cyberfiber muscles or dermal plating, but the augmented thoracic nanite chamber's implantation value increases to 6."
