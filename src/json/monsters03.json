The target must succeed at a DC 31 Fortitude save or lose any ability it has to reproduce or bear children. This effect can be removed only by a heal, limited wish, miracle, or wish spell. Creatures that reproduce magically are not affected by this ability. The save DC is Charisma-based.",
			"",
			"**Bounteous Caster (Su)** Once per day, a veranallia can use the Eschew Materials feat to eschew any material component for a spell, regardless of the cost of the material component.",
			"",
			"**Rebirth (Su)** Once per day, a veranallia can reincarnate a willing creature she deems worthy of the honor. The creature's original body decays and sinks into the ground, affecting the surrounding area in a half-mile radius as though with plant growth (enrichment). Over the course of 1d4 days, a white, flowery cocoon emerges from the affected ground and splits open, revealing the newly reincarnated creature inside. Creatures reincarnated by a veranallia always return to life as aasimars. This ability otherwise functions as per reincarnate (CL 20th).",
			"",
			"**Spells (Sp)** Veranallias cast divine spells as 20th-level clerics. They do not gain access to domains or other cleric abilities, and can choose their spells from either the cleric spell list or the druid spell list.",
			"",
			"**Winter Sickle (Ex)** At will as a free action, a veranallia can create a jagged blade from her hoarfrost-covered vines that acts as a +3 icy burst sickle. One round after it leaves the veranallia's grasp, the weapon melts into a small puddle of water.",
			"",
			"#### Description",
			"",
			"Veranallias are among the most powerful azatas known and embody the changing of the seasons, from blossoming spring to dormant winter. They command the growth and decay of plants, control various aspects of the weather, and enrich soil with the remains of fallen foes. A veranallia stands 10 feet tall and weighs about 350 pounds.",
			"",
			"Beautiful and majestic, the queenly veranallia has a form that combines aspects of a beautiful woman and the subtle power of nature. A veranallia appears humanoid from the waist up, but where her thighs and legs should be, she instead sprouts countless vines, leaves, and various kinds of plant matter. These flora represent the life of plants throughout all stages of the year, continually shifting from blooming, verdant colors and textures to crisp, withered specimens and back in a matter of seconds.",
			"",
			"Veranallias hail from the wildest regions of Elysium, realms where few but the mightiest azatas dare tread. Veranallias are creatures of transition, preferring the unpredictable maelstroms of weather at Elysium's edges to the more temperate or consistent regions of that plane. They also have a particular appreciation for areas where one element transitions into another, such as coastlines, geysers, hot springs, and underground lakes. Many among their kind can be found in the lush fields or various heavily wooded forests throughout Elysium, particularly woodlands where the flora changes color almost at random. It is thought the annual tribunals of elder veranallias are actually the source of the eldritch woodland's transformative climate and shifting composition.",
			"",
			"At first glance, a veranallia's body appears to be wrapped in foliage, but these vines are actually a part of the azata's strange physiology. She is not subject to blight or similar plants affecting magic, but attempts to use such abilities to hinder her provoke a veranallia's ire like little else. A veranallia's vines can entwine and crush an enemy as easily as a python would crush a field mouse. These vines often change appearance based on the veranallia's environment, but not always in a predictable or sensible manner.",
			"",
			"Veranallias often prefer the company of other azatas, and often have a following of faithful bralanis or ghaeles. Their volatile natures can make it quite difficult for many other creatures, even other azatas' to be involved with them. For example, lillends are not inspired by the dangerous power of veranallias, and brijidines' belief in the cleansing power of fire does not make friendship with the verdant veranallias easy. While most other celestials concede that veranallias have only the best intentions, most would still rather deal with more predictable members of the celestial planes. Archons in particular find it almost impossible to speak to veranallias, and the noble angels and agathions have trouble following a veranallia's leaps in logic and rapidly shifting moods.",
			"",
			"### Veranallia Elder",
			"",
			"The most powerful of the veranallias are ancient entities indeed, beings known as veranallia elders. These veranallias appear as aged but still beautiful specimens, their upper human bodies looking like elderly women and their lower bodies always featuring what seems to be vegetation in late autumnal colors of red, yellow, and brown. As a general rule, veranallia elders have additional Hit Dice and vary in power from CR 21 to CR 25 - they rarely take class levels, but often have powerful unique abilities beyond the capability of the standard veranallia. Two example veranallia elder powers are presented below.",
			"",
			"Mastery of Life (Su): As an immediate action, the veranallia elder can target any creature within 60 feet that has been killed within the last round by a breath of life effect (CL 20th). A creature restored to life by this effect gains fast healing 20 for 10 rounds.",
			"",
			"Create Gate (Su): A veranallia elder is able to create a gate between Elysium and the Material Plane once per day, as per the spell gate, but can do so only to allow travel between the two worlds. On the Material Plane end, the gate must open up into a wilderness area of natural beauty. Once created, such a gate exists until the veranallia elder is slain or chooses to end the effect. A veranallia elder can maintain up to three such gates at once; if it makes a fourth gate, it chooses which of the three gates that it previously created is then ended as a result.",

If successful, the yamah absorbs the magical energy and converts it into a bolt of force. A yamah can use a force bolt to make a ranged touch attack that deals 1d6 points of force damage for every spell level of the effect dispelled by the yamah (for example, if a yamah dispels a 2nd-level spell with its steal magic ability, the resulting force bolt deals 2d6 points of force damage; 0-level spells count as being 1st level for the purpose of this ability). These force bolts have a range of 100 feet. A yamah can only carry a number of force bolts equal to its Charisma bonus (5 for most yamahs), and any force bolts not used within 24 hours of being obtained disappear and are wasted.",
			"",

			"Yamahs travel throughout the planes promoting the ideals of freedom and fairness, using their unique talents to rob evildoers of their magic and turn it into a weapon for good. Yamahs harbor ill will toward anyone who would use magic for cruel or evil purposes, especially necromancers and creatures that use magic to trap souls and pervert life.",
			"",

The white markings that cover their bodies may at first appear to be tattoos, but are actually natural sigils unique to each individual. The average yamah stands just over 6 feet tall and weighs 140 pounds.",
			"",
			"Yamahs can often be encountered during lunar eclipses and other significant celestial events in regions where worship of any chaotic good deity or demigod is strong. Legends among such faiths claim that yamahs sometimes accompany good spellcasters on crusades against otherworldly fiends, though every story inevitably ends with the yamah mysteriously departing after the deed is done, abandoning its mortal partner without a word.",

			"**Burning Blindness (Su)** When an azgenzak confirms a critical hit or a creature fails its save against the distraction attack of its swarming pyrocules, the azgenzak attempts to pluck out one of the target's eyes (Fortitude DC 20 negates). If the save fails, the target takes 1d6 additional points of fire damage, is sickened by pain for 1d4 rounds, and becomes permanently dazzled. If this results in the loss of all of the target's eyes, it is permanently blinded.",
			"",
			"**Inversion (Ex)** As a move action, an azgenzak can invert its sac-like body, turning itself inside out and exposing its innumerable burning eyes. Doing so surrounds the azgenzak with a fiery aura and activates its frightful presence ability. These abilities are suppressed when the azgenzak is not inverted. When it's inverted, creatures adjacent to the azgenzak take 2d6 points of fire damage and risk {rule/catching on fire}. A successful DC 16 Reflex save halves this damage and keeps the creature from catching on fire. An inverted azgenzak loses its racial bonus to Stealth underwater and takes a further -10 penalty on Stealth checks. In addition, when inverted, an azgenzak can't swallow its victim whole; however, if it begins its turn with a creature grappled, it can revert itself as a move action and then use its swallow whole ability. A creature swallowed by an azgenzak is subject to its fiery aura and frightful presence even when the azgenzak is not inverted.",
			"",
			"**Swarming Pyrocules (Su)** As a full-round action, an azgenzak can disgorge a swarm of burning eyeballs. This swarm has the same statistics as a bat swarm, except it lacks the wounding special ability, which is replaced by the azgenzak's burn ability and immunity to fire. An azgenzak using this ability takes 2d6 points of damage (though damage dealt to the swarming pyrocules does not damage the azgenzak). The swarming pyrocules can't survive long separated from the azgenzak, and take 1 point of damage each round at the end of its turn. The swarming pyrocules can be reabsorbed by the azgenzak as a full-round action, healing the creature of 1d6 points of damage.",
			"",
			"#### Description",
			"",
			"Azgenzaks, also called more prosaically \"sacks of burning eyes,\" are shapeless predators of unfathomable appetites and undeniable malevolence. They might have congealed into existence within some forgotten crack of the Outer Rifts, escaping (or being set loose) into the Material Plane ages ago. However, many theorize that these beings are entirely natural, primeval creatures that fell into savagery or never evolved from their primitive state in the first place. Azgenzaks are roughly 8 feet in diameter and weigh over 800 pounds.",
			"",
			"### Ecology",
			"",
			"Azgenzaks are amorphous, their bodies composed of a flaccid, leathery outer skin enveloping an interior of glistening, wrinkled tissue, which in turn surrounds hundreds of cilia-rimmed sockets that weep flammable mucus. An azgenzak can suppress its flames by squeezing its sac tightly closed, but it rarely does so unless it has need for stealth. If it wishes to maintain its flames even when it dives underwater, it simply enfolds a large bubble of air within its fundus, seals the aperture with a layer of mucus, and inflates itself into a lumpy spheroid, periodically venting exhaust gases to propel itself through the water. A rush of foul-scented bubbles and brief flares of deep orange below the water's surface usually accompany such venting as jets of flame escape the azgenzak's interior and are snuffed out.",
			"",
			"Azgenzaks are primarily carnivorous, though they're able to digest any organic material, engulfing it within their flaming cavities. An azgenzak that has recently feasted - having swallowed its prey whole - might sink to the bottom of a body of water and enfold itself to slowly digest its meal, settling into a torpor for days or even weeks at a time. If undisturbed, a hibernating azgenzak might appear indistinguishable from an algae-covered boulder, a rotting log, or submerged carrion.",
			"",
			"Azgenzaks reproduce by asexual budding, which is abetted in some unknown way by the vitreous humors found within eyeballs. Its drive to extract the eyes of its prey is to further of its attempts at reproduction, as the distilled essence of the eyes it steals germinates tissue buds within the depths of its stomach. These buds then replicate and mat together into a translucent sheath of tissue, with a portion of the eyes within the azgenzak adsorbing into this sheath as it grows. Once a sufficient sheath-mass has accreted, it begins sloughing off from the parent azgenzak's stomach walls, and is eventually disgorged and discarded in a steaming puddle of semi-solid translucent slime shot through with eyeballs. Now ravenously hungry, the parent moves on to feast elsewhere and replenish its discarded mass. Meanwhile, the newly birthed azgenzak begins to darken and congeal, baked from within by the unquenchable heat of its burning eyes, even as its outer tissues are tempered by exposure to open air and water, gradually toughening into a mottled brown outer skin. Gorging itself on organic matter, the newly formed azgenzak matures within a month and can begin to unleash the swarming pyrocules that are its deadly signature.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"Azgenzaks are solitary creatures, despising the presence of others of their kind as rivals for their hunting terrain. They prefer to make their dens in murky lakes, though they are equally happy in swamps, bogs, and even slowmoving rivers. They are not powerful swimmers and avoid fast-moving water, though they are perfectly capable of climbing out of the water and traversing land in an undulant slither. Their malleable mass is able to ooze over, around, and between obstacles that might block the passage of a more solid creature.",
			"",
			"Azgenzaks are sometimes confused with will-o'-wisps in folktales and legends, as both dwell in boglands and are blamed for mysterious marshlights that lead travelers to their doom. This is because azgenzaks are thought of more in terms of the swarming pyrocules they unleash rather than their true bodies - the strings of floating, flaming eyes are often believed to be the true creature and the \"bag\" of its body a gate to Hell, a fleshy opening into the Abyss, or a shroud stitched from the skins of its victims. In many cultures, strange bubbling and dancing marshlights below the water or bobbing above bogs are seen as portents of death even when seen in the far distance, regardless of the creature responsible. In lands where azgenzaks are known to dwell, animals are often blindered at night and children are taught to keep shutters and curtains drawn tight to avoid seeing the deadly lights.",
			"",
			"In truth, azgenzaks are fairly simple creatures, mostly interested in their next meal. That said, they prefer the flesh of sentient victims and the screams of victims perishing in fear and fire. While they have no love for will-o'-wisps, they do sense a certain kinship with them, and more importantly they perceive the advantages of working with them to secure prey. Will-o'-wisps themselves offer no sustenance for an azgenzak, with their nearly immaterial bodies, but an azgenzak's ability to instill fear has much to offer hunting will-o'-wisps. The two creatures thus sometimes work in concert, with the azgenzak feasting physically upon its victims while the will-o'-wisp feeds psychically."

			"Some monsters feed on humans, while others torture humans for their own sadistic pleasure, but few creatures go to such perverse lengths as to murder humans and then sell the processed remains back to their victims' unwitting families. Bagmen are such monsters' degenerate fey creatures who specialize in kidnapping humanoid victims and harvesting their fat to produce potions. Bagmen disguise themselves as traveling peddlers and apothecaries, often selling the products of their depredations to the very communities from which they steal their victims. An average bagman stands 5-1/2 feet tall and weighs close to 300 pounds.",
			"",
			"### Ecology",
			"",
			"Bagmen are nomadic creatures, traveling from town to town to peddle their disgusting wares. They prefer to travel by lesser-used roads, or even through stretches of wilderness, the better to happen upon lone travelers. Bagmen are opportunistic hunters, and rarely bother to set up ambushes or execute convoluted plans. If one happens upon an individual it thinks it can kidnap without repercussions - especially if that individual is sleeping or otherwise unable to properly defend himself - it simply snatches that person up and adjourns to a more private location to kill the person and harvest his fat.",
			"",
			"Children are an exception to this rule. Bagmen greatly value the fat of children, and employ a variety of tricks and threats to lure children away from the safety of their homes and families. When a group of children is traveling with just one or two adults, bagmen delight in attacking the group and bull rushing the weakest children away from their protectors; once the children have scattered, the bagmen find it much easier to snatch them and abscond with them to their lairs. Despite being far stronger and tougher than the average human, bagmen are quite cowardly. They eschew fighting with armed creatures, and hesitate to attack when outnumbered by combatants.",
			"",
			"Many claim that bagmen consume the fat they harvest from their victims for sustenance, and in many cultures the name for bagmen directly translates to \"fat-eater\" or \"fat-stealer.\" However, this accusation is largely false, and is most likely based on bagmen's waxen flesh and greasy complexions. In truth, fat is the one part of a creature a bagman almost never eats, having far greater use for it as an ingredient in horrifying potions it lures unsuspecting customers to imbibe. The rest - muscles, bones, organs, and all - the bagman consumes with unnatural rapidity in order to dispose of any evidence of its crime.",
			"",
			"It is unclear whether bagmen are capable of reproduction, or even how new bagmen come into being in the first place. Some scholars suggest that bagmen are the result of unnatural unions among fey, or between fey and a variety of evil outsiders. A few believe that new bagmen arise when evil energies permeate a bagman's cache of humanoid fat that hasn't already been turned into potions. Others claim that bagmen spontaneously manifest as a representation of the society's willingness to consume itself, such as when the rich and powerful profit at the expense of the poor and meek.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"Bagmen are adept at disguising themselves as humans, and they use this ability to spend prolonged periods of time in human settlements. Here, they sell the potions they've produced using the fat of their victims. The gold they earn from these sales is less important to bagmen than the perverse pleasure they gain from revealing the nature of their wares to their horrified customers. Of course, customers' disgust is usually short lived; those who discover a bagman's terrible secret are usually the next ones into its bag. Bagmen who worry that their secret has spread throughout a populace, or that the public is suspicious of their activities, usually flee the area immediately. This has led to more than a few hastily abandoned merchant stalls, leaving the requisite authorities to eventually discover, to their horror, the true nature of the strange being who was once living and committing terrible crimes in their midst.",
			"",
			"While bagmen primarily delight in horrifying customers, they don't scorn the profits they garner. Indeed, bagmen are profligate spenders, and exploit their ability to pass for human to partake in all the pleasures of the flesh available in human cities. Bagmen's proclivity for gluttony often brings them into contact with cultists of Urgathoa, and alliances between bagmen and Urgathoans can be particularly fruitful. Bagmen provide potions and scouting services to Urgathoans at a steep discount, and in return they get to join the cultists in their dark feasts and rituals.",
			"",
			"Associating with Urgathoans has other benefits for bagmen, as well. Those who are afflicted by plagues sometimes make pleas to the Pallid Princess, and bagmen are happy to answer those prayers, albeit for a price. Bagmen relish this chance to offer potions of infernal healing or potions of youthful appearance as false cures; many potential victims see through the ruse immediately, but some of the most desperate fall for the bagmen's lies. The unluckiest ones are even willing to give in to the bagmen's demands, which may go so far as to include the lives of the afflicted person's loved ones or children, taken by the person's own hands at the bagman's urging. Other times, bagmen simply request information about their customers' families, and eventually use that information to terrible effect."

This frame supports the stone-and-ivy skin and provides the space in which the plant matter that will make up the barometz can grow. Each cultivator attempts a DC 25 Knowledge (nature) check when forming the body. If one or more of the checks fail, the plant withers and dies and the cultivators must begin anew.",

			"",
			"#### Description",
			"",
			"Covered in shaggy hair that envelops the entirety of their immense bodies other than their faces, basavans resemble exceptionally hirsute giants. Wise and peaceful stewards of the wilderness, basavans protect the plants and animals that share their homes in wooded mountains across Golarion. Basavans are likely to let unwitting trespassers off with a warning, but against predators and poachers they deal powerful blows with staves and stones, using their innate connection to the land to locate and trap their foes.",
			"",
			"Basavans are 24 feet tall and weigh 17,000 pounds.",
			"",
			"Basavans are reclusive creatures who spend their whole lives in isolated mountain valleys or ranging through hillside forests. The few aware of the existence of basavans - normally druids and other wilderness protectors - know them to be staunch defenders of the wilderness, yet none agree on where and when basavans originated. The basavans themselves claim to be as old as the forests but not quite as old as the mountains, but they deliver this information with a merry twinkle in their eyes. Basavans bear children only rarely, and in such seclusion that young basavans are virtually never seen by anyone other than their parents until they mature and join them in protecting their lands. Young basavans, born entirely hairless and with skin that resembles thick bark, appear very different from their parents. They grow their hair quickly as they age, but shed all of it twice in their youth. A basavan's hair is usually dark brown, but might be black, tawny, or even deep auburn. Basavans consider their hair useful for warmth and in their daily work, such as to make crude twine or as nesting material for animals, but they rarely take care of it and therefore have a shaggy, wild appearance.",
			"",
			"A basavan designates a wide strip of primeval forest or mountains as its personal protected domain; often, this area is dozens or hundreds of square miles in size. A basavan usually keeps intruders out of its lands personally, although a few that share a border with hermits, trappers, or shepherds teach these hardy folk how to identify and repel intruders as well. Basavans tend to injured plants and animals in their personal domains, creating a lush bounty and safe haven for animals.",
			"",
			"Basavans are herbivores, and most subsist on only a small meal every few days. Despite their limited diet, basavans are incredibly massive, with powerful muscles and robust constitutions. They are remarkably athletic, able to scale cliffs and swim across rough rivers with ease. Basavans bring a focused efficiency to even the most physically demanding labor, but they take care to avoid disturbing vegetation or upsetting wildlife even when traveling quickly across their terrain.",
			"",
			"Basavans are skilled smiths, and most devote their lives to a single type of craft, such as working with iron, stone, or wood. Although they generally don't maintain lairs, as they prefer to sleep in the wild, they often hollow out caves to use as a forges or workshops, expanding their caves as they age. Basavans use the simple tools they create in their stewardship of the land or as gifts to nearby peaceful communities.",
			"",
			"These hardy creatures age very slowly and generally live to be 600 or 700 years old. Elderly basavans become true masters of the crafts they pursue.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"Although basavans are reclusive, a rare few of these hairy giants venture out into communities near their protected lands. Such basavans sometimes consider nearby shepherds, farmers, or settlers to be under their protection, and they might help rebuild a home destroyed by a flood or round up livestock lost in a storm. Although basavans almost never hunt or kill animals, they don't mind when humanoids under their protection do. They enjoy imparting ancient secrets of farming or animal husbandry to such neighbors, encouraging a deeper respect for the local environment. These communities might engineer a system to summon their guardian basavan in the event of a raid, natural disaster, or other serious need; such warning systems often consist of bells, whistles, or bright flags. A basavan withholds its protection and training from those who demonstrate a wanton disregard for the land, such as by being reckless with fire or butchering animals for sport. These actions provoke the normally peaceful creatures into a rage, causing them to exile or even kill the offenders.",
			"",
			"Basavans rarely gather in large groups, and some might go their entire lives without seeing more than a handful of others of their kind. When they do gather in small groups, such as families, basavans work together in an eerie unison that hints at some deep mutual communion. In these groups, males defer to females for protection, as the females tend to be larger and stronger, but in other matters the basavans tend to defer to the oldest among them.",
			"",
			"Because of the old lore basavans keep, many sages, druids, and explorers seek them out in order to gain their knowledge. Visitors must be prepared with a deep well of patience and work for days or weeks to prove they have at least rudimentary skill in woodcraft or caring for animals. During this time, even if the basavan doesn't show itself to the visitor, it is watchful for any slip that might reveal anything other than benevolent intentions toward the natural world. Once a visitor proves herself, however, the basavan is a gracious host and eager to share its guidance. Some basavans display a sly wit in these conversations, making lighthearted jokes at their visitors' expense."

They tend to make their lairs in caves, burrows, or other sheltered areas, and these dens are often marked by statues of people and animals in lifelike poses - the petrified remains of those unfortunate enough to stumble across the basilisk.",
			"",
			"Basilisks have the ability to consume the creatures they petrify, their churning stomach acid dissolving and extracting nutrients from the stone, but the process is slow and inefficient, making them lazy and sluggish. As a result, basilisks rarely stalk prey or chase those who avoid their gaze, counting on their stealth and the element of surprise to keep them safe and fed. When not lying in wait for the small mammals, birds, and reptiles that normally make up their diet, basilisks spend their time sleeping in their lairs, and those brave enough to capture basilisks or hide treasure near them find that they make natural guardians and watchdogs.",
			"",
			"An adult basilisk is 13 feet long, with fully half of that made up by its long tail, and weighs 300 pounds. Some breeds have short, curved horns on their noses or small crests of bony growths topping their heads like crowns. Though normally solitary creatures, coming together only to mate and lay eggs, in particularly dangerous areas small groups may band together for protection and attack intruders en masse.",
			"",
			"For unknown reasons, weasels and ferrets are immune to the basilisk's stare, and sometimes sneak into basilisk lairs while a parent is hunting in order to consume its young. Some legends suggest that a basilisk's blood can transmute common stones into other material, but this is likely a case of witnesses misinterpreting the magical restoration of previously petrified creatures or body parts."

This shock wave lasts for 1 round, during which time creatures in the affected area cannot move or attack. They must also succeed on a DC 38 Reflex save or fall prone. Any spellcaster on the ground must make a Concentration check (DC 20 + spell level) or lose any spell he or she tries to cast. The save DC is Strength-based.",
			"",
			"**Swallow Whole (Ex)** A ravener behemoth can swallow a snatched opponent of Huge size or smaller with its bite attack by making a successful grapple check. Once swallowed, a victim suffers 4d6+24 points of bludgeoning damage per round from one of the behemoth's 5 stomachs. A swallowed creature can cut its way out by using a light slashing or piercing weapon to deal 33 points of damage to a stomach (AC 27). Once the creature exits, that stomach regenerates 15 hit points per round. A ravener behemoth may gorge itself upon multiple creatures, shunting each victim to a different stomach each time. Each of a behemoth's 5 stomachs can hold 1 Huge, 4 Large, 16 Medium, 64 Small, 256 Tiny, or over 1,000 Diminutive or smaller creatures.",

			"Ravener behemoths walk the land as the ultimate consumers of all things. This includes every manner of beast, plant, and mineral caught in their path. They indiscriminately fill their five ever-hungry stomachs by cutting wide swaths through tangled jungles, digging through mountains for precious ores, and razing settlements and strongholds to get at those sheltering inside. Sometimes they even ply shallow coastal waters, capsizing ships to feast upon their crews and any other predators drawn by the smell of blood in the water.",
			"",
			"Monstrously massive, a ravener behemoth stands nearly 60 feet tall on four thick, trunk-like legs and measures up to 80 feet long. Multiple horns and tusks sprout from its face and head, helping it root through even the hardest soil and rocks in search of food. It quickly reduces anything stronger into rubble with its earth-shattering roar and stomping feet. A rocky hide grown from the many minerals it routinely consumes protects it from harm even as lichen, small plants, and trees take root along its back, out of reach of its ravenous mouth. Divine blessings bequeathed by the gods ensure only the most powerful spells or adamantine weapons can lay a behemoth low. As a result, the ravener behemoth fears nothing and eats everything.",

			"Some ancient raveners retain a measure of their original sentience, occasionally renewing their relationships with the gods to serve as avatars or guardians. Others choose to remain aloof, pursuing their own goals independent of those who created them. These more potent behemoths sustain themselves through divine rituals learned when they served the gods and passed down from one generation to the next. They use their spell-like abilities to enhance the land and better support their enormous appetites. To replicate these more intelligent and independent raveners, add the following abilities to the standard behemoth. A ravener with these abilities is CR 19 and has Int 14, Wis 18, and Cha 18. It speaks Celestial, Sylvan, and Terran.",

The belostomatid's front two legs are thick and end in sharp, single-tipped claws, which it uses to slay its prey. Two large black eyes are mounted on each side of the creature's rostrum, and it uses its 2-foot-long, beaklike proboscis to inject its deadly acidic enzymes into its victims.",

With a powerful surge forward, a belostomatid grabs its prey, thrusts its rostrum deep into the prey's body, and begins pumping a paralyzing digestive enzyme into its prey, dissolving it from the inside out."

To augment this process, the priests used slender, flesh-devouring worms that were imbued with divine blessings. Over the course of a lengthy ritual, priests sealed the deceased's entire body in sacred clay. As the clay hardened, they sculpted it to resemble the likeness of the deceased, forming a sort of statue-like sarcophagus that stood upright. The only portions of this clay vessel that were left unsealed were holes that allowed access to the individual's eyes and mouth. Then Fandarra's priests placed three of the sacred worms into each of the vessel's openings. Lastly, the priests sealed the openings with wax.

It is a manifestation of rage at the injustice of a death that interrupted important business or unsated desires. Doomed to haunt the wilderness within several miles of the site of its demise, a bhuta turns to the local fauna as tools for its vengeance.",
			"",
			"A bhuta can appear in a variety of animalistic forms by using its veil ability, but its natural appearance is that of a bestial humanoid phantom that floats a foot above the ground as it moves. While bhutas are incorporeal, the touch of their claws creates horrific, bleeding wounds. A bhuta's feet point backward. To disguise its nature, a bhuta can appear solid, manifesting in long robes that help disguise the fact that it floats and has strange feet. By means of its magic jar spell-like ability, a bhuta can also possess living animals to use as its minions; an animal possessed by a bhuta casts no shadow, and therefore prefers to lurk in heavily canopied or thicketed areas, waiting for the right time to strike out and attack intruders.",
			"",
			"Animals find themselves attracted to bhutas, which use their spell-like abilities to manipulate such victims toward evil and deceptive ends. Bhutas generally avoid influencing animal companions or domesticated animals, for changes in behavior among such creatures can easily arouse suspicion and reveal a bhuta's presence and influence.",
			"",
			"A bhuta might have tasks it wishes to complete from its previous existence as a living creature, or it might work against those who slew its living form. This link to its past life is vague and compulsive rather than clear, unlike that of a ghost.",
			"",
			"Bhutas who have no specific target for retribution still seek to trouble those living in or near their domains, coaxing passersby into accepting them as traveling companions and using their influence over animals as a testament to their benevolence. When invited to join a group, a bhuta can journey outside its normal territory. However, a bhuta's hunger for living blood usually drives it to attack its companions before it wanders far."

",

			"",
			"#### Description",
			"",
			"In ages past, humans didn't live apart from nature as they do now. They had no cities, no farms, and no metal tools. In this primitive time, humans lived as beasts, hunting and foraging in the savage wild, living and dying by the cruel whims of nature. To these early humans, a successful hunt sometimes meant the difference between the life of the tribe and utter extinction. For this reason, the land and the animals who lived on it commanded great respect among the tribes. The environment represented more than just food or clothing or territory; it was an ally, an enemy, or even a god unto itself.",
			"",
			"There was need in those days for people who could pass from the physical world and into the world of the spirits, where they could intercede with the spirits of the land and the animals to ensure the tribe's survival. From this need came the birelus, manifestations of humankind's desire to bridge the boundary between humans and nature. These ancient beings served as guardians and travelers of the paths between worlds.",
			"",
			"A birelu seems to both stand upright and walk upon all fours at the same time, its form shifting and flowing incomprehensibly between the two poses. Even while partially hunched in this manner, a birelu stands over 7 feet tall when in its natural state.",
			"",
			"Birelus are ancient beings, having existed since time immemorial. It may be that they were born at the very dawn of time, champions of a unity between humankind and nature that would not exist on the Material Plane for eons hence, and simply waited to intrude upon the world when it was ready for them. More likely, they owe their existence to humankind itself, springing to life as the manifestation of ideas held sacred by the early mortal races. Whatever the case, birelus came to Golarion when the mortal races were still young. In those primordial times, they acted as guardians and guides, teaching the first mortal shamans how to cross the boundaries between the physical world and the spirit world, and bringing terrible destruction upon those who violated that sacred boundary. These early birelus sought to guide humanity, to groom its growth in harmony with nature as a way to restrict the destructive tendencies of civilization. Despite these efforts, humanity marched forward through time to establish cities, discover arcane magic, and usher in the destruction that the early birelus had attempted to hinder.",
			"",
			"As outsiders, birelus don't need to eat or drink to survive, though they take great pleasure in hunting and feeding on wild prey. Most often they hunt while possessing the body of an animal, usually the apex predator of the local environment. Occasionally, a birelu stalks its prey in the possessed body of a humanoid, though typically this is done to honor the humanoid host. As much as they delight in such behavior, birelus never over-hunt an area, and they seem to have an innate sense about the state of the local ecology.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"Birelus have no set habitat, nor do they hold territory, preferring instead to wander the wild places of the world. Birelus don't often intrude upon inhabited areas, though when they do, the results are often disastrous. They find the trappings of civilized life distasteful, even blasphemous, and focus their attentions on destroying the objects of their ire. Often they accomplish this by possessing people and turning them against their own homes and their fellow citizens. Birelus can sometimes be reasoned with and convinced to depart in peace, but this is rare, as their attacks are often confused for the actions of lycanthropes, and are met with violence rather than diplomacy by mortal humanoids.",
			"",
			"For the most part, birelus are solitary creatures. They don't scorn the company of their own kind, but neither do they delight in it or seek it out. Birelus who meet in passing are more likely to ignore each other than to interact in any meaningful way. Some have speculated that there may in fact be only one birelu, and that those specimens encountered on Golarion emanate from it or serve as its avatars.",
			"",
			"A birelu's attentions are drawn to animals more often than to any other kind of creature, earning them the title \"spirits of the beasts\" in some cultures. Birelus seem to delight in possessing animals and using their bodies to explore and interact with the world. Upon entering new territory, a birelu uses its call animal spell-like ability to draw in potential hosts, choosing the strongest and fastest of the native creatures to inhabit. Birelus are very protective of their wild animal hosts, and they abandon a creature's body if the animal is at grave risk rather than fighting to the host's death. Domesticated animals - or those serving as animal companions to the birelu's enemies - don't receive the same consideration.",
			"",
			"Birelus' interactions with humanoids are more complicated. Civilized peoples hold no interest to them, and in fact often earn their scorn. Birelus react with hostility toward those who openly bear the signs of civilization, such as worked metal or agricultural tools. A birelu's attitude is much softer toward less civilized humanoids. Primitive tribes of hunter-gatherers and those who shun the cities of the world and live in communion with nature are often able to make peaceful contact with a birelu. In return, the birelu might draw in prey animals to feed the tribe, or guide them to more fertile lands in times of scarcity. It may even join the tribe's warriors in combat against their enemies, leaping from warrior to warrior in order to grant them the benefits of greater animal aspect."

These theories are likely born of the undeniable affinity the dog-creatures have with witches, and the hounds often masquerade as lonely travelers, lost and afraid in the wilds, thanks to their ability to take on the form of such woebegone souls. However, some tales contradict this entirely, telling of black shucks that take care of travelers who cross wild places alone and take vengeance on those who would harm defenseless wanderers.

Black shucks have ravenous appetites and can readily clear a large area of prey, leaving only their own foul droppings and scentmarks behind.",

Unlikely as this tale is to be true, it is well-known enough that even the rumor of a black shuck's presence is often enough to scare travelers away from a path for months.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"Black shucks are natural loners; thus, barring the outside influence of a cover, they rarely form bonds with any other creatures, even of their own kind. However, black shucks develop a particular affinity - and even affection - for particular paths and byways, often using the same such routes over and over again, and sometimes even forming their own paths through gradual wear. So great is the creature's bond to its homeland that forcing it to leave its chosen territory often causes a black shuck to wither and die of homesick longing.",
			"",
			"Black shucks maintain lairs that they return to during the day when they rest; they hunt only at night except in times of desperation or on the foggiest of days. A shuck's primary lair is almost always somewhere well hidden or difficult to reach, whether in the center of a tangled gorse patch, among the loose stones at the foot of gravelly cliffs, or within the briar-infested corners of long-disused graveyards. Occasionally a black shuck keeps several lairs spread across a larger territory, which allows it to prey on travelers for longer stretches of time without raising too much suspicion in any one community.",
			"",
			"Black shucks often take advantage of the camaraderie of travelers, changing into human forms and luring lone wanderers further into a foggy moor with promises of a cache of food, a comfortable camp, or simple companionship. Once a victim is in a black shuck's preferred killing ground, the beast transforms into its true form and viciously ambushes the poor soul, whose picked-clean remains are almost never found, having sunk into the moist ground to join countless others.",
			"",
			"Rarely, a black shuck develops a curious benevolent edge to its hunting, watching over lone travelers along a particular path or swampy stretch instead of attacking them. Such hounds prefer to prey on robbers and thieves who attempt to victimize those in their territory, and they sometimes even take on the form of vulnerable and lonely human travelers to attract villains to them. Those who have found themselves aided by such a shuck often claim its eye was colored deep blue, not green.",
			"",
			"### Old Shuck",
			"",
			"The black shuck's close association with witches and witchcraft has led to countless local variants of the hound, as foul rituals have changed the already-fearsome creatures into even more nightmarish beasts. One of the most commonly encountered variants is that known as an old shuck, a beast often formed when a coven of witches or hags adopts a black shuck and adapts it to their needs. These leaner, more brutish versions of a black shuck have 13 Hit Dice and the ability to cause storms in their home territory. Once per day, by spending 10 minutes pacing its territory in a specific pattern, an old shuck can call forth a storm as per {spell/control weather} (CL 13th). The type of storm created and its effects depend upon the prevalent climate and season. In addition, once per day when a target fails its save against the old shuck's green-eyed gaze, the target must succeed at a DC 18 Will save or perish. The save DC is Charisma-based. Old shucks are CR 10 creatures."

If the mountain blight's cursed domain is already located in an area counted as a high peak, the effects of altitude sickness manifest immediately rather than after a 6-hour period spent in the area. Furthermore, as soon as a creature fails a Fortitude save against this effect, it suffers the effects of [slow suffocation](rule/suffocation). Characters in these zones must attempt regular Fortitude saves to avoid suffering from fatigue and other effects of [altitude sickness](rule/mountain_travel). A mountain blight is always considered to be acclimated to its domain and never suffers ill effects from this ability, and it can select creatures within this domain to be similarly protected as a free action.",

They live in the darkest, dampest regions of cavernous sprawls, particularly enjoying underground bogs, lakes, rivers, and swamps. Although not aquatic, blindheims are excellent swimmers. They prefer to latch onto branches or rock outcroppings, where they maintain the high ground while in pursuit of food. They use the light from their eyes to attract prey, but go dark when larger creatures approach. A blindheim uses its blinding gaze to disorient both prey and possible threats, then deactivates its gaze to scuttle away in the dark if the threat is too great. In very large caverns inhabited by blindheims, distant areas often flicker from brightly lit to absolutely dark as the creatures feed and flee. Though of animal-level intelligence, blindheims are cunning enough to coordinate their hunting tactics with others of their kind, using one creature to act as a lookout and make hit-and-run attacks with its gaze until its fellows can arrive to help finish off the prey.",
			"",
			"Blindheims can convey simple information through gestures and flashes of their lights, and tend to be rather silent in combat, adding an eerie element to battles with them. They cannot be taught to perform humanoid-appropriate labors and thus make poor slaves, though the duergar and drow sometimes use them as bait or distractions when raiding. Other races have been known to train these creatures as mobile light sources when going on long underground expeditions.",
			"",
			"Stout and thick-skinned, a blindheim is just under 4 feet in height and weighs 150 pounds. A blindheim gives birth to small litters of three or four young. Though gestation can last up to a full year, it only takes about 4 years for a blindheim to mature and become self-reliant, at which point the creatures generally form broods that stick together, only striking out on their own if their brethren have perished. Blindheims can live for up to 25 years."

			"Though they resemble sleek, long-eared canines, blink dogs are as smart as humans. As social creatures, blink dogs travel in large packs, roaming forests and plains, running off evil creatures, and hunting for phase spiders - one of their natural enemies. Despite their intelligence and friendly natures, blink dogs tend to avoid humanoids, keeping their packs either hidden or frequently on the move. This shyness doesn't keep the blink dogs from helping out when needed, however, and they have been known to come to the rescue of a prairie village in their territory. Packs are typically led by an older, experienced male or female, called an alpha.",
			"",
			"Blink dogs are fiercely loyal, defending their own pack or creatures they befriend to the death, and maintaining oaths handed down from litter to litter. Honor is paramount to blink dogs, and different packs often have unique traditions (such as whether a pack's alpha is male or female, or an oath to always protect and aid a particular humanoid race like elves or halflings) in addition to those shared by most blink dogs. Blink dogs have a great interest in the stars and movements of celestial bodies. Through their myths and folklore, blink dogs have names for constellations, and through this zodiac they note the seasons, births under auspicious stars, and omens from unusual stellar conjunctions. Blink dog names often contain a reference to a specific constellation under which the dog was born.",
			"",

			"A pack's alpha selects the wisest and most intelligent member of the pack to serve as its sage. This blink dog often has sorcerer levels (typically with the celestial or destined bloodline) and is charged with maintaining the long-running oral histories of the pack, which extend back for centuries and link the packs together. A blink dog sage also decides when a pup is old enough to join his first hunt, performs birth and burial rites, and counsels the alpha on the meaning of omens or upon tactical matters involving interactions with neighboring races and creatures. In some packs, the sage is the alpha's mate, while in others the sage is always a gray-muzzled elder hound beyond breeding age."

A swarm of blood algae is at least 10 feet wide and consists of hundreds or thousands of these wormlike organisms.",

			"",
			"Blood algae swarms are diurnal, floating toward the water's surface in sunny weather and sinking to the bottom at night. These creatures absorb some nutrients directly from the water, but to survive longer periods of time, they must feed on living creatures such as crustaceans, fish, or mammals. Blood algae attach themselves to their prey's skin, inserting needlelike protrusions in the flesh, through which they can feed.",
			"",
			"Blood algae reproduce both sexually and asexually, although a swarm usually uses the latter method only when recovering from losses caused by environmental dangers or predation. A swarm of blood algae consists of a roughly equal number of male and female individuals, but members of the same swarm don't usually reproduce with one another. Instead, a swarm seeks out another swarm for a violent-looking mating ritual, which churns the water with blood-red pigment.",

			"Many an unsuspecting victim has been lured to a blood lily by its large radiant blossom - a ball of scarlet spikes reminiscent of a sea urchin. Those who live near blood lilies know to be wary of the plants, but as non-animate blood lilies also grow in such areas, it can be difficult to tell the dangerous plants from the inert ones. To complicate matters, blood lilies have learned to hide their scarlet petals when hunting. A favorite trick of these plants is to disguise themselves next to ordinary blood lilies, using their harmless kin as a distraction. When travelers pass by, the predatory blood lilies then attack from concealment.",
			"",
			"Blood lilies commonly grow in tropical areas near coastlines, where they hunt both in and out of the water. Fish and other aquatic creatures are drawn to the blood lily's brilliant petals, sometimes mistaking them for colorful tropical fish. Blood lilies can slaughter and consume dozens of small fish in under a minute if a school draws close enough. Though blood lilies devour such prey whole, the masticating action of the edges of a blood lily's digestive orifice leaves clouds of blood in the water. Their blossoms also attract giant insects, which can be dangerous and damaging to the plant creatures. Blood lilies can easily defend against most of these vermin, but they almost never eat insects, preferring warm-blooded prey above all others.",
			"",
			"Blood lilies have an animalistic cunning and can use surprisingly sophisticated tactics for plants. Blood lilies that grow near the settlements of intelligent creatures (such as humans on land or merfolk underwater) keep their petals hidden and hide among other plants to better ambush their prey. When they grow in remote areas far from any settlements, they keep their petals exposed to draw in animals. Blood lilies remember the location of fertile hunting grounds and adapt their tactics based on the prey they seek. Surprisingly mobile, they sometimes travel long distances to hunt and feed at these fertile locations. A few naturalists have recorded rare blood lilies that never remain in the same area for long, roaming far and wide until they mature enough to enter a transformative hibernation.",
			"",
			"A blood lily is composed of a thick trunk plated with extremely tough but flexible green bark. An orifice lined with large thorns splits the trunk about halfway up its length. The blood lily uses this opening to devour its prey. Potent acids inside the creature's trunk dissolve fleshy organic matter quickly, allowing the lily to eat much more than would seem possible given its size.",
			"",
			"A lily's vines are covered in the same hard bark as its trunk, and the vines are lined with tiny thorns that seep poison. The blood lily gets its name not only from their vivid coloring but also from the disturbing effects of their toxin. Creatures affected by a blood lily's poison bleed from their pores, coating their skin in a light sheen of crimson. The blood lily focuses its attacks on bleeding victims, assuming they have been weakened by its toxin. However, a blood lily cannot distinguish between a creature bleeding from the blood lily's poison and one bleeding from a wound. Individuals traveling in areas where blood lilies are common sometimes carry bladders of animal blood to splash nearby during combat, confusing any blood lilies as they attack.",
			"",
			"Though most blood lilies live and hunt alone, they occasionally come together to form small pods. In particularly rich hunting grounds where the lilies don't have to compete for prey, they work together in pods to bring down victims. Pods are adept at felling large creatures or groups of smaller creatures by working in tandem. Though a pod's tactics are simple, it can take on even dangerous creatures. The blood lilies in a pod spread out and conceal their petals until their target is in range, and then they all unleash their petal barrages at once. The nearest lily then moves to attack with its vine lash while the other lilies continue to fire petal spikes until they deplete their reserves. All lilies then move in to finish off their victim with vine lashes.",
			"",
			"Blood lilies reproduce asexually. Once a lily matures, it begins to grow a small bulb-like structure called a bulbil near the base of its stem, protected by its foliage. The bulbil takes 12 to 18 months to mature, at which point it drops off the parent plant and grows into a mature blood lily within a year. If released on land, a bulbil takes root in the soil, from which it draws sustenance; if released underwater, it drifts with the currents, drawing sustenance from the water as it grows. Blood lilies don't protect their released bulbils; many are consumed by predators, and in areas where hunting is poor, adult blood lilies might even consume their own immature sprouts. If a sprout reaches maturity, it gains the ability to move under its own power and begins to hunt.",
			"",
			"Mature blood lilies can live for decades if hunting remains good and they aren't killed by other predators. A blood lily that survives for at least 10 years sometimes enters a hibernation phase during which its petals fall off and its vines wrap around its trunk, forming a cocoon-like structure. After a season of dormancy, the blood lily sprouts larger, darker petals that carry the same toxin as the thorns in its vines. The blood lily's vines undergo a growth spurt, gaining an extra 5 feet in length. These blood lilies are hardier than their lesser kin and can challenge even the deadliest predators. They have the advanced creature simple template, they add their poison to attacks with their petal spikes, and their reach with slam attacks increases by 5 feet."

			"**Blinding Bloom (Ex)** Once per day as a standard action that doesn't provoke attacks of opportunity, a blood maize plant can release a stationary, 20-foot-high cloud of fine pollen in a 20-foot radius centered on its square. The cloud acts as an {spell/obscuring mist} spell, but it lasts for 1 round, after which it dissipates. A creature in the cloud when the pollen is released or that moves into the cloud before it dissipates must succeed at a DC 13 Fortitude saving throw or be blinded for 1 round. The saving throw DC is Charisma-based.",
			"",
			"**Change Foliage (Su)** Three times per day as an immediate action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity, a blood maize plant can make itself appear as a different type of plant. This new appearance mimics that of any plant up to two size categories smaller than the blood maize and need not resemble the blood maize's true form. For example, the blood maize can take on the semblance of a pumpkin vine, strawberry plant, or sunflower. A blood maize plant's statistics remain the same, even if it is masquerading as a plant of a smaller size category. It can't assume the form of another plant creature and can imitate only the appearance of plants that are normally considered part of the surrounding terrain. This effect is a visual illusion only and does not alter the perceived scent or tactile properties of the blood maize. While using this ability, the blood maize gains a +10 racial bonus on Stealth checks. A successful DC 20 Knowledge (nature) or Survival check is required to identify the plant's true nature. A creature that interacts with a blood maize plant while it is using this ability can disbelieve the illusion with a successful DC 13 Will saving throw. Changing back into its true form requires an immediate action. This is an illusion (glamer) effect. The saving throw DC is Charisma-based.",
			"",
			"**Root Deep (Ex)** As a free action that doesn't provoke attacks of opportunity, a blood maize plant can use its long hooklike appendage to root itself deep into dirt or soil, but not into rock or other harder materials. This grants the blood maize a +4 racial bonus against bull rush or trip attempts.",
			"",
			"#### Description",
			"",
			"Named not for their physical coloration but for their thirst for spilled blood, the plants known as blood maize plants are insidious creatures. They look like common cornstalks, except their leaves are larger and more knifelike and their root systems are much more robust and mobile. In each specimen, the latter includes at least one long vine-like tendril that the plant can use to root itself deeply in the earth as it attacks its victim. Despite its fearsome nature, blood maize produces ears of sweet corn larger than those of traditional corn plants. A full-grown blood maize stalk is typically 7 feet tall and, including its root system, weighs about 70 pounds.",
			"",
			"### Ecology",
			"",
			"It's said that blood maize plants arose spontaneously in ancient times at the sites of great battles, where blood pooled like rainwater and the plains were covered in broken bodies. In these legends, crops left to wither and rot due to raging wars adapted to their harsh new environs via a mixture of natural hardiness and the latent energies of suffering that permeated the land. The results were the first blood maize. Sustenance would not come to the blood maize, and so the plants developed a way to hunt down their own nourishment, and the blood that once choked their roots instead became their food. Many believe blood maize is evil due to its affinity for blood and the plant's eerie ambulatory nature. However, despite its purported origin story, blood maize is actually unmotivated by anything other than the need for nourishment, albeit via a strange biology born from its dark origins.",
			"",
			"While the uninformed often associate blood maize with vampires and other blood-drinking creatures, the plants don't actually drink blood or grapple enemies to drain them. Rather, they instinctually seek to slice the skin of victims; any creatures that bleed are potential prey, though they most commonly stalk humanoids. Blood maize plants slice their prey with their large, sharp leaves, which peel away from their stalks to serve as appendages. These leaves are durable and can stiffen, and the edges are razor sharp. When a blood maize stalk strikes a victim, it roots into place while its leaves lash outward and slice into the victim's flesh. Blood maize plants absorb spilled blood through their root systems and can do so even while they are mobile. To aid their search for blood, they can uproot themselves to move without impediment, and they can use their roots to dig a firm purchase in the ground. Blood maize can both see and sense movement remarkably well; the plants migrate and search for food at night, and so they are finely attuned to the ground vibrations they use to locate prey.",
			"",
			"Although blood maize stalks that haven't fed in days or weeks are tenacious in combat, these plants often try to withdraw from a fight once they've sliced one or more victims to death. When their thirst has been sated, they use their defensive abilities to avoid further violence, though this is more of an instinct for self-preservation than an actual desire to avoid a fight. Foremost among these defensive measures is the blood maize's ability to release a pollen cloud, which allows the plant to retreat from a battle while its enemies are distracted. This cloud is dense enough to block sight for a moment, and though the pollen dissipates quickly, creatures that get it in their eyes discover that it stings painfully. Once its enemies are distracted, a blood maize stalk disguises itself as an innocuous environmental plant in the hope that its enemies will leave the area and not discover the ruse.",
			"",
			"Blood maize plants are perennial, and they are reduced to only their root structures during the winter. They regrow their stalks as well as their sweet corn cobs in the spring, and maintain this form throughout the fall. They reproduce only once in their life cycles through a special red kernel produced on one cob, usually in the plant's second year. The other cobs produce normal corn, which is not only safe to eat, but delicious and wholesome. In fact, some hardy frontier homesteaders or settlements prize this corn as a delicacy and mount regular, if perilous, missions to harvest it. Blood maize plants typically live for 4 or 5 years, but there are reports of some in remote locations that reproduce each year and live for a decade or more.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"Blood maize plants are found in temperate climates. They are wild plants, but they tend to grow most robustly in rural areas, likely due to the abundance of prey that surrounds them there. Blood maize plants are attracted to gardens and farms, as the stalks can relocate easily in tilled soil and find that birds, livestock, and unsuspecting humans make for relatively easy meal sources. Farmers who don't care to harvest blood maize's corn consider it a dangerous pest, while evil-inclined druids and witch covens sometimes use blood maize to protect gardens and thickets where rare alchemical and spell components are grown. Of course, these villainous gardeners can't control the plants' bloodlust; if they drop their guard around the stalks, they often find themselves fending off razor-sharp leaves.",
			"",
			"Blood maize is rare in the Inner Sea region, but it's more frequently found in Arcadia as well as occasionally on the surviving islands from the shattered continent of Azlant. One account from Vudra describes similarly mobile plant creatures that resemble bamboo but are as bloodthirsty as their blood maize cousins."

Any kuru linked to in this way must succeed at a DC 28 Will save or be forced to carry out the Blood Queen's telepathic commands to the best of its ability. In addition, a linked kuru gains a +4 morale bonus to Strength and Constitution and is immune to mind-affecting effects.

			"",
			"**Surrogate Senses (Su)** In addition to its blindsight, the Blood Queen can constantly see and hear through its unholy kuru surrogates as though with a permanent clairaudience/clairvoyance spell. If at any time one of the Blood Queen's surrogates is killed, it is dazed for 1 round.",
			"",
			"**Unholy Gestation (Ex)** Whenever the Blood Queen swallows an unconscious humanoid or renders a humanoid unconscious with its swallow whole ability, it moves the victim through its digestive track, where the victim no longer takes damage, but rather begins to gestate within the Blood Queen's transformative stomach for 1d4 rounds. After the creature has finished gestating, it is regurgitated from the hindquarters of the Blood Queen, encased in an opaque mucous pod. Any attempt to remove a gestated humanoid from its pod causes massive system shock, and the humanoid takes 6d6 points of damage unless it succeeds at a DC 25 Fortitude save or those releasing it succeed at a DC 25 Heal check. As a swift action, the Blood Queen can send strong telepathic emanations to any pod within 100 feet, causing it to violently explode. The resulting spray of bilious ooze deals 6d6 points of acid damage to the creature encased in the pod and to any creatures in a 15-foot-radius burst. ",
			"",
			"Alternatively, the Blood Queen may allow an encased humanoid to continue to gestate for at least 24 hours, and after that duration may release the fully metamorphosed creature from its pod at any point. When released, the victim completes its transformation into a kuru surrogate (see the Kuru Surrogate section below). The Blood Queen may create any number of pods, but can only possess up to six kuru surrogates at any one time (if the Blood Queen releases a seventh kuru surrogate from its mucus pod, the oldest surrogate immediately dies no matter where it is and the Blood Queen is dazed for 1 round). The save DCs are Constitution-based.",

			"#### Description",
			"",
			"Millennia ago, when the repugnant cyclops empire of Ghol-Gan populated the Shackles, its foul and alien gods sent powerful servants from beyond to act as their intermediaries, guiding and corrupting the empire until its ignominious collapse, at which point the gods and their minions fled Golarion altogether. However, one of these vile servants remained even after Ghol-Gan's collapse, a wretched horror known as the Blood Queen. It has dwelt for centuries in its foul subterranean chamber in a ruined Ghol-Gan temple called Ganagsau in the Cannibal Isles, and it was this blasphemous being who transformed the kuru into the degenerate race they are today, convincing them that it is a living goddess worthy of their veneration. The Blood Queen has a kuru high priest who goes by the name Bukrugsor, and this devoted thrall sees to it that his dark patron is brought regular sacrificial victims and offerings of blood.",
			"",
			"The Blood Queen has no eyes, per se - rather, what look like angry pustules all over its bloated body act as sensory organs. In addition, it is able to see and hear the world through the various kuru surrogates its followers have interspersed throughout the Cannibal Isles. Its grotesque mouth is capable of articulating a number of languages, though if it deigns to speak with a creature it usually does so via its telepathy. While the Blood Queen uses the short tentacles that extend from its mouth to devour prey and sacrificial offerings, the tentacles that emanate from its hindquarters are long, muscular, and tipped with bonelike stingers that allow it to manipulate objects and electrify victims.",
			"",
			"The Blood Queen is nearly immobile, being a massive, swollen beast that sits in the middle of a huge underground temple chamber in its ruined cathedral. While it may slowly undulate its bulk in one direction or another, in the years since its appearance on Golarion, the Blood Queen has grown far too large to fit through any of the limestone chamber's exits. Only the Blood Queen's high priest, those destined to become surrogate kuru, or sacrifices to the behemoth monster are allowed within this foul throne room. Sometimes unwilling sacrifices are dropped into the chamber from a hole in the ceiling and the exits are sealed so that the Blood Queen may toy with its food before it feeds. A being of monumental evil, the Blood Queen expresses its rage at its divine abandonment by spreading as much pain and havoc as it can. Whether it ever escapes its ancient, self-made prison remains to be seen, though all right-thinking creatures that know of its existence shudder at the prospect.",
			"",
			"### Kuru Surrogates",
			"",
			"The Blood Queen's favored deacons are known as kuru surrogates, and such monstrosities are created when the horror digests a creature and entombs the victim in one of its paralytic sacs for long enough. The creature that emerges is essentially brain-dead, having been completely stripped of its wits and nervous system. A kuru surrogate remains in its vegetative state until it starves, is killed, or is affected by a heal spell or a similar effect of equal or greater power. Kuru surrogates are revered among the Blood Queen's devout, who transport the immobile things around the Cannibal Isles, perpetually caring for the \"blessed\" individuals. The Blood Queen acts through these surrogates and uses them to augment and command its kuru followers, linking with its minions in order to capture any who oppose it or its wicked cult of cannibals."

Perhaps worse, the crimson parasites carry a debilitating disease known for sapping the vitality of its victims.

Legends describe crimson clouds decimating entire populations on their flight from breeding pool to jungle interior. Only high winds, drought, and torrential rain consistently keep them at bay. Thankfully, the swarms also wax and wane with fluctuations in local prey populations. In combination with the mosquitoes' relatively short lifespan, competition for food helps keep their numbers under marginal control.",

			"**Awlspines (Ex)** Once per minute as a standard action, a bloodplate burster can supercharge its circulatory system to forcefully project keratinous dorsal spines, dealing 6d10 points of piercing damage to adjacent creatures (Reflex DC 20 half) and applying its hydraulic surge ability to creatures that take damage from the attack. Mud, soil, and similar materials do not block line of effect or provide cover from awlspines. When burrowing as a move action, a bloodplate burster can make an awlspines attack at any point during the move. The save DC is Constitution-based.",
			"",
			"**Hydraulic Surge (Ex)** A bloodplate burster that deals damage to a target with an awlspines attack or a tentacle attack forces pressurized fluids into its prey, dealing 2d8 additional points of acid damage and sickening the target for 1d4 rounds (Fortitude DC 20 negates). Further applications of this effect extend its duration. The save DC is Constitution-based.",
			"",
			"**Rupture (Ex)** A bloodplate burster's hydraulic assault can raise its prey's internal pressure to catastrophic levels. Creatures slain by the bloodplate burster's hydraulic surge ability explode, dealing 3d8 points of acid damage (Reflex DC 20 half) to other creatures within a 15-foot-radius burst of the slain creature. The save DC is Constitution-based.",
			"",
			"#### Description",
			"",
			"Fearsome subterranean predators, bloodplate bursters are naturally armored rhizomes that resemble long and tapered ginger roots. A hunting adult's bulbous back is covered by shingled layers of withered, spade-shaped leaves. Thick sheets of fibrous growth coat its lower body, from which sprout hundreds of pale, finger-width cilia. Vines like the rigging of a ship run from its sightless \"head\" toward its posterior, and fist-sized stomata peek from leaves and appendages across its form.",
			"",
			"Bloodplate bursters are known for their sudden, terrifying appearances. The first sign of a burster is often a pack animal's panicked cry. The monster's hissing emergence is usually followed shortly by its target's viscerally explosive death.",
			"",
			"An average adult bloodplate burster is over 6 feet tall and 12 feet long and weighs around 6,000 pounds.",
			"",
			"Bloodplate bursters are ruthless predators at the top of their food chain. Acidic secretions allow quiet, cilia-driven passage through softened earth while the plants use their keen senses to assess the size and health of prey and threats from underneath the ground's surface. A bloodplate burster's lateral sensory nodes pick up vibration in a wide swath around it as it burrows, and its olfactory system is highly attuned to the smell of blood-injured prey attract particular attention, and a burster generally tracks and isolates the largest possible meal that is the easiest kill.",
			"",
			"The plant maintains a complex internal system of pressurized caustic fluid, regulated by an internal gas bladder that aids in circulating the acid through numerous stomata. This exchange produces a constant, characteristic hissing that intensifies when the bloodplate burster first attacks its prey. In a wet, sibilant rush, the bladder can exert tremendous hydraulic force to push thick spines through the burster's opened dorsal stomata. The spines pierce flesh to inject pressurized fluid whose caustic nature cauterizes the wounds, causing pressure to build in the victim's body. The burster then surfaces to lash prey with its thick lateral vines. When brought into forceful contact, the vines' reinforced stomata adhere to flesh and inject further bursts of fluid that build up excruciating pressure over repeated blows. The burster relentlessly strikes its prey with its vines until its barrage of spines drives the victim's internal pressure to uncontainable levels and the victim explodes in a shower of gore and shredded flesh.",
			"",
			"With its hunt complete, the massive plant settles into the ground beneath its kill to feed. The absorbed blood turns the burster's dozens of dry armored plates into ballooning leaves that remain above the soil and absorb the sun's rays, aiding the creature's metabolization.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"While most bloodplate bursters dwell on the Whistling Plains of Taldor's eastern border, the itinerant plants prowl deserts and grasslands throughout southeastern Avistan and western Casmaron. Vigilant shepherds, trade caravans, and army patrols - especially those mounted on heavy-footed elephants - listen carefully for bursters' trademark hissing and look for knee-high clusters of glistening ruby fins.",
			"",
			"Though rightly feared, these creatures are infrequently encountered. Ingesting a kill's blood is a months-long process during which a bloodplate burster remains dormant unless roused. Its vital fluids are more caustic while feeding, but it exudes moisture and warmth. These secondary effects of blood metabolization can even make the burster the center of a temporary microclimate: birds adapted to its acidity feed on its engorged leaves, and the seeds they carry sprout into plants and wildflowers that attract other organisms' soon, what began as a blood-soaked graveyard flourishes with new life. Even in death, a burster becomes a home for other creatures as rodents carve dwellings from the remnants of its fibrous husk.",
			"",
			"When not hunting or feeding, these territorial beings patrol their expansive holdings. They mark their perimeters with boluses of acid deposited in the soil. The enzymatic compositions of these clusters repel other bursters, and the slightest vibration near a marker triggers a seismic signal. Bursters react to this information according to their hunger or territorial need. Two juveniles may share territory thanks to a tacit instinctual agreement, or an elder burster may repel a younger creature's invasion. Those too weak to defend their territory use their flagging blood reserves to bud the next generation; the resulting dog-sized offspring consume the organisms attracted to the senescent burster.",
			"",
			"Some daring opportunists find good reason to risk their lives with the aggressive plants; the creatures' untriggered perimeter markers eventually condense into pearlescent ovoids with supposedly wondrous properties, and the singular composition of bursters' plated leaves makes them well suited for use in crafting armor and durable textiles.",
			"",
			"Despite a bloodplate burster's solitary, territorial disposition, travelers have occasionally had no choice but to face multiple bursters at once. The seismic disturbance of a marching army, wagon train, or herd of migrating beasts can provoke multiple bursters, leading to the formation of a temporary, semi-coordinated pack. Ashen-faced traders speak of hundreds of bison torn apart in a frenzy of cresting plants and rupturing hide, leaving clouds of bloody mist drifting for miles on prairie winds.",
			"",
			"### Bloodplate Burster Variant",
			"",
			"While a bloodplate burster is hunting, its scalelike leaves serve as armor, but the plant's natural causticity is reduced. However, once a burster has set to feeding, its leaves expand and fill with its internal corrosive enzymes. A feeding bloodplate burster has only half its usual natural armor bonus, and the DCs of its hydraulic surge and rupture abilities are reduced by 2. A feeding burster also gains fast healing 2, and creatures that hit it with natural attacks or unarmed attacks take 2d6 points of acid damage."

Sometimes, children whom they steal away to secret lairs emerge years later, transformed into new bogeymen, and return home to continue their supernatural father's work."

			"Malicious and furtive, boggarts are believed to be brownies that were mistreated or somehow corrupted. Unlike brownies, who sometimes form mutually beneficial relationships with particular families and take up residence within those families' houses, boggarts rarely occupy homes. Instead, they lurk in swamps, in marshes, and on riverbanks, favoring areas where people have vanished or drowned. A boggart's relationship with nearby households and homesteads is almost always disruptive. It frightens livestock and breaks valuable objects, and even goes so far as to follow victims who move their households in an attempt to escape their tormentor. Despite these habits, boggarts rarely cause serious harm to their chosen families, preferring simply to sow fear and misery. Even though these relationships are characterized by animosity, they seem to stabilize the boggarts somewhat. Boggarts that lack households to terrorize are far less benign.",
			"",
			"A boggart is rarely spotted unless it wishes to be seen, and it has little interest in fighting fair. When preying on its victims, a boggart uses its familiarity with its home terrain to its advantage, preferring to induce foes to struggle against the natural environment rather than against the boggart. A boggart has very long arms, which it uses to pull creatures into water or onto marshy ground; it then psychically paralyzes its victims and allows the creatures to drown. A boggart is also quite skilled at setting traps and dragging its opponents into them. It sometimes uses aversion to keep people away from its home, but more often uses this power to prevent anyone from helping its chosen prey.",
			"",
			"A boggart's magic is drawn from the excess psychic energy in an area. Boggarts cause mischief in order to heighten negative emotions near their homes and thus fuel their powers. It has been theorized that if a boggart were isolated from such energy for long enough, it could eventually revert into a brownie.",
			"",
			"A typical boggart stands 3 feet tall and weighs 70 pounds."

			"These enormous bovines are 15 feet tall, measure nearly 30 feet from horns to tail, and weigh approximately 16 tons. Bred for war and violence by the Murdered Child orc tribe, they are used in ravine fights - bloodsports in blocked-off gorges or gullies that pit the might and ferocity of orcs against various wild beasts. Aggressive and trained for combat, bulls of Zagresh respond to most threats by charging anything that stands and goring whatever is left. Skilled Murdered Child beast drovers oversee bulls of Zagresh in warfare, driving the mighty cattle into enemy formations to break the front line or crush foot archers and other lightly armored targets."

			"Warcats of Rull are massive creatures with the shapes and habits of great cats but the armored skin of armadillos. Weighing 4,000 pounds and stretching 25 feet from nose to the base of its tail, a warcat of Rull is a dangerous predator with a large territory. Wild warcats of Rull hunt alone or with a single mate, and have been known to take down prey ranging from megafauna to giants and even young dragons. The Ice Tooth orc clan catches warcats of Rull as cubs and trains them to serve the clan. These beasts often act as mounts for the clan's champions, who ride them into battle against warriors from the Realm of the Mammoth Lords."
