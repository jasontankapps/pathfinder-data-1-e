			"While some martial arts traditions focus on the strength of the body, most schools of combat and self-defense know the importance of using weapons as well. Brawling blademaster samurai use weapon strikes and unarmed attacks in equal measure-foes expecting to defend themselves against a dagger or a sword are often caught off guard by a brawling blademaster's brutal kicks or punches.",

This replaces weapon expertise.",
			"",
			"**Harmonious Flow (Ex):** At 4th level, the brawling blademaster becomes skilled at combining weapon attacks and unarmed strikes into a harmonious combat style. When attacking the target of her challenge, the brawling blademaster doesn't take the usual -2 penalty on attack rolls associated with attacking with two weapons if her main-hand weapon is a light or one-handed manufactured weapon and her off-hand weapon is an unarmed strike (or vice versa). While she's using this ability, one of her hands must be empty even if she uses another body part to make an unarmed strike.",

An ironbound sword can use any weapon to deal nonlethal damage without taking the normal -4 penalty on attack rolls.

Each round on its turn, the unconscious target can attempt a new saving throw to end the effect as a full-round action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity.

Whenever the ironbound sword takes a full defense action, she can expend an attack of opportunity to attempt to counter melee attacks made against her. This counter is a single attack roll at the ironbound blade's full base attack bonus that resolves before the enemy's attack. If the counter successfully hits the attacking enemy's AC and if the ironbound sword's attack roll is higher than the attacking creature's attack roll, the ironbound sword takes no damage from the enemy's attack and can initiate a disarm combat maneuver against the attacking enemy as a free action. If the triggering attack was made with a natural attack or unarmed strike, a successful disarm combat maneuver renders that natural attack or unarmed strike unusable until the victim spends a standard action to reset dislocated joints. In addition, the ironbound sword can spend one use of her resolve when she hits with a nonlethal attack to initiate a disarm combat maneuver against her target as a free action.",
