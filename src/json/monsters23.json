			"Targothas are unusual creatures that thrive in the thick, inky fluids of naturally occurring tar seeps or pits of oil, although they are equally at home in swampy waters or muddy bogs. They depend upon their blindsense when lurking within opaque fluids like tar or ooze, and will even lurch out of their lairs and flop along the ground if necessary to pursue a meal. A targotha is a patient ambush predator, and without the need to breathe, it can lie in wait for weeks for food.",

			"A typical targotha measures 30 feet in length and weighs 7,000 pounds. Larger specimens are known to exist, but they prefer to dwell far from areas inhabited by civilized folk in the largest and deepest of tar pits or fens.

The target must be within 10 feet of the tatterlorn, and can resist being isolated with a successful DC 20 Will save. Regardless of the saving throw, a single creature can only be targeted by this effect once every 24 hours. Isolation persists for 1 minute, during which time the isolated creature treats all other creatures as if they had the tatterlorn's forsaken ability, and all living creatures treat the isolated character in the same manner. An isolated creature cannot take the aid another action, nor can it benefit from this action. Worse, an isolated creature becomes nearly overwhelmed with sensations of loneliness and neglect, and becomes increasingly convinced it is without purpose in the world. This causes a creature to take a -4 penalty on all attack rolls, skill checks, ability checks, and Will saving throws. This effect of isolate is a mind-affecting effect, but all other effects are not. The save DC is Charisma-based.",

			"Tatterlorns spawn as a result of slow, preventable deaths witnessed by multiple indifferent onlookers. Given these circumstances, tatterlorns are most often found in large cities, especially in nations such as Cheliax, Katapesh, or Nidal. In these places, the urban poor can succumb to starvation or exposure on the street while passersby pretend not to notice. As they were ignored and invisible in life, so they are in death. The eyes of living creatures subconsciously refuse to linger on a tatterlorn, making direct observation almost impossible. This is not true invisibility, however, and a tatterlorn can be seen in peripheral vision.",
			"",
			"Filled with rage at their unnecessary deaths and at the callousness of the living, tatterlorns stalk the areas where they died, looking for lone victims. They rarely kill in combat, preferring to subdue victims and keep them somewhere to watch them starve or succumb to the elements. When faced with multiple dangerous opponents, tatterlorns prefer to use their isolate ability on physically weak enemies before employing hit-and-run tactics.",
			"",
			"Most disturbing of all are the unexpected relationships that form when tatterlorns encounter attic whisperers. Seeing [attic whisperers](monster/attic_whisperer) as kindred spirits, tatterlorns sometimes create unholy families with these undead children, sharing lairs in abandoned buildings or sewers. A tatterlorn multiplies through the abduction of children, whom it transforms into attic whisperers to assuage its unending loneliness, often causing mass hysteria in cities as children go missing. Tatterlorns heading larger families sometimes advance by taking class levels in rogue, becoming devastating combatants."

Fiercely loyal and protective of its ward, a tattoo guardian leaves its wearer's skin to fight any who would harm her. Tattoo guardians are common in the courts of Tian Xia, where wealthy courtiers pay kings' ransoms for protection against assassins hired by their rivals, and in Varisia, where the arts of tattooing and magic have long intertwined. Certain Garundi arcane universities are known to provide senior students of summoning and other dangerous fields of magic with vigilant tattoos to protect them from accidental harm. Temples of virtuous deities might also ink guardians upon the skins of high-level clergy such as healers or prophets who are not skilled in battle magic. Such tattoo guardians often use the iconography of the religion for their forms: a revered Sarenite healer might be adorned with a fiery phoenix that flares into life if she is threatened, while a Caydenite cleric especially skilled in brewing libations might bear a cayhound across his shoulders.",
			"",
			"The ink used in the construction of a tattoo guardian is amorphous, able to change shape and harden to become as sharp and solid as steel. Should its wearer be threatened, the guardian withdraws its ink from the wearer's flesh and hardens it into a thin blade, then rises from the wearer's skin to interpose itself between her and her attackers. Even though a tattoo guardian can completely separate itself from its wearer, it rarely strays far from her, even in the midst of battle.",
			"",
			"The guardian and its wearer share a magical bond; should it fail in its duty, a tattoo guardian typically self-destructs, the once-sentient ink melding with its former master's blood. In rare cases, the guardian might gain some fragment of its dying master's sentience and go out into the world instead. Sadly, most of these creatures are driven completely insane by the process, and are unable to pursue goals more complicated than revenge against their masters' killers.",

An adult tatzlwyrm is 6 to 8 feet long, including its winding, organless tail, and it weighs between 400 and 500 pounds. A tatzlwyrm's scales give the creature limited camouflage, ranging through various shades of green, brown, and gray.",

A tauhoti can remember the scent and appearance of hundreds of animals, and it recalls which ones have taken or given it food. The following season, the tauhoti watches for its debtors, at first chirping at them and then nipping them until they provide some repayment. Some birds and mammals maintain mutual relationships with tauhotis, bringing them offerings of hard-to-access food either in exchange for something else the tauhoti has or to gain the rodent's assistance in burying a morsel for later. Tauhotis' mercantile habits are endearing to most Drumans.

			"Taxidermic creatures are the work of obsessed individuals seeking to use their alchemical or occult talents to preserve and reanimate lifeless beings. The abilities of taxidermic creatures often pale in comparison to those of their living counterparts, as they are bereft of intelligence or an animate life force to guide them. Instead, taxidermic creatures possess a rudimentary form of instinct, though they are still able to follow basic instructions from their creators.",
			"",
			"Less refined than the magic used to animate undead, golems, and other constructs, the creation of a taxidermic creature is at best an inaccurate science. There is no one method of crafting a taxidermic creature, so each result is different. Every creature crafted in such a manner is prone to inherent defects based on the materials used or shortcuts taken during the process, and may or may not be able to obey its creators commands in a satisfactory manner. Because of taxidermic creatures' limited mental faculties, their creators must be extremely careful and literal when commanding them.",
			"",
			"Left unattended, taxidermic creatures stand in place, having no need to drink, eat, or sleep. Unless given specific commands, the actions of these creatures are unpredictable. Each taxidermic creature behaves differently, depending on the quirks of its individual construction. Some taxidermic creatures move and act like prowling animals, while others move with the rigidity and unerring purpose of animated objects. Some twisted taxidermists have gone so far as to create taxidermic humanoids, aberrations, and even fey."

This organ must either be magically preserved or come from a creature that is alive or has been dead no longer than 3 days. Only one organ may be harvested from each body; all others are destroyed in the process as the tekenu rips the body apart. Each organ consumed grants the tekenu a unique ability listed below. When discovered, a tekenu typically has 1d4 of the following abilities, each corresponding to the most recent organs the creature absorbed. Even when the creature has absorbed all four organs (thus gaining a full suite of abilities), it still hungers for more. The challenge rating of a tekenu that possesses all four canopic organs increases by 1.",

			"- Liver: The tekenu's slam attacks deal 1d3 points of Constitution damage to any living creature that fails a DC 17 Fortitude save. This is a poison effect, and the save DC is Charisma-based.",
			"- Lungs: As a standard action, the tekenu can expel most of the air and moisture from its form, turning into a pile of desiccated viscera. While in this form, the tekenu gains a +8 racial bonus on Stealth checks, and its fly speed increases to 60 feet with good maneuverability. It can revert to its normal form as a free action.",

			"",

The creature is not subject to critical hits or flanking, and it is immune to any spell or effect that targets a specific number of creatures (including single-target spells such as disintegrate).",
			"",
			"**Vulnerable to Channeled Energy (Ex)** A tekenu takes 150% as much damage as normal from channeled positive energy.",
			"",
			"#### Description",
			"",
			"Guardians of long-abandoned tombs, tekenu are the result of a vile practice that instills the discarded piles of flesh left over from the mummification process with an unholy awareness. Separated from the sacred organs placed in canopic jars, tekenus attempt to reconnect with their counterparts among the living by killing creatures so that they can absorb intestines, livers, lungs, and stomachs into their squirming forms-a process that grants the undead creature additional powers.",
			"",
			"Tekenus have been known to hide inside canopic jars collected from excavations (cleverly pulling the lid closed), attacking passersby like a trapdoor spider. Adventurers searching through lost reliquaries and tombs of ancient Osirion commonly call these foul creatures \"gutswarms\"; however, the name scholars give them is derived from an ancient Osirian term for the cast off remains of mummification rituals. A tekenu has an ever-changing form roughly 3 feet long and 2 feet wide, essentially the size of a robust humanoid's torso and abdomen. The mass weighs about 40 pounds.",
			"",
			"Scholars debate the genesis of the tekenu. Some propose these atrocities are the creations of sects of evil priests in ancient Osirion, as they have been encountered only in tombs in that nation and of that era. However, several groups claim responsibility for the creation of the tekenu, including modern cults of Kabriri and Urgathoa. More cautious and traditional scholars claim that the tekenu are instead undead abominations resulting from improperly conducted mummification rituals, specifically ones in which the incision to remove organs was performed by a criminal or laborer.",
			"",
			"The viscera that constitute a tekenu make it less susceptible to weapon damage and provide it with defensive abilities similar to those of swarms. In fact, until a tekenu absorbs one of the sacred canopic organs, it poses no stronger a threat than that of a swarm of Tiny vermin. The absorption of a sacred organ, however, prompts a radical transformation in the tekenu. Only fresh organs or those preserved by magic enhance the tekenu in this way. Unearthed tekenu have typically consumed one or two organs, normally those belonging to laborers trapped in the tomb at the time it was sealed.",
			"",
			"Intestines merge with the discarded remnants to act as long, rope-like appendages, which the tekenu uses to snag and pummel prey. Consuming a liver allows the tekenu to poison its victims and wither their bodies. A set of lungs gives the swarm the ability to hide as a pile of dried gore and increases its mobility. When the tekenu consumes a stomach, its attacks carry a digestive acid to help break down their victims. Of these organs, the tekenu shows particular affinity for absorbing the lungs first, as most adventurers discover a tekenu after being deceived by desiccated viscera they assume to be harmless.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"Created in ritual chambers and tombs, most tekenus have no choice of where they are found. Only the most perverse of ancient nobility would have tekenu present in their final resting places. In the most heinous of cases, tekenu would be stealthily placed into a resting chamber immediately prior to the tomb's sealing. This serves as a final insult to the dead, leaving the undead abomination to break into the holy canopic jars and consume the vital organs within while they were still fresh enough to bestow power. In cases where a tekenu was used as a guardian, a fifth jar was placed inside the tomb to house it.",
			"",
			"In some cases, either because the canopic jars were exceptionally sealed or because they were absent altogether, a tekenu may have none of the abilities granted by its canopic consumption ability. Once its tomb prison is breached (by explorers or some natural calamity), the tekenu becomes a roaming hunter, leaving its lair in search of fresh organs to consume. Acting on base instinct, the creature hunts until it successfully absorbs all four required organs. Upon gathering these absent parts, the tekenu then moves back to the tomb of its creation, where it dutifully guards the site from future intruders. Although a tekenu is barely intelligent, it is drawn to the site of its creation, a lingering result of the ritual that created it.",
			"",
			"A tekenu has no ability to communicate or interact, and its thoughts, if read by some form of magic, are simple and instinctual. As it preys upon only living and recently dead creatures, it often overlooks constructs and undead. Rare necropolises can be found filled with larger groups of these undead creatures, sealed away in remote chambers or allowed to wander the greater complex unopposed. These groups of tekenus-given stewardships by the priests of Ancient Osirion-ignore other tomb guardians, provided they are not living creatures. These tekenus are set to roam the necropolis consuming small rodents and vermin in the same manner a wizard might use an acidic ooze to dispose of waste."

These strange abominations look like a nightmarish fusion of insect, humanoid, and corpse. Telgrodradts have six multi-jointed appendages that they use to skitter about and burrow, as well as four hooked, probing tentacles that act as antennae. A typical telgrodradt stretches 14 feet from head to tail and weighs upward of 2,500 pounds, though larger and smaller specimens do exist.",

			"Thanks to their pallid flesh and stench of decay, telgrodradts are often confused for undead abominations. These strange creatures take damage from the same effects that harm undead, yet as living creatures they need to feed. Telgrodradts can't derive nutrition from the flesh of living creatures, and especially abhor the metallic tang of blood. Instead they consume the rotting meat of the undead to survive. They can eat old corpses, but the creatures gain very little sustenance from bodies not suffused with negative energy. To reliably feed, telgrodradts kill their prey and then raise them as zombies. Most maintain lairs filled with dozens of zombies staggering around in corrals like gruesome livestock. The undead under their control also provide a first line of defense against the countless dangers of the Darklands. A telgrodradt that eats living flesh every day for more than a week begins taking 1 point of Constitution damage each day that it doesn't consume undead flesh.",
			"",
			"Telgrodradts aren't particularly dangerous on their own, but their need to create undead has the potential to threaten the surrounding countryside. They may inadvertently wreak more havoc over long periods of time as they loose track of some of their undead creations or their corrals fail and zombies come streaming forth to the surface, terrorizing nearby settlements.",
			"",
			"Despite their grublike and apparently mindless appearance, telgrodradts are relatively intelligent. They respond well to diplomacy and engage in conversation with those that come across them, but telgrodradts are steadfast in their determination to kill, animate, and feed. They taunt their enemies in combat, explaining in precise detail what they plan to do with their corpses once they are killed.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"Telgrodradts are typically solitary creatures, preferring to keep a herd of zombie thralls as an ever-present food source, but otherwise living alone in dark, remote corners. However, sometimes these creatures group together to create small civilizations belowground. Instead of a community full of trade and entertainment, telgrodradt cities deep beneath the earth are horrorfilled places that resemble massive feedlots, with hundreds of undead creatures corralled in pens awaiting their ultimate fates as meals for their masters. Each aberration marks or brands its \"herd,\" and uses its limited ability to control the undead it personally animates to dig, build, repair, and otherwise handle the drudgery of civilized life. In these groupings, a telgrodradt can also find a ready source of healing, since they can't heal themselves with their own negative energy rays.",
			"",
			"Telgrodradts engage in strange poetry that they write out in the viscera of their victims in meandering, spiraling strings of words chosen seemingly for their tone rather than meaning. This rambling, nihilistic poetry is only semi-permanent, vanishing as the gore dries and flakes away, but some telgrodradts memorize their art and recite it to one another when they meet. Some telgrodradts shout their doom-filled stanzas at their victims while in combat hoping to intimidate their prey.",
			"",
			"Telgrodradts have learned that necromancers find the aberrations' peculiar nature intriguing. When telgrodradts find themselves in the company of creatures of that discipline, they spin stories and obfuscate their natural abilities, secretly enjoying the act of exploiting their companions' ignorance, all the while looking down on the pitiful humanoids who must study or pray to gods to master the power of undeath.",
			"",
			"Living in the Darklands, some telgrodradts ally with other subterranean denizens, especially fellow aberrations such as chokers, mimics, and otyughs. Their taste for flesh and their effortless command of zombies drive away many other Darklands races, however. Ghouls in particular fear telgrodradts-who stalk the undead in their tunnels as delectable treats when the flavor of zombie flesh grows too monotonous-and attempt to drive off the aberrations whenever they encounter them.",
			"",
			"Few, if any, scholarly texts in the Inner Sea region make mention of these creatures. The most reliable account of a telgrodradt comes from the doomed Chelish colony of Canorus. In this report, a force of dark folk, seemingly in league with a telgrodradt and its animated zombies, attacked the fledgling village. Both the telgrodradt and the dark folk lived in a series of caverns beneath the colony. It is unclear whether the attack on Canorus was the agenda of the dark folk or this strange aberration, but zombies ran rampant by the time a group of adventurers happened upon the village. They delved into the darkened, twisting tunnels to stop the threat, but only one member of that exploratory party ever emerged. Wracked with a strange illness, she only lived long enough to report her description of the telgrodradt to the few remaining villagers, and rose a day after her passing as a ravenous undead. After these events resulted in the slaughter of dozens in Canorus, many of the surviving villagers relocated south to Anchor's End, taking with them horror stories of the \"Canorus Grub.\""

			"A tendriculos is a creature brought into being through a corruption of nature, often where foul magic has seeped into the environs for many years, or where the boundaries between the Material Plane and the mysterious realm of the fey have worn thin. Tales and myths speak of arcane manipulation from other planes, while others speak of a tendriculos as being the manifestation of an angered spirit of nature.",
			"",
			"A voracious carnivore, the tendriculos is an active hunter when it needs to be but it prefers to rely on ambush tactics, choosing well-traveled areas in the forest where it can lie in wait in the undergrowth. The creature is quick to swallow any prey it happens to catch in its vines, relying upon the acid-filled reservoir in its trunk to finish off prey that may still have a bit of fight left in it. This acid not only consumes organic material with shocking ease, but also contains a powerful paralytic enzyme that further reduces a creature's chance of escape once it's been gulped down by the plant.",
			"",
			"Although incapable of speech itself, the tendriculos generally understands a handful of words in a single language (usually Sylvan). While they tend to see all smaller creatures as nothing more than food, tales exist of certain creatures, particularly fey or druids, having secured a sort of alliance with local tendriculoses. In such cases, the tendriculos is more than willing to serve its ally as a guardian, so long as the ally is diligent at providing the plant with a regular supply of food.",
			"",
			"The fact that a tendriculos displays a curious mix of plant, fungal, and even animal traits (in the form of its almost fleshy, toothed maw) has long intrigued sages. That the creature is a plant is firmly established, yet it lays egg-like spheres when the need to reproduce strikes. These \"eggs\" are in fact massive, puffball-like fungi filled with spores-when jostled, the cloud of spores that is released can carry for miles, ensuring that a single tendriculos can seed a huge territory.",

[Xulgaths](monster/xulgath) are the only known creatures that can safely disturb a tenebrous blight's spores-a sideeffect of the reptilian humanoids' psychogenic secretions. Xulgaths often use tenebrous blights as guardians and obstacles to impede trespassers in their territory. Tenebrous blights are 25 feet tall and weigh 4,000 pounds."

A native of the Plane of Shadow, a tenebrous worm hatches from the body of an unfortunate creature that has been implanted with an egg by a gloomwing. The tenebrous worm is fully grown upon hatching, and immediately begins to scour its environs for flesh to consume.",
			"",
			"Although the tenebrous worm tends to be relatively pale-colored, its internal organs seethe and roil with shadowy energies and dark fluids. As the creature feeds, these shadowy innards begin to grow out of its body, forming strange bristle-like filaments of semi-solid shadowstuff not only capable of piercing the flesh of those who would attack the worm, but also possessing a deadly paralytic poison. Additional shadowy fluids constantly seep from the worm's mandibles-when it bites prey, these fluids melt flesh into shadows that the creature can then consume. When a tenebrous worm feeds on enough of this shadowy flesh, the creature seeks out a secluded, shady area (typically just within a cave entrance or in a ruined building) and spins a shadowy cocoon around itself. A tenebrous worm's cocoon exudes the effects of a darkness spell (CL 8th), muting the surrounding light. After a period of several days, the cocoon tears open and a fully grown gloomwing emerges, ready to seek a host for its eggs."

They avoid attacking groups that heavily outnumber them, preferring to patiently track potential prey and strike when they can take victims one at a time.",

They typically rotate their hunting grounds and try to cover their tracks when farmers organize to defend their lands or locate the tenomes' lairs.

			"Tentamorts are eerie ambush predators, preferring to let prey come to them rather than seeking food out, and relying on their excellent senses to warn them of approaching meals. A tentamort possesses several tentacles, most of which are used for locomotion but two of which have evolved for singular purposes in securing food. One of these longer tentacles is covered with tiny, sticky nodules and is capable of constricting prey, while the other ends in a long, thin stinger. The tentamort's method of attack is to grab its prey with its constricting tentacle and sting the grappled target with the other. Tentamort poison is particularly horrific, as it swiftly liquefies the creature's internal organs into a rancid slurry the monster can then drink with the same stinger, siphoning out the fluid with foul sucking sounds. Larger creatures often require multiple stings (and multiple failed saving throws against the venom) before they can be fully absorbed by a tentamort. Tentamorts are almost mindless, possessing just enough intellect to make crude animal judgments about peril and food. Once a tentamort has grabbed prey, it tends to focus entirely on that creature, ignoring attacks upon it from other sources as long as its current victim remains a source of nutrition. After a tentamort finishes consuming a creature, all that typically remains are the bones and skin.",
			"",
			"A well-fed tentamort uses the hollow corpse of its meal as a sort of incubator for its eggs, injecting the body with a caviar-like mass of black eggs that mature in the rotting carcass for several weeks until a dozen or so hand-sized tentamorts hatch and crawl out of their host's orifices. Depending upon the availability of other prey, anywhere from one to six of these may survive, feeding on rats and Tiny vermin, until they eventually grow to adulthood. Tentamort young look like dark blue starfish with a single red eye in the center-they do not possess their longer, specialized tentacles until they mature. A young tentamort often attaches itself to a larger predator, clinging to it much the same way a remora clings to a shark, dropping off to feed innocuously on its host's kills while the creature sleeps.",
			"",
			"Some tentamorts grow much larger than their human-sized kin. Known as greater tentamorts, these ogre-sized creatures have at least 10 Hit Dice and are Large sized. Their two specialized tentacles grow to 20 feet long, providing the creature with greater reach than a Large monster normally possesses. Greater tentamorts are never found in groups, for these creatures can only achieve such monstrous size through cannibalism, as if there were some key nutrient in another tentamort's body that allows them to exceed their typical physical limitations. Some of these creatures have mutations giving them two tentacles and two stingers. Yet the most disturbing quality possessed by these monsters is their unexpected intellect-greater tentamorts are often as intelligent as humans, or more so. They cannot speak, but possess an eerie form of telepathy that works only upon creatures they are in physical contact with-a feature they often use to \"chat\" with their food as they eat."

			"",
			"#### Description",
			"",
			"A terrifying mix of prehistoric arthropod and heavily armored mantis, the tetrolimulus is the stuff of nightmares for shipwrecked and abandoned mariners. Plated with a spiny crustacean exoskeleton, the upper body of the tetrolimulus is reminiscent of a very robust kind of mantis. Its raptorial forelimbs, folded as if in prayer, flash forward with frightening speed and precision to brutally slice opponents before they have had a chance to act. Captains and mutineers alike are quick to remind their enemies of these deadly claws and the creature's other name, the \"beach guillotine,\" for the brutal justice it exacts on those put ashore for choosing the wrong side in a mutiny.",
			"",
			"With somewhat less panache, the tetrolimulus is often described as the \"sea-mantis\" because it resembles a crab's strong legs and shell merged with a mantis' powerful arms. Trailing behind is a scorpion's deadly stinger. The creature's durable, spiked shell covers five pairs of blade-like legs that work together to produce remarkable speeds even through challenging terrain. Truly a master of the beaches, the tetrolimulus has caught many mariners off guard with a blazing charge over varied terrain, perforating a noiseless trail through wet sand, then clattering over rocks with the sound of dice thrown across a table.",
			"",
			"Its final and most dangerous terror, held upright and waved like a regal scepter in combat, is the tetrolimulus's tail stinger. The stinger is razor sharp along its outer edge, but its neat incisions are nowhere near as dangerous as the poison that coats its blade. Those who succumb to a dose of poison-called tetrodotoxin-are soon to be a meal for the sea-mantis. Muscle spasms and cramps accompany a gradual slowing of movement, hinting at oncoming paralysis and the agony of a neat butchering while still alive for easy consumption. One of nature's cruelest poisons, tetrodotoxin is a popular tool of the [Red Mantis](rule/aff_assassins) assassins, who appreciate both the poison's painful efficacy and the mantis-form of its progenitor.",
			"",
			"### Ecology",
			"",
			"Out of the water, the tetrolimulus adopts an unusual swaying movement of the upper body. Although its purpose is not entirely clear, it is thought that, much like the land-dwelling mantis, the movement enhances the creature's primitive vision and makes picking out prey by its own relative movement easier. It has been suggested that remaining completely still when confronted by a tetrolimulus may prevent detection, but none have been able to confirm the success of this tactic, and there are none who are confident enough of the theory to test it in the field.",
			"",
			"Female tetrolimuluses, the hunters of the species, are by far the more aggressive. Rarely seen, males live in deeper waters as bottom feeders, emerging only in the mating season in early spring. At this time for a few days each year, both sexes make great journeys, sometimes of hundreds of miles, to return to ancient coastal breeding grounds. Here dominant and aggressive females meet and mate with the strongest of the smaller and more delicate males. Only a small number of these males get a chance to breed, and an even smaller number survive to return to the oceans. The energy and effort of their travels exhaust the females, and once they've been impregnated, the easiest and closest source of food is the weaker males surrounding them. A fertilized female may even continue to exhibit signs of availability to encourage more males to approach her: not for reproduction, but to satisfy her more immediate hunger.",
			"",
			"Young are born at sea, and perhaps as payment for their strength and power later in life, they spend their first few months at the bottom of the food chain. Without the thick shells of maturity, they are easy prey, which contributes a great deal to population control of their species. As their shells thicken and harden, they start to enjoy a less harried existence, and by 6 months old they start to fight back. They reach maturity in 12 to 18 months and can live for up to 50 years.",
			"",
			"Tetrolimuluses' behavior is largely instinct-driven, but during the breeding season the normally nomadic creatures will fight viciously to protect the shores of their ancestral breeding grounds. Even male sea-mantises rise to combat, though at sea they more commonly flee than risk confrontation.",
			"",
			"Females can be found in the area of the Abendego Gulf, from Mediogalti Island all the way into the Shackles and as far north as the Sodden Lands. Even Rahadoum has seen the occasional tetrolimulus washed ashore to the south, where the creatures are feared as the twisted manifestations of Achaekek, conjured for worship by the Red Mantis and a stark reminder of the folly of religious devotion. There are descriptions of creatures similar to the tetrolimulus to the north, even into the Inner Sea, but these stories are as old and leaky as the ships of the pirates and traders who tell them and no reports of tetrolimuluses along the cost of Cheliax, for example, are younger than two generations.",
			"",
			"Much of tetrolimuluses' bulk is armor, and despite their size they can survive on relatively small quantities of food. In perhaps the only mark of intelligence in their species, they try to avoid overfishing, instead roaming over several miles of coastline to balance their ecology. The majority of their diet is fish and cephalopods, but they are competent trackers and follow hints of habitation on their beaches to devour any coast-dwelling mammals foolish enough to find themselves on the beaches, including humanoids. Like most animals, tetrolimuluses tend to avoid large settlements or areas frequently visited by humans. Remote or inaccessible beaches are the females' preferred habitat, but occasionally a powerful storm rolling out of the Eye of Abendego can toss them on more popular or even populous coastlines. Surprisingly high concentrations of the creatures are found around Mediogalti Island and its outlying cluster. Some suggest this is due to deliberate cultivation by the Red Mantis, thanks to the tetrolimulus's favorable form, but it may simply be because the treacherous waters and hidden coves are perfect for their reclusive lifestyle, and the frequent mutinies, shipwrecks, and foolish adventurers provide a varied and ample diet for the brutal predators.",
			"",
			"### Tetrodotoxin",
			"",
			"While none are stupid enough to actively farm sea-mantises, occasionally the corpse of one is washed up into the more accessible bays on the coasts of the Shackles or Mediogalti Island. Some of the more enterprising residents of Ilizmagorti have developed a method of harvesting the cruel tetrodotoxin poison, from which the tetrolimulus gets its name, for sale to the assassins of the Red Mantis.",
			"",
			"A single dose of tetrodotoxin sells for 1,300 gp. Its rarity and potency make it a valuable product, and prices outside the Shackles or Mediogalti Island can be 50-100% higher.",
			"",
			"One dose of poison can be harvested from the corpse of a tetrolimulus, provided the lower half of the creature is intact. This requires a DC 25 Survival check, and even those who usually find themselves competent at skinning or gutting creatures struggle with the intricacies of the sharp tail stinger. In harvesting the tetrodotoxin poison, those without the poison use ability are subject to the standard 5% chance of self-poisoning."

When a marble sentinel detects a trespasser, it can choose to alert the creature to which it's keyed in one of two ways. The sentinel can create a loud sound like that of a bell, chime, or gong that can be clearly heard at a range of 500 feet. Alternatively, a marble sentinel can send a mental alert to the creature to which it is keyed as long as that creature is within 1 mile of the sentinel. The mental alert wakes the keyed creature from sleep, but doesn't affect normal concentration.

Their close connection with the earth likewise gives them immunity to natural toxins.",
			"",

On these occasions, they murder the hapless victim and feast on his remains. Their uncanny ability to hide in the endless waving fields of cane lets them avoid the patrol of the Pure Legion or posse of vengeful farmers that comes around to search for the killer."

The mephits say that the mountain-sized ancestors of modern thoqquas were servants of the elemental lords, and dug the first volcanoes in the young worlds of the Material Plane. These progenitor worms then retired to the worlds' cores, where their heat warms the planets even today.

If a thorgothrel spends an hour experimenting on a target rendered unconscious due to Intelligence damage, it can make this regression permanent. Thereafter, the target's Intelligence score is reduced to 1. This regression can be reversed only with heal, limited wish, miracle, or wish. At the GM's discretion, the target might change in additional ways to reflect its atavistic regression.",

A creature with more than 6 HD takes 1d4 points of Constitution damage each round while in the mist (Fortitude half).

A thorgothrel can move about on Golarion only by wrapping its body around a frame of silver rods that provides inner support and encases the creature in a resilient force field barrier. Despite the hazard Golarion's atmosphere poses to these alien creatures, the planet's staggering diversity of life presents a veritable cornucopia of beings upon which they can perform their genetic experimentations, inching closer to their goal of returning all creatures to a primeval, atavistic state.",

			"Hailing from a distant planet with a radically different environment, thorgothrels don't fit into Golarion's ecosystem. The environment on Golarion is deadly to this spacefaring race, as the planet's comparatively low air pressure causes them to vaporize when exposed to it. Thorgothrels on Golarion combat this by remaining continually sheathed in a protective force field to avoid fatal dematerialization. Even in the best of conditions, a thorgothrel moves slowly. On Golarion, it must wrap its protoplasmic form around an artificial skeleton in order to move at a speed greater than a crawl. Thorgothrel mathematics are based on a ternary system, which is reflected in their armatures usually having three legs and three arms radially placed around a central spine.",
			"",
			"Thorgothrels feed on electrical currents and certain metals. The armatures thorgothrels create in order to provide mobility are made of electromagnetically charged and refined silver, and thus contain all of the nutrients the creatures need to survive for several months. Without an armature, a thorgothrel requires an ounce of silver per week to survive. Thorgothrels don't require true sleep, and the torpor they enter in the long years of travel between planets in their strange ships provides them with sufficient rest to remain active for months at a time.",
			"",

			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"The thorgothrel race were once humanoids. The greatest of their scientists and philosophers concluded that evolutionary advancement was a danger to the universe as a whole, and that life in its most primitive state was safest for all creatures. The thorgothrels began a great spacefaring crusade to subjugate other planets and force regressive evolution on the planets' denizens via genetic manipulation. Thorgothrels take pride in devolving entire planets into primitive life forms, and slaughter those races that put up too much of a struggle against their \"great work.\"",
			"",
			"As the thorgothrels \"improved\" world after world, they also manipulated their own genes. While maintaining their intelligence and skill at genetic manipulation, the race regressed its form to that of sentient blobs of protoplasm. Thorgothrels buttress the weaknesses of these new bodies, such as low mobility, with technological solutions. Although silver armatures and defensive force fields are the most common artifacts of thorgothrel science, rumors from other worlds tell of thorgothrels that occupy gargantuan walking machines or psychic field projectors powerful enough to render entire cities docile.",
			"",
			"Their great crusade has caused the once numerous thorgothrel race to dwindle, but the race's fervor to enforce regression still continues on many far-flung planets. A few decades ago, thorgothrel explorers discovered Golarion and were staggered by the abundance of advanced life found on this world. However, Golarion's unfavorable environment and great distance from the thorgothrels' homeworld has so far stymied a full-scale assault. To date, only a few daring adventurer-geneticists have come to Golarion. To avoid attracting wide public attention, these thorgothrels pursue their regression experiments in isolated locations, such as lonely wastelands, border outposts, or hidden valleys. Thorgothrels carefully dissect failed experiments in order to hone their craft, but usually set successfully regressed victims free. Rumors of remote areas where animals or people have suddenly \"gone wild\" or \"turned feral\" may indicate a thorgothrel's presence.",
			"",
			"Thorgothrels are arrogant and prone to overconfidence. Most thorgothrels encountered on Golarion have visited dozens of other worlds, and they consider even the most advanced of Golarion's creatures to be evolutionary mistakes that must be corrected or exterminated. This gives thorgothrels little reason to communicate with other races, which in turn feeds into their intellectual and philosophical mandate to act however they see fit."

			"**Eat Thoughts (Su)** A living and corporeal creature that takes damage from a thought eater's bite loses some of its thoughts, as the thought eater drains them to nourish itself.

They are so tied to that place that without its energy, a thought eater's psychic power begins to deplete, until finally the very fabric of its own personal reality breaks down and it fades out of existence. But while the Ethereal Plane is necessary for thought eaters' continued existence, its vastness and relative lack of prey force thought eaters to sometimes hunt on the Material Plane. Such trips are often gluttonous affairs, as the thought eaters must not only gain sustenance, but also gain enough nourishment to stave off their rapid psychic and physical decay in that hostile environment.",
			"",
			"Normally, thought eaters are fairly single-minded, but the inherent danger in their forays to the Material Plane makes them eager for easy meals. Someone who takes the time to provide consistent easy meals for a thought eater can expect the creature to follow her on the Ethereal Plane, watching for its next feeding time. Given that every minute on the Material Plane is strenuous for a thought eater, such a person is unlikely to receive much conversation from the creature trailing her, but if something threatens the safety of its food source, the thought eater may be moved to protect its companion. In this case, the thought eater uses its daze monster ability to help the person escape and may even be motivated to cast resist energy on her. If this bizarre and alien friendship continues for long enough, the thought eater may even choose to assist in identifying magic items-when properly compensated, of course."

			"Thremindyrs are often mistaken for ghosts or some manner of frozen spirits when spotted in the wild. Although they are not incorporeal, these icy elemental beings are pale and wispy, and are easily overlooked in the wintery outdoors where there is little to contrast with their translucent white bodies. If viewed against a dark backdrop, a thremindyr looks like a long-limbed humanoid. Close up, their features have an inhuman, angular, and almost crystalline quality to them. They sport high cheekbones, upward-slanted eyes, and pointed ears. What might represent hair is a swirling mass of ever-roiling tendrils of mist and snow. Thremindyrs are usually androgynous, but very rarely some thremindyrs sport what appears to be a beard composed of icicles. When agitated, these arctic elementals radiate a flurry of snow in the direction of their attention, especially when they howl and roar. They possess a considerable strength but are ephemeral, like an air elemental. Thremindyrs stand roughly 7 feet tall and weigh no more than 15 pounds.",
			"",
			"### Ecology",
			"",
			"The name \"thremindyr\" roughly translates from the Giant language as \"breath of Thremyr,\" and a connection between the giant god and these creatures appears certain. Students of ancient lore and experts on the planes point to legends that describe how parts of the god Thremyr fell away from the deity and sprang to life, creating the frost giant, ice troll, and winter wolf races, and suggest that thremindyrs may have been created in the same way. These legends say that, instead of sloughing off of Thremyr as he staggered into the Steaming Sea, the first thremindyr escaped from Thremyr's lungs as the ancient being sighed, passing through his lips and onto Golarion.",
			"",
			"Although this in some ways parallels how thremindyrs reproduce on the Material Plane, the theory that thremindyrs spawn directly from the deity isn't supported by the evidence. For one thing, thremindyrs hail from the Plane of Air, and Thremyr does not reside there. Scholars propose that the thremindyrs' existence actually informs one of the nature of Thremyr-and other gods worshiped by giants (such as Gozreh)-far more than the other way around.",
			"",
			"Thremindyrs are consistently humanoid in shape, unlike many other elemental beings, whose shapes are often chaotic or take on animalistic forms. Thremindyrs spontaneously generate on the Plane of Air, but procreate through asexual reproduction on the Material Plane. They seem to thrive on the Material Plane, and by some accounts are slowly evolving to a less elemental state of existence.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"Thremindyrs are thought to have originally sprung into existence in the misty zone where the Elemental Plane of Air juts up against the Plane of Water. Whatever their origin, thremindyrs have proliferated and are encountered as indigenous forms of life in many places on the Material Plane, especially on Golarion. When encountered outside of the Material Plane, thremindyrs possess the extraplanar subtype. Thremindyrs who dwell on the Material Plane require air, food, and moisture and have daily periods of inactivity. The creatures wither and die quickly in hot environments, and are found only in environments where water can freeze. Though thremindyrs need to eat, the period of time between each feeding can stretch for months.",
			"",
			"Thremindyrs are curious creatures, but they are contemptuous of beings that can't adapt to the environments in which these outsiders thrive. When they coexist with creatures immune to their bitter cold presence, it is with a reserved indifference or muted curiosity. They are fickle and rarely maintain long-term alliances with other creatures.",
			"",
			"Among their own kind, thremindyrs are peaceable and demonstrate a willingness to share ideas and cooperate-though they lack any ideas that do not lend themselves to mischief and mayhem. Thremindyrs are disastrously curious, and tend to treat any new stimulus as an excuse for playful destruction. A gathering of thremindyrs is dangerous indeed; more than one mountaineering expedition has been lost by being frozen to the side of a mountain by these strange elemental beings.",
			"",
			"Thremindyrs chafe at being summoned-they have little patience for communication with creatures that have no natural inclination to cold or abilities to overcome it. Yet if directed toward an objective or opponent that it can freeze solid, a summoned thremindyr quickly forgets the indignity and sets about its work with malicious glee.",
			"",
			"In combat, thremindyrs attempt to keep their distance from their enemies. They prefer to fly just out of the reach of their foes and attack with their breath weapons, hoping to entrap those struck. Once an opponent is immobilized, the thremindyr focuses on other foes until they are all coated in rime. Thremindyrs can tell whether creatures are magically protected against the cold, and they find these sorts of protections affronts to their icy nature. Thremindyrs focus their attacks on protected creatures first, and use their shatter protection ability to break down these defenses. If their enemies fight using ranged weapons, thremindyrs soar down and attack using Flyby Attack, sometimes remaining in melee combat long enough for their auras to damage their opponents."

In times of peace, thriae constructors labor to build, expand, and renovate hives and enhance its fortifications.

			"**Launch Merope (Su)** A thriae queen can launch a stream of merope from a gland in her lower body in a 60-foot line as a standard action. A thriae queen using this ability can control the purity of the merope she launches, which makes it either harm those it touches or heal them. If a thriae queen chooses to make her merope harmful, all creatures in the area of effect take 20d8 points of acid damage (Reflex DC 29 for half). In addition, any creature in the area of effect is also staggered for 1d4 rounds (or 1 round if it succeeds at its Reflex save). If she uses it to heal, the merope heals all living creatures in the area of effect for 10d8 points of damage. A thriae queen can use this ability once every 1d4 rounds. The save DC is Constitution-based.",
			"",
			"**Merope Coat (Su)** A thriae queen is covered in a thin layer of merope. This coating acts as a magical barrier between spells cast at the thriae queen, as though she were constantly under the effects of spell turning. The coat affects a maximum of eight spell levels-when a spell effect is turned, this coating is depleted by a number of spell levels equal to the level of the spell reflected. The queen regenerates this coating at a rate of one spell level per round. A spell in excess of what the merope coat can currently reflect is not reflected, and reduces the merope coat to a score of 0. Spells that fail to penetrate the queen's spell resistance do not reduce the merope coat's efficiency in this manner.",
			"",
			"**Spawn Soldiers (Su)** Three times per day as a standard action, a thriae queen can spawn a large swarm of wasps. This functions as four separate wasp swarms that occupy all of the squares adjacent to the thriae queen. These swarms do not harm any thriae, and while they move with the queen as she moves, the swarms cannot leave her side. The swarms last until they are destroyed or 1 hour passes, at which point the swarms die on their own.",
			"",

			"",
			"#### Description",
			"",
			"The most powerful individual within any given thriae colony, the queen is a divine soothsayer, a provider of life, and a destroyer of those would seek to disrupt the order of the colony. Viewed by her children as a benevolent matriarch rather than a mother, the thriae queen is the only fertile member of the colony, and thus the sole reproducer should the colony's population meet a devastating blow, whether through plague, famine, or war. A queen is revered by soldiers and seers alike, both for her physical might and her divine power, and she exemplifies the very best of thriae society in terms of strength, insight, and magnetism. While a queen is often too busy to entertain guests of a thriae hive, those intruders who do catch a glimpse of her are captured by her beauty and grace, and many would follow her if only to be by her side. But those who are allowed to enjoy the queen's company are few, and those few are carefully selected from among the hive's greatest warriors and priestesses, soldiers and seers whose powers have shown them to be skillful as well as loyal.",
			"",
			"Most thriae colonies only have one queen, though particularly large or far-reaching hives have been known to have as many as three at any given time. Thriae queens are the ultimate authority within a hive, and make most of the major decisions regarding the colony's growth. Only the wealthiest and most respected outsiders are granted an audience with the ever-busy queen, whose numerous duties around the hive are analogous to those of any other ruler of a small kingdom. They grant only audiences regarding matters of the utmost concern, matters that stimulate the curiosity of a thriae queen and require not merely the cryptic readings of seers but a true divination as only a queen can provide.",
			"",
			"When not divining or performing governmental tasks, a thriae queen can often be found in her private chamber, where she lies with male consorts, lays eggs, cares for her larvae, and creates the vast stores of merope used every day within the hive. Consorts are chosen carefully, as they are constantly within extremely close proximity to the queen, who is far from vulnerable in her own right but nonetheless often prefers to avoid conflicts with would-be assassins or burglars.",
			"",
			"A thriae queen lays fertilized eggs in one of the waxy, golden cells of her chamber walls. Thriae eggs go through several stages of growth before becoming fully formed thriae-the longest stage of development is the larval stage, which is a crucial point in determining the formation of a thriae. Most larvae are fed merope while they grow, but in the height of her power, a thriae queen selects a single larva to be her successor, and she feeds that individual a special substance secreted from her merope gland called royal merope. This thick, jellylike substance strengthens the larva and causes it to grow greatly in size, and when it pupates and hatches, it does so as a fully grown thriae queen.",
			"",
			"The mother queen teaches its successor in the ways of divining as well as ruling a colony. The successor then faces a choice-either remaining in the colony she was born into and furthering the growth of the hive, or setting out on her own to establish an allied colony. If she does the latter, the remaining queen must birth another successor, which is not considered so much a bother as it is an unavoidable circumstance. Queens do not look upon successors who leave as deserting daughters, instead viewing them as future allies for the colony down the road.",
			"",
			"### Thriae Larvae",
			"",
			"Larvae who are fed regular merope become soldiers, seers, or other contributing members of thriae society. While more susceptible to harm in the larval stage, thriae larvae still pose a threat to unwary intruders who find themselves among the cells of numerous unhatched thriae. Creatures that succeed at a DC 15 Perception check or Knowledge (nature) check notice larvae embedded in the hive's waxy walls. Unhatched thriae larvae can detect disturbances outside their cell walls, and burst from the cells in order to prey upon the nutritious intruders. Any creature within 5 feet of a larval cell must make a DC 15 Reflex save to avoid becoming infested with the larvae. A creature that becomes infested must make a successful DC 15 Fortitude save each round to avoid taking 1d2 points of Constitution damage and falling asleep-additional Constitution damage from feeding larvae does not wake sleeping victims. Feeding larvae can be detached from the creature they cling to by cutting them off with a slashing weapon (which requires a DC 20 Heal check that deals 1d4 points of damage per larva attached) or by dealing cold damage to the larvae at any time, which also deals half damage to the creature the larvae are covering. Remove disease or a similar effect kills any thriae larvae on the host.",

While not as spiritually powerful as their seer and queen kin, soldiers possess remarkable agility and skill with the bow.

Thriae soldiers are often talented artisans as well as warriors, and most create their own weapons to bear in combat.",

When circumstances are especially grim, commanders of thriae militias will order all of their troops to consume their merope at once, giving the company the final burst of strength it needs to turn the tide of battle.",

A Thrushmoor angler can suppress or resume this ability as a free action. This is a mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.",
			"",
			"#### Description",
			"",
			"The Thrushmoor angler, named for the Ustalavic town of Thrushmoor around which it can be commonly found, is a bizarre and voracious semi-aquatic predator. Preferring to feed on intelligent humanoids, it lurks at the edges of swamps and by marshy riverbanks, using an illusory lure that assumes the form and even the voice of past meals to draw hapless victims into its massive jaws.",
			"",
			"At home in deep water and only partially adapted for land, the angler resembles a great, human-sized deep-ocean fish with mottled, slimy skin. The creature's flesh exudes a thick coating of slime, allowing its awkward, bulky body to slide with relative speed through underbrush and along drier surfaces, propelling itself forward by the combined action of multiple powerful but misshapen limbs.",
			"",
			"A female Thrushmoor angler is typically 5 feet tall and weighs 250 pounds. Males of the species generally grow no larger than 1 foot in length and weigh less than 30 pounds.",
			"",
			"Thrushmoor anglers are not natural creatures, but their true origin remains as murky as the waters they call home. First encountered in the marshes surrounding the Ustalavic city of Thrushmoor in 4683 ar, the creatures have spread further in the decades since. They now primarily dwell within the waters of northern Avalon Bay between Thrushmoor and Illmarsh. The anglers have also moved upstream, colonizing the Danver and Destach rivers, including the latter river's source, Lantern Lake. Despite their expansion, however, the creatures remain most common in and around Thrushmoor itself, and their spread appears oddly self-limited, given that there are ample nearby regions rife for colonization. This suggests that some unknown factor artificially limits the extent of their outward push-a blessing for Ustalav as a whole-or more fiendishly, that something or someone is actively calling out and organizing them, like a shepherd gathering his sheep and not allowing them to run too far afield.",
			"",
			"The Thrushmoor angler is most feared for its method of hunting, in which it actively lures prey, not by simply attracting targets to a glimmering light like some lesser pelagic, piscine predator, but by far more insidious means. Would-be victims report seeing recently lost or missing persons calling out for help, floundering in deep water, or motioning them deeper into swampy overgrowth to retrieve a stuck cow or even to help recover a buried treasure. These visages of the dead are only illusory figments conjured forth by the Thrushmoor angler to draw more victims to where it waits, hidden and with its jaws yawning wide. Once an unfortunate soul steps close enough to the creature, the sight of the iridescent lamp-shaped lure suspended above the angler's misshapen head clouds victim's the mind and draws her to simply walk in a daze toward the angler. The beast prefers to swallow its impassive victims whole, its backward-angled teeth drag them screaming down its gullet.",
			"",
			"Commonly thought of as ignorant beasts capable of communication only via their illusory methods of luring in prey, Thrushmoor anglers actually speak a dialect of Aklo. Scholars increasingly posit that the first of their kind were introduced into Ustalav from elsewhere, perhaps flushed into the waters of Lake Encarthan in the waste bilge of ships dumping ballast near port. Others, however, claim the anglers originate from some other plane or planet, or else were created by creatures from such a place, wherever it might be. Such concerns are largely academic, though, to the fisherfolk, trappers, and travelers who most often run afoul of the creatures' appetite for warm and intelligent flesh.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"The description above applies only to female, as this species displays stark sexual dimorphism. By comparison, a male Thrushmoor angler is roughly the size of an adult carp with skin covered in slime rather than scales. They are exclusively aquatic (until attached to a female) and rise only just above animal intelligence. The males have vestigial limbs unfeasible for traveling on land, plus a tiny glowing lure useful only for attracting smaller prey such as minnows, frogs, and small rodents.",
			"",
			"Female Thrushmoor anglers prefer to hide themselves in dense brush, thick stands of river reeds, or within marshy shallows just out of easy reach of the shore. Fully amphibious and having lungs as well as the ability to breathe through their skin when submerged, they return to water only periodically, either to moisten their porous flesh, to digest larger prey, or to spawn. Given the females' protracted periods away from deeper water and their relative rarity, male anglers use a form of sexual parasitism in which they latch onto and literally fuse with their larger partner's body. What at first appear to be a scattered number of atrophied limbs are in fact up to a dozen males grown onto and feeding off of their mate, moving and wriggling as needed to aid in her ambulation and producing much of the slime coat that makes her movement out of water possible.",
			"",
			"Lone hunters reliant on ambushes and luring humanoid prey, with half of their species driven by little more than base instinct, Thrushmoor anglers would seem to have relatively little society. Yet the female anglers speak fluent Aklo, and they converse and sing when they undergo their rare spawning periods in deep water. During these times, dozens of their kind gather together and fill the swamps with a dread burble and wail, made all the more eerie by the flickering ghost lights of their deadly lures and not-infrequent invocations to the Great Old One, Bokrug the Water Lizard. Mingling with the anglers' calls and religious cries are the jarring sounds of their illusory lures, as the beasts take pride in showing off their most recent meals and reenacting victims' screaming deaths-displays met by their fellows' hideous laughter."

			"Thylacines are large marsupial carnivores. They typically hunt alone, only occasionally forming small packs. Thylacines hunt at night, and rest during the day in nests hidden away from the world in hollowed trees or bushes. Farmers fear the creatures, blaming all manner of problems on them. However, thylacines are quite shy and antisocial, and usually avoid human settlements. Because of their odd, almost hybrid appearance, thylacines have a far harsher reputation than they probably should, playing a sort of bogeyman role in farming communities.",

Surprisingly, they are often kept as pets by Tian-La leaders, as blood cougars are more easily domesticated and tamed, and serve as far better companions and hunting aids. Although they are slightly smaller than normal thylacines, they make up for it in ferocity and cunning. These red beasts have the advanced creature template.",
			"",
			"Casmar Thylacine: In Casmaron, most thylacines are smaller than the typical beast. For this reason, they tend to form larger packs, often twice the size of an average thylacine pack. These smaller beasts stand 6 inches to a foot shorter at the shoulders. Casmar thylacines are normal thylacines with the young creature template added, and gather in packs of 2-10.",
			"",
			"Sarusan Wolf: The Sarusan wolf is a slightly bigger and more doglike form of the normal thylacine. Whereas indigenous people refer to the thylacine as a lion or other great cat, the Sarusan wolf has an unmistakable canine jaw. While they are physically larger, Sarusan wolves are actually less hardy than their traditional cousins, due to poor weight allocation. Prone to tiring quickly and falling down, Sarusan wolves focus more on rapid takedowns of their prey. Sarusan wolves have a Constitution score of 12 and gain [Power Attack](feat/power_attack) as a bonus feat."

			"**Driftwood-Dependent (Su)** A tidewretch is mystically bonded to a single piece of driftwood originating from the tree to which she was bonded in life. The tidewretch can never stray more than 300 yards from this piece of driftwood. A tidewretch who moves more than 300 yards beyond her bonded driftwood immediately becomes staggered and takes a -2 penalty on her attack and damage rolls and ability and skill checks and to the save DCs of her special abilities (including spell-like abilities). Every hour thereafter, she must succeed at a DC 15 Will save or these penalties increase by 2 (increases are cumulative). A tidewretch that is out of range of her bonded driftwood for 24 hours gains 1 negative level, which becomes permanent 24 hours thereafter, at which time she gains another negative level. Eventually, this separation destroys the tidewretch. Unlike a dryad, a tidewretch can't forge a new bond with another piece of driftwood, though many tidewretches find that they can carry their driftwood with them, as it is not rooted to the ground like a living tree.",
			"",
			"**Parasites (Ex)** The first time each round a tidewretch hits a target with a melee attack, a swarm of small parasites issues forth from the rotting wood that makes up her body, covering the target and causing discomfort and distraction. The target becomes staggered, but it can spend a standard action to brush the parasites off its body and end the effect.",
			"",
			"**Vermin Empathy (Ex)** This ability functions as a druid's wild empathy, except a tidewretch can use this ability only on vermin. A tidewretch gains a +4 racial bonus on this check. Vermin empathy treats swarms as one creature having a single mind; a tidewretch can thus use this ability to influence and direct swarms with relative ease.",
			"",
			"#### Description",
			"",
			"Tidewretches are undead dryads whose trees have died and become waterlogged driftwood. The dead state of the tree to which a tidewretch is bound is reflected in her disfigured appearance, especially her wrinkled and cracked wooden skin. Bits and pieces of the tidewretch have completely rotted away, leaving nothing but scar-like holes in her decomposing flesh. A tidewretch's fingers have sharpened into claws, and her eyes have become cold and dark. Tidewretches are home to hosts of parasites, and small insects can be seen skittering in and out of their cracked skin. When alone, tidewretches regularly weep tears of dirty water in lament for their fallen trees.",
			"",
			"Tidewretches are usually around 5 feet tall and weigh about 90 pounds.",
			"",
			"When a dryad's tree dies and falls into a body of water, the dryad inhabiting it sometimes survives to become a twisted, vengeful tidewretch. Such a creature follows the largest section of the remains of her dead tree down the currents of whatever body of water it travels, having little control over where it might end up. Along the way, the undead fey slowly begins to rot, quickly collecting parasites and fungi that survive on the nutrients in the driftwood and in the tidewretch herself.",
			"",
			"Tidewretches are viewed as unnatural by regular dryads and other fey. Animals are easily spooked by their presence, and water-dwelling creatures give them a wide berth. However, a tidewretch's quick movement through lakes and rivers makes her difficult to keep track of and predict. Tidewretches stalk riverbanks and shorelines for unsuspecting creatures to torment and destroy before moving on. They leave their victims in a particularly grotesque state: their victims' bodies are drained of all natural fluids, which are replaced to the point of overflowing with filthy, brackish water.",
			"",
			"Despite their love of killing, tidewretches have no need to eat flesh to survive, and they continue their undead existence as long as their bonded driftwood remains intact. Because their survival depends on the security of their driftwood, many tidewretches hide their bonded driftwood among large piles of detritus or bind their driftwood with chains or sturdy seaweed ropes to the bottom of a body of water, floating like haunted buoys deep beneath the surface. Occasionally, a tidewretch may drag her driftwood inland and carve it into a piece of furniture, an idol, or a totem, or she might even use it as part of the construction of a makeshift structure. In any case, the tidewretch works to ensure her driftwood is either hidden or obscured so that her greatest weakness does not bring about her undoing.",
			"",
			"A tidewretch is considered a menace to nature, and she is a highly sought-after target for druids and protector fey. Tidewretches take trophies from hunters who fail to destroy them, as reminders of both the warmth of life and their undying desire to survive no matter the cost. This leads to them collecting treasures that they store in the crevasses of their driftwood trees. These large stashes of treasure often lead more hunters and adventurers to seek the riches that ancient tidewretches carry.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"Tidewretches' constantly traveling, mobile homes make for many potential habitats. Usually, a tidewretch is either moving with a current or settled on a still body of water. Tidewretches most often originate along the sides of forest rivers, and as such they encounter plenty of living victims as they travel along those rivers to their eventual resting places. While tidewretches who keep moving with the water tend to survive longer than those who remain in one spot-becoming the subjects of legend as their victims pile up-many of them try to stay in the same place for long periods of time if they can guide themselves to still water. Stationary tidewretches prefer to live in environments that resemble those where their trees used to grow. Such tidewretches seek to emulate living dryads, even burying their tree's roots and draping any branch-fragments with greenery.",
			"",
			"Tidewretches are solitary creatures by both nature and circumstance. They arise rarely and can end up in many different locales. They do not get along with creatures other than the vermin that occupy their trees and bodies, and they permit the company of others of their kind only out of a shared sense of survival. Most groupings of tidewretches (called tangles) last only briefly, collapsing when their respective members turn on one another and try to destroy each others' driftwood to ensure dominance, or else parting ways quickly to avoid such a fate.",
			"",
			"There are rare circumstances in which pairs of tidewretches settle in the same still water for extended periods of time. Usually the two choose to join forces to hunt and continue their tortured existences together. Such tidewretch \"sisters\" maintain a tenuous balance of power, and they are most often equals, sharing a single ambition rather than scrabbling to claim authority. In many cases, such pairs were dryads from the same grove who maintain a connection to one another in undeath, even while their instinct is otherwise to isolate themselves from anything they cannot destroy."

Once the victim is out of hearing range, the tikbalang drags it into a high tree, wraps it in vines, and packs its mouth with leaves and moss to stifle its screams. The tikbalang may eat its prisoner, offer to release it if the other intruders leave, or leave its corpse as a grisly warning to other travelers.",

Time dimensionals travel across the Great Beyond to confront and neutralize threats to the timestream. In some cases, this involves the removal of a disruptive individual or item, while in other cases it simply means delaying events long enough for the flow of time to correct itself. In the event of egregious disruptions, several time dimensionals may work together in perfect synchronicity to preserve the timestream.",

Time dimensionals have appeared during seemingly mundane events, such as the report of a dozen time dimensionals appearing to a group of miners in Brevoy in the summer of 4284 ar. More confounding are events that appear to be an obvious call to time dimensionals, such as the appearance of the legendary Scepter of Ages, but that the dimensionals seem to ignore.",

It has even greater control over its own temporal positioning, allowing it to move quickly around a battlefield and obtain comprehensive knowledge of where its enemies will strike. There are reports of exceptionally rare time dimensionals with greater abilities-such as the ability to erase a creature from time entirely-though the Dimension of Time dispatches such dimensionals only to deal with the most calamitous of situations.",

			"As time dimensionals are incredibly rare creatures, much of the information about them is no more than speculation. Many conflate time dimensionals with elementals, but the nature of a time dimensional is very different. Elementals are formed from the raw matter serving as the principal building blocks of the Elemental Planes (although this matter exists throughout the Material Plane and, indeed, across the Great Beyond). A time dimensional, however, is a living portion of the Dimension of Time itself, which implies a measure of inherent sapience in that plane that the Elemental Planes lack.",
			"",
			"A time dimensional has a nearly perfect knowledge of its own past and future, obtained by its constant connection to the Dimension of Time. Whether this connection means that a time dimensional is an extension of that demiplane, like the arm of a creature, or merely in constant mental communion with it, as if part of a hive mind, remains a subject of conjecture.",
			"",
			"Time dimensionals are too powerful for most mortal magic to conjure, and their true names were erased from mortal knowledge in some impossibly ancient time. A [gate](spell/gate) spell could, in theory, beckon one of these creatures to serve, but even then the act of drawing a time dimensional out of the demiplane of Time might be enough to pull more of their kind to investigate- and likely punish-the conjurer. Those who persist in attempting to summon or bind time dimensionals often earn their ire, or else draw the attention of dangerous creatures such as [hounds of Tindalos](monster/hound_of_tindalos).",

			"As time dimensionals exist only at the will of the Dimension of Time, they have no definite society and do not congregate in groups outside of the Dimension of Time unless dispatched on a specific mission. Whether these creatures have formed a society of their own in the Dimension of Time is unknown, as that plane is nearly impossible to access or study.",
			"",
			"Some speculate that there is, in fact, only a single time dimensional, and appearances of multiple ones arise from sightings of the same creature crossing and recrossing its own temporal path, meeting later or earlier incarnations of itself. In this theory, the Dimension of Time created the first and only time dimensional at the birth of time and dispatches the same one to deal with all temporal disruptions, and therefore rumors of time dimensionals with more powerful abilities are sightings of an older or advanced version of the same creature. Too much research into this model appears to be dangerous, however, as chronomancers and temporal scholars who investigate the most advanced time dimensionals often disappear entirely. The esoteric calculations these scholars leave behind hint that, after a certain point, the single time dimensional becomes so powerful that it breaks free of the Dimension of Time and pursues its own independent agenda, with indescribably catastrophic results for the multiverse."

If any such attack roll results in a possible critical hit, the critical is applied to one creature of the hekatonkheires's choosing.

It can only bring itself and its gear when it travels in this manner.

			"Horrifying abominations shunned by the gods immediately upon their creation, the hekatonkheires are perhaps the most powerful and devastating race of titans in existence. When the titans-envious of the gods' divine strength-rebelled against the deities, the hekatonkheires were among the first to pick up arms, weary of the scorn their own creators felt for them. The betrayal of the Elysian titans led to the hekatonkheires' swift capture by the gods, who found the hekatonkheires' power to be so immense that they were not banished to the Abyss with their Thanatotic brethren. Instead, the gods cast the hekatonkheires into the furthest reaches of the multiverse they could find. There, the hekatonkheires drifted in expanses of nothingness for unknown eons, and the madness wrought upon them by isolation destroyed their memories. Yet from their madness these shattered monstrosities spawned progeny to replace them in their pursuit to destroy, and some of these monstrous offspring discovered ways to break through planar boundaries and wander the multiverse freely.",
			"",
			"The gods initially created only three hekatonkheires, seeking to make the ultimate warriors in order to guard the gates to the Abyss. These three ancient titans still drift in the unknown expanses between planes-the hekatonkheires that now walk the worlds are their lesser spawn. But these so-called \"lesser\" titans remain almost unimaginably powerful themselves. They have no knowledge of why their forgotten ancestors were originally banished, and so they wander in search of answers, all the while destroying entire worlds. They are warped engines of mayhem, their existence based wholly on the devastation of life and anything that might remind them of their age-old war against the gods, having inherited only the haunting ghosts of such memories from their ancestors.",
			"",
			"Those hekatonkheires who have emerged back into the multiverse have done so in different realms, and to date, no record of any two of these spawn meeting one another exists. It is fortunate that only one hekatonkheires is encountered on a world at any given time, as even scholars cannot fathom the power that would arise out of two or more of the titans' collective strength. They traverse the planes alone, caring not for allies of any sort until they can remember what their purpose was when they were born eons ago.",
			"",
			"Though hekatonkheires are as intelligent as the rest of their titan relatives, they wander with such destructive and seemingly mindless intentions that they spare no time in communicating with other creatures, especially those that would beg for mercy. The hekatonkheires were created to destroy, and so that is all they desire to do; the crushing blows of their fists and the goring slashes of their weapons speak for themselves. They serve no master, and halt their otherwise endless rampage only if called by their true names, which few-if any-mortals know. Those that do know these names speak them only in whispers, for their mere utterance seems to carry with it immeasurable power.",
			"",
			"A hekatonkheires can only be called via mighty spells such as gate if a conjurer knows the plane the titan is currently on, and only if the conjurer knows the true name of the hekatonkheires it is seeking to call. Only the mad or depraved would dare such a feat, however, as the might of one of these unique goliaths is so massive that the being cannot be controlled, and even if it is banished back to the realm from whence it came, it is never long before the hekatonkheires sets its sights on the world it visited so briefly, if only to sate its lust for destroying it.",
			"",
			"Each hekatonkheires has 50 heads and 100 arms so that one is never caught off guard. The stones that it hurls with its 100 hands are as big as boulders, and those who have seen a hekatonkheires hurl such rocks and lived to tell the tale have said that it is as though an entire mountain is falling from the sky. In addition to their unworldly strength, hekatonkheires are known for their awesome control over the powers of lightning and thunder, and an individual hekatonkheires's arrival is often prefaced by an abrupt and tumultuous storm in the area. Like all titans, hekatonkheires are immortal, and do not die unless they are slain.",

Humanoid in shape, tiyanaks resemble gray-skinned children with shriveled skin, deformed limbs, and patchy hair. A tiyanak's arms end in sharp claws and their mouths are lined with rows of needlelike teeth. A tiyanak typically reaches a height of only 2-1/2 feet, but weighs between 50 and 75 pounds. Tiyanaks use telepathy to communicate their own wretched anger to all those that come close, and infuse their teeth and claws with despair, making them sharper than any blade.",
			"",
			"Tiyanaks hunger for the blood of humanoids, and use their mimicry to emulate the sounds of crying children, attempting to lure unsuspecting people to their side. Once one of these helpful souls draw close, a tiyanak either tries to dispatch its prey with natural attacks, or uses its suggestion ability to convince its target to bring it closer to a humanoid settlement of any kind, where it can torment the family that takes it in and find additional victims. Against multiple enemies, a tiyanak uses its crushing despair and shout spell-like abilities before picking a specific target and attempting to gorge itself on its victim's blood. Despite their single-minded hatefulness, tiyanaks will flee if overpowered, but they typically do not wander far from their point of origin. They have not entirely forgotten the children they once were, and though they loathe their former communities, the sorrowful echoes of their lives make them reticent to move far beyond the places they once thought of as home."

			"The tizheruk is a vicious freshwater predator that wreaks havoc in the lakes and rivers it inhabits. To make matters worse, tizheruks also frequently travel inland via smaller streams where animals and humanoids might think themselves safe. When a tizheruk swims upstream in such waters, it naturally compresses its muscles and organs, enabling it to remain in water less than a foot deep. It explodes to its full size as soon as it attacks, swallowing smaller prey or dragging larger creatures into the water before swimming away with its meal, crushing and potentially drowning its victim.",
			"",
			"Though tizheruks subsist mostly on aquatic prey, they often supplement their diets with creatures caught on the shore, particularly sizable mammals such as deer or wild boars. To capture such creatures, a tizheruk extends its tightly coiled, whiplike tongue to snare one of its prey's legs, then retracts the appendage to pull the creature to its mouth, where it can seize the creature and drag its prey into the water.",
			"",
			"A tizheruk's skin is nearly transparent, granting it natural camouflage beneath the water, where its rustcolored organs and tissue can easily be mistaken for the bed of a creek or stream. After gorging itself on fish or on land animals that wander near the shore, the tizheruk compresses itself on the bottom of a lake or river while it slowly digests its prey. Until then, its stealth is compromised, as the ragged chunks of flesh within its gullet are clearly visible, even if the tizheruk itself remains unseen.",
			"",
			"An adult tizheruk is 15 feet long and weighs 200 pounds, though a tizheruk that has just fed may weigh up to two or three times as much. Larger tizheruks with the giant template are threats to even bigger prey."

Determined to preserve their pride, the grotesque tojanidas ply the waters of the planes seeking hedonistic pleasures-especially culinary ones-and the adoration of other races. Loquacious when addressed with the proper respect, they make excellent heralds and emissaries for more powerful beings, and often enjoy posing as such even when operating on their own.

The fairies then lull their targets to sleep and get to work at claiming their prizes. Some cautious fairies bite their targets to paralyze them and ensure the victims can't wriggle away from the fairy's grasping pliers; others enjoy the sounds of creatures awakening to their own screams as the fairy torments them with harsh pinches and painful tugs on fingers, teeth, or eyelids.",

			"**Death Throes (Su)** When a tooth fairy monarch is slain, it explodes into a cloud of chattering, biting motes that deals 3d6 points of piercing damage to all creatures within a 10-foot-radius burst and imparts the dazzled condition to them for 1d4 rounds. A creature that succeeds at a DC 14 Fortitude save takes half this damage and is dazzled for 1 round. A tooth fairy monarch's scepter is destroyed by this explosion, but its other gear is unaffected. The save DC is Constitution-based.",
			"",
			"**Scepter (Su)** Each tooth fairy monarch owns a heavy scepter of wood, scrap metal, and twine. In the hands of a tooth fairy monarch, the scepter functions as a +1 morningstar. Any loose tooth the tooth fairy monarch touches to the scepter remains firmly adhered to it, requiring a successful DC 25 Strength check to remove, although a tooth fairy monarch can pluck a tooth from its scepter automatically with its tooth eater ability. The scepter has hardness 10 and 15 hit points. If a tooth fairy monarch's scepter is destroyed, all attached teeth fall free and the tooth fairy monarch is staggered until it can create another one, which requires 1 hour of work and a small amount of junk. Although a scepter can hold dozens of teeth, a tooth fairy monarch usually has only 1d6 teeth attached to its scepter when encountered.",
			"",
			"**Tooth Eater (Su)** Using its sinuous tongue, a tooth fairy monarch can grab and consume an unattached tooth within 5 feet as a move action, so long as the tooth is unattended or in its possession (such as attached to its scepter). The tooth fairy monarch regains a number of hit points equal to its Hit Dice (5 hit points for most tooth fairy monarchs), gains nourishment as though it had eaten a full meal, and recovers the use of one of its expended daily spell-like abilities of its choice (if any).",
			"",
			"#### Description",
			"",
			"The rare and reclusive leaders of clans of [tooth fairies](monster/tooth_fairy), tooth fairy monarchs rule their smaller, lesser kin with imperious commands and domineering bluster. These monarchs collect the teeth pulled by the lesser tooth fairies as tribute, affixing the teeth to their magical scepters or forming them into simple jewelry such as crowns, bracelets, or necklaces. A monarch can consume these teeth to gain a burst of supernatural nourishment. They find teeth of large, powerful creatures to be tastier than those of children or smaller creatures (such as other tooth fairies), but they will command their tooth fairy minions to offer up their own teeth for consumption as punishment for failure, or simply to remind onlookers of their authority.",
			"",
			"In combat, a tooth fairy monarch prefers to hold back behind a screen of tooth fairies, exhorting their minions to attack. Monarchs use their spell-like abilities to distract and debilitate foes while directing their minions to pull their enemies' teeth. Tooth fairies bring these teeth to the monarch, even in the middle of a fight, so the monarch can consume them on the spot or stick them to their scepters for later consumption. Fundamentally cowardly, a tooth fairy monarch encountered on its own usually attempts to flee using lies or magical trickery.",
			"",
			"A tooth fairy monarch stands 3 feet high and weighs about 30 pounds.",
			"",
			"Tooth fairy monarchs claim to know secret rituals to elevate common tooth fairies to their own royal stature. They dangle this possibility in front of their dim-witted subjects to compel adoration and loyalty, but the truth is much simpler than the monarchs would like their minions to realize: a tooth fairy that consumes an excessive amount of humanoid teeth-several dozen in a single sitting-might enter a magically induced lethargy and fall asleep. While the tooth fairy is sleeping, a cocoon develops around it and, in about a month, the creature emerges as a tooth fairy monarch. To prevent common tooth fairies from learning the true nature of this transformation, monarchs insist that tooth fairies bring them the teeth they collect, which the monarch hoards. If the monarch hears of a strange cocoon forming within a tooth fairy's lair, he insists on having the cocoon incinerated. Not only does this extreme measure prevent a new tooth fairy monarch from emerging; it also serves to silence any suspicions about where the cocoon came from.",
			"",
			"Tooth fairy monarchs appear to be large tooth fairies from the waist up, but their lower halves resemble a fleshy beetle or cockroach. The membranous wings protruding from their backs appear comically small, but they are powerful enough to sustain the creature in flight. Tooth fairy monarchs produce paralytic saliva but rarely bite their enemies, as they prefer to remain at a safe distance from foes.",
			"",
			"Tooth fairy monarchs might survive for many decades, but the rough and violent life of squabbling tooth fairy clans means few survive more than 20 or 30 years. A tooth fairy monarch that isn't violently overthrown by its own minions, assassinated by a rival monarch, or slain by humanoids grows increasingly fat. While its torso expands, its limbs shrivel, leaving only a ball-shaped head over a quivering mass of flesh. Eventually unable to feed itself, much less defend itself, an old tooth fairy monarch is easy prey for rivals.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"A tooth fairy monarch is rarely encountered without an entourage of several tooth fairies. These attendants serve the monarch diligently, although their attitudes range from genuine respect and adoration to ill-concealed disdain. Outright rebellion against a monarch is rare, however, as tooth fairy monarchs are powerful enough to bully lesser tooth fairies into compliance and frequently punish disloyal minions by removing and consuming all of their teeth in front of them.",
			"",
			"Tooth fairy monarchs live in unused basements, abandoned farms, or other isolated locales that are near humanoid settlements but out of the way of casual observation. Here, tooth fairy monarchs set up their courts, building makeshift throne rooms from scraps discarded by humanoid society. Tooth fairy monarchs often have several minor magic items in their lairs, as many can activate or even create magic items with a casual skill that is the envy of humanoid spellcasters.",
			"",
			"Tooth fairy monarchs are willing to stand up to nearly any creature with imperious bluster. The sole exceptions to their bravado are cats. Even a tiny kitten causes quivering terror in tooth fairy monarchs, and they insist that their attendants chase away such creatures. Most tooth fairy monarchs will abandon all their \"wealth\"- including their hoards of carefully collected teeth-rather than share a lair with a cat."

Upon consuming a victim, the animate statue becomes a walking prison, holding its victim within with little chance for escape. The iron statue can then return its victim to the proper cell, the feet of its lord, or any other fate its creator determines. In the most feared case, tophets capture or are fed prisoners, then wander out into the desert heat or even rivers of molten rock, where their interiors attain hellish temperatures, torturing and often outright killing those trapped within.",

Trailgaunts seek travelers to avenge themselves upon and are driven to feast upon the feet of those they slaughter, often leaving the maimed bodies to rise as new trailgaunts with the setting of the next sun. Trailgaunts with intact feet are rare, yet even those fortunate enough to retain all their toes are slow and clumsy.",

Many variations on this tale exist, but they inevitably revolve around themes of treachery and relentless pursuit."

Yet against those who would threaten the forest, especially loggers who seek to harvest wood for lumber or those who try to clearcut a section of forest in order to build a fort or establish a town, the treants' wrath is swift and devastating. They are particularly gifted at tearing down what others build-a trait that serves angry treants well.",

On battlefields where trench mists are known to have arisen, wise commanders arrange cease-fires during which both sides abandon the site, lest their troops succumb to the horrifying fate of their comrades.",
			"",
			"Part of the trench mist's self-awareness comes from the symbiotic trench zombies it gains as it slaughters its victims, as the zombies under the mist's control retain the abilities they had in life as well as some snippets of their former memories, which all feed into the collective consciousness of the trench mist. This allows the mist to learn and adapt, granting it a relatively keen intelligence compared to other similar creatures, and allowing it to make canny combat decisions and cleverly manipulate its surroundings.",
			"",
			"Trench mists wander battlefields looking for prey so they can add more shambling zombies to their collective hordes. Occasionally they might even enter inhabited areas to seek out fresh ammunition and armaments for those of their symbiotic undead who may have exhausted their weaponry. When bereft of such foul company, trench mists often persist for years after the tides of war have receded, settling into the soil and slumbering until fresh prey arises. The lifespan of trench mists is unknown, though through this sort of hibernation they very well may be immortal, reemerging without warning at the scenes of ancient battles centuries after they have taken place, whether turned up by an unsuspecting farmer's plow or war waged anew.",
			"",
			"### Trench Zombie",
			"",
			"A trench zombie is a rotting creature leaking sulfurous fumes from beneath its acid-burned, peeling skin, and bristling with the armaments it possessed in its horrifying death. Retaining many of the memories and skills it possessed in life, a trench zombie contributes its intelligence into a sort of hive mind for the trench mist that originally spawned it, creating a true symbiosis between the two-a gift the trench zombie repays upon its destruction, when the horrific fumes that granted it unlife go back to the trench mist that birthed it. Trench zombies are foul and vengeful, and are canny enough to lurk within the nurturing embrace of their mother mist, which provides them concealment without impairing their senses. Those seeking trench zombies' destruction typically must enter the engulfing body of a trench mist if they are to ward off the zombies' ranged attacks. Trench zombies are created using the juju zombie template, but they lose the juju zombie's immunity to magic missile, which is replaced by immunity to acid. Trench zombies also gain the following special ability.",
			"",
			"Symbiote (Ex) A unique relationship with trench mists grants trench zombies immunity to acid. In addition, when a trench zombie reaches 0 hit points and is destroyed, the mustard-colored mist that animates the creature bursts violently from its damaged form. All creatures adjacent to the trench zombie are exposed to the toxic gas and take 4d6 points of acid damage. If the trench zombie is enveloped within the fog of its parent trench mist when this death burst occurs, the mist's fast healing ability increases by 1 for a number of rounds equal to the Hit Dice of the destroyed trench zombie. The effects of the deaths of multiple symbiotic trench zombies stack."

			"**Seasoned (Ex)** Triaxians suffer no harm from being in hot or cold environments depending on whether they are Summerborn or Winterborn. Summerborn Triaxians can exist comfortably in conditions between 90 and 140 degrees Fahrenheit without having to attempt Fortitude saves. Winterborn Triaxians can exist comfortably in conditions between 40 and -20 degrees Fahrenheit without having to attempt Fortitude saves. When in conditions of severe cold or heat, Triaxians only have to attempt Fortitude saves once per hour instead of once every 10 minutes. Transitional Triaxians do not have this ability.",
			"",
			"#### Description",
			"",
			"Triaxians are the dominant race on the planet Triaxus, a world whose erratic orbit causes exceptionally long and disparate seasons. Though eerily similar to humans, elves, and the other mammalian humanoids common on Golarion, Triaxians have developed certain adaptations to their environment that mark them as indisputably alien.",
			"",
			"Just like human ethnicities, Triaxian populations vary in size, weight, and other distinguishing physical characteristics, based primarily on the geographical regions in which they reside. Most Triaxians, both males and females, are around 6 feet tall but somewhat lean compared to humans, rarely weighing more than 200 pounds. Their ears are elongated, but rather than being pointed like elves or halflings, these appendages are instead notched in a feathered or comblike pattern. The flaps created by these notches constantly move to adjust the ear's shape, operating both consciously and unconsciously to help Triaxians focus on specific sounds, not unlike the maneuverable ears of dogs, cats, and other such animals.",
			"",
			"Like many creatures on their world, Triaxians have evolved to shift along with their environment, resulting in differences between generations of the same family that would seem bizarre to humanoids from Golarion. In the warm summer years, Triaxians are completely hairless, with skin that ranges from deep red to coffee-colored to charcoal black. This configuration allows them to better survive in the sweltering heat of the planet's tropical summers, with the increased melanin in their dark skin protecting them from the sun's intense rays. These Summerborn Triaxians, as they are known, breed true for many generations-yet as the planet begins its rapid seasonal shift, so do the Triaxians. Newborn Triaxians begin to evince new adaptations to the cooling environment, and by the time winter has come on in full, Triaxians change markedly: their pale bodies are covered in fine, insulating white fur like that of an ermine, while their eyes narrow to elongated slits to protect against snowblindness. These new traits similarly breed true until the seasons begin to change once more, at which point the eyes widen and fur recedes, starting the cycle anew.",
			"",
			"Just as Triaxians differ physically depending on which season they're born into, so do their cultures and customs change. Winterborn Triaxians are defined by the hardship of a world whose very environment seeks to starve or freeze them. They tend to be stolid, hardworking people, with an ironclad sense of honor stemming from the knowledge that in a Triaxian winter, a broken promise can mean death for a whole clan. Even within large communities, the focus remains on survival for one's family and friends, with individuals willing and ready to share, serve, and die to protect the group. Oaths of friendship are serious affairs; once given they are rarely transgressed, and doing so risks a blood feud. With the exception of those nomadic hunter tribes that migrate in pursuit of herd animals, most settlements are permanent and fortified against the predatory horrors that stalk the blinding blizzards.",
			"",
			"Summerborn Triaxians, by contrast, are born into a world of plenty. With forests full of fruit and game, and glaciers receding to reveal vast tracts of fertile earth, the attachment to cold stone fortresses and cramped cities weakens, and Triaxians spread out across the landscape. For many, it is a time of nomadism, living in small bands and temporary structures, or else participating in great waves of land-grabs as homesteaders. Though they still have the weight of history to remind them of the hardships of their ancestors-and those yet to come for their descendants-Summerborn Triaxians tend to be an easy-going, generous people, quick to accept outsiders, to break with their clans and families and strike out on their own, and to challenge convention in pursuit of greater goals. They are simultaneously less hardened and more likely to go to war, for with the business of survival taking less energy and new territory constantly being settled, leaders have more time and resources to dispute borders and jockey for power. Historically, Summerborn Triaxians are those most likely to visit other planes or worlds, as the drive to explore their newly thawed planet also leads them to look beyond it.",
			"",
			"Transitional Triaxians occupy a much smaller portion of the Triaxian adaptation cycle than either the Summerborn or Winterborn-usually no more than a generation each orbital year-and often play an uncomfortable role in their society. To Summerborn Triaxians, a Transitional child is an ill omen-a sign that winter approaches, and that the time of plenty is drawing to a close. The first such individuals to appear are often hidden or slain by their parents, and vilified by those rebellious fools and leaders who believe that Transitional children actively bring on the winter, or who simply don't want to begin the long and arduous process of preparing for future generations' survival. Transitional children born at the tail of winter, on the other hand, are often treasured and held up as hopeful signs of a golden era to come. Yet even these may face persecution by those dynasties that fear change, or whose leaders expect a loss of power once their people are free to spread beyond their reach. In both cases, Transitional Triaxians find themselves in a society where they are visibly different from both their parents and their children, and where their very existence is a weighty portent.",
			"",
			"Strangely, while Triaxians' mutable nature is perfectly adapted to their planet's erratic orbit, the cycle of physiological changes seems keyed to internal clocks rather than external indicators. Even in situations where these adaptations would be disadvantageous, the small populations of Triaxians who have set up residence on other worlds or planes continue to change in time with their kindred on Triaxus.",
			"",
			"Beyond their obvious adaptations to their environment, Triaxians are remarkably human. Their basic biology, social structures, cultures, and philosophy-while sometimes surprising to outsiders-all fall well within the bounds of what might be encountered in a humanoid race on Golarion, thus making them one of the least \"alien\" civilizations in Golarion's solar system. Though the statistics above represent a typical initiate training to become a Dragonrider of the Skyfire Mandate, this is by no means the standard for the race-outside of broad strokes, it's as impossible to describe Triaxians' myriad traits and predispositions as it would be to do so for humanity itself. Triaxians are good and evil, warlike and peaceful, magical and mundane, and everything in between."

The worshipers need not include the creator or possess any special divine powers.",
			"",
			"**Effigy (Su)** As a full-round action once per day, a tribal totem can mimic the shape of any Small or Medium humanoid within its line of sight, reforming itself into a wooden depiction of that creature. Upon doing so, the target can be affected by the effigy ability. While in this shape, the tribal totem knows the location of its target as if persistently using the spell locate creature.

			"",
			"**Spirit Link (Su)** As a standard action, a tribal totem may attempt to join its animating energies with a creature within its line of sight that also shares its likeness (as per the effigy ability). The target can resist this effect with a DC 16 Will save. If this save fails, the target is affected as if it had cast the spell [shield other](spell/shield_other), taking half the damage inflicted upon the tribal totem. In addition, any spell with a range of \"creature touched\" cast upon the tribal totem affects the linked creature rather than the construct. If the spell allows a saving throw, the linked creature can make a saving throw as normal to resist the effect. Spirit link lasts for 4 hours and ends immediately if the tribal totem no longer possesses the target's shape. The save DC is Charisma-based.",
			"",

			"Tribal totems represent a significant cultural achievement for their adopted tribe. Imbued with a spark of life from the continued worship of those they protect, they stand as lifelong guardians of their villages, defending them against enemies and predators alike. To aid them in this function, they also possess the unusual ability to reshape themselves into the likeness of other creatures, targeting them with eerie pains and ailments. This ability enables their tribe to more actively hunt down such enemies while their quarry is hindered and tracked by the totem.",
			"",
			"As mindless automatons, tribal totems remain ever dependent on their creators to direct them. Some serve only a defensive role, strategically placed within villages to aid against attacks.

Originally hailing from the Plane of Water, long ago the triton race migrated to the oceans of the Material Plane, and they are now fully adapted to life there. Their split legs allow them to hobble about slowly on land, but they rarely do so, preferring their natural environment and the greater mobility their forms afford there.",
			"",
			"Tritons make their homes on the sea floor, growing coral reefs and sculpting stones into gentle arcs to create living spaces that are beautiful and natural-looking. Many of these sites lie near great thermal vents, providing not only heat but also rich minerals and nutrients for the fish and other creatures tritons eat. Tritons can breathe air or water, but prefer water. While their cities are designed for water-breathers, they usually feature one or two airtight buildings set aside to hold air for landwalking visitors. Triton settlements can be found anywhere from arctic to tropical waters, but most are in temperate locations. They generally avoid the deepest reaches of the ocean, for it is here that creatures like aboleths and krakens rule-creatures that the tritons have long waged war against.",
			"",
			"Tritons maintain relationships with other good undersea creatures, but mostly keep to themselves. They aid others in fights against their enemies (primarily krakens and aboleths, but also lesser evils like sahuagin or skum). They typically form strong squadrons of aquatic cavalry trained in coordinated attacks when they go to war. Tritons tend to distrust outsiders, and usually avoid land-dwellers. They sometimes provide aid to air-breathers, even though they often see them as trespassers under the sea; when they do help landwalkers, their price for this is high. Nevertheless, when they witness a landwalker do battle against and vanquish a great evil such as an aboleth, they are quick to cast aside their prejudices and accept the great hero into their societies with open and welcoming arms.",
			"",
			"Tritons have silvery skin, hued in tones of aqua blue and kelp green. Older tritons often have barnacles, corals, and seashells crusting the back, chest, and shoulders, worn almost like jewelry as a mark of status among their kind. They have white, blue, or green hair. Tritons' eyes shine blue like sunlight upon a clear sea. A typical triton stands 6 feet in height and weighs 180 pounds. While most exceptional tritons advance by taking class levels (typically as druids, oracles, or rangers), a rare few tritons advance by increasing in size. These Large tritons are great heroes among their kind and have 8 racial Hit Dice or more."

			"The troglodyte is a feral, savage cave dweller. They are among the most populous denizens of the upper reaches of the endless caverns of the underworld, equally at home raiding the settlements of those who dwell above or below ground, yet for all their race's fecundity and sprawl, as a whole they represent only a minor threat. At times, great leaders can draw legions of troglodytes to their command to create vast and deadly armies, but left to their own devices, troglodyte tribes are content to keep each other under control with numerous feuds, cannibalistic raids, and bitter civil wars.",
			"",
			"The troglodyte is one of the oldest of intelligent races, and ruins found in some remote caverns testify to the fact that their empire was once among the largest in the world. At the dawn of time, the troglodyte civilization was generations ahead of other humanoid races-while those races hid in caves and worshiped fire, the troglodytes raised vast cities of stone ziggurats and twisting canals, kept other races as slaves, and worshiped ancient and inhuman gods and demons. Yet as the other races evolved and grew increasingly civilized, they outstripped their one-time troglodyte oppressors. Today, the roles have changed-now it is the troglodyte that hides in caves and lives the life of a feral savage.",
			"",
			"Religion is strong among troglodyte tribes, and their shamans and priests are universally the highest regarded members of a clan. A troglodyte chieftain is not always a cleric or druid, but those who do not have divine power are usually mere mouthpieces and puppet lords that answer to the beck and call of the local seer or shaman. Troglodytes generally worship one of the countless demon lords, particularly those of a reptilian or primeval shape and form or those whose Abyssal domains most closely resemble the tangled caverns troglodytes prefer. Troglodyte druids are usually neutral evil if they dwell with their own kind (and are universally feared and respected for the eerie command they have over beasts).",
			"",
			"A typical troglodyte stands about 5 feet tall and weighs 150 pounds.",
			"",
			"### Troglodyte Variants",
			"",
			"**Source** [Monster Codex pg. 212](source/monster_codex)",
			"",
			"Although most troglodytes are represented by the cave-dwelling creatures documented above, after untold millennia, several troglodyte variants have evolved from the ancient xulgath bloodline and adapted to life in different environments and climates.",
			"",
			"Enlightened Troglodytes (CR 2): These troglodytes dwell far deeper underground than most of their kind. Less bestial than other troglodytes but just as vile, they use their intelligence to enslave more primitive races. They become experts at taming beasts to serve as mounts and sentries.",
			"",
			"An enlightened troglodyte's ability scores are Str 14, Dex 17, Con 16, Int 12, Wis 13, and Cha 13. A typical enlightened troglodyte's skills (not counting ranks gained through class levels) are Handle Animal +6, Stealth +5 (+9 in rocky areas), and Perception +3.",
			"",
			"Kaergath (CR 1/2): Squat, warty, and diminutive, these troglodytes average just under 4 feet tall and weigh 180 pounds. Kaergaths have dull reddish-brown scales and huge, square teeth, but lack the claws of the other troglodytes. Native to the upper reaches of the subterranean wilderness underneath trackless deserts and sun-scorched badlands, kaergaths are known for their ability to burrow through sand, their expertise with the javelin, and their preference for the flesh of humanoid children.",
			"",
			"Kaergaths are troglodytes with the young simple template and the ability to burrow through sand and loose earth (but not stone) at a rate of 20 feet per round. They gain a +1 racial bonus on attack rolls with javelins. Kaergaths have a bite attack that deals 1d8 points of damage, but do not have claw attacks.",
			"",
			"Troglodyte Paragons (CR 5): Although most of the ancient xulgath race perished with the collapse of its great empire long ago, a few powerful individuals survived. These ancient troglodytes went into hiding in the deep places of the world, and though many of them perished, fled to other planes, or retreated into lichdom, a few sought refuge in magical stasis. Over the long centuries, troglodyte paragons have from time to time awakened from their magical slumber. Though some have sought out modern troglodytes in an effort to elevate them and reclaim the glory of their lost civilization, most troglodyte paragons despise their degenerate descendants. Distinguished from common troglodytes by their glowing, emerald eyes and goldtinged scales, troglodyte paragons are long-lived, with maximum lifespans averaging 400 years. Troglodyte paragons are extremely paranoid and obsessed with self-preservation. Most troglodyte paragons have class levels in cleric or sorcerer.",
			"",
			"Troglodyte paragons are Large troglodytes with 7 Hit Dice. Their natural armor bonus increases by 2, their claw attacks deal 1d8 points of damage, and their bite attacks deal 1d6 points of damage. Troglodyte paragons have the following ability scores instead of the standard troglodyte ability scores: Str 22, Dex 9, Con 16, Int 13, Wis 10, and Cha 15. They can use the following spell-like abilities: constant-arcane sight; at will-hypnotism, speak with animals (dinosaurs and reptiles only); 3/day-cause fear, charm monster. Troglodyte paragons with at least 14 Hit Dice (including both racial HD and those from class levels) can also use dominate monster once per day. A typical troglodyte paragon's skills (not counting ranks gained through class levels) are Intimidate +9, Perception +7, Stealth +10 (+14 in rocky areas).",
			"",
			"### Xulgaths",
			"",
			"**Source** [Darklands Revisited pg. 49](source/darklands_revisited)",
			"",
			"Xulgath is the proper term for the troglodyte race; their modern name is a derisive term coined by other species. The xulgath inhabitants of the lowest Darklands continue the legacy of their species, and are far more powerful and proud than their lesser kin. Xulgaths are gifted with potent psychic gifts, which work in tandem with the psychogenic secretions they emit. Unlike their degenerate troglodyte descendants, true xulgaths can master a variety of classes, with an emphasis on martial classes and a small number of psychics.",
			"",
			"Xulgaths show no mercy toward troglodytes who invade their domain. Slaying their devolved kin on sight, xulgaths view them as weak castoffs, bereft of the blessing of their dark gods. Despite this, dozens of the strongest troglodyte tribes reside in close proximity to their former kin, hoping against hope for some form of recognition or acceptance by their ancestors. Although scorned, these troglodyte tribes effectively safeguard the borders of xulgaths' territory from outsiders. Such tribes also provide a veil of false savagery and ignorance over xulgaths' temple cities, where they strive to restore their dominance via obedience to their alien deities.",
			"",
			"Latent Troglodytes (Troglodyte Variant, CR +1): By some genetic miracle of evolutionary remembrance, some troglodytes regain the psychic abilities of their xulgath forbearers. These troglodytes gain a xulgath's psychogenic secretions supernatural ability. These touched troglodytes also gain the following: Psychic Magic (CL 3rd; concentration +3), 4 PE-mind thrust I (1 PE, DC 11), mindlink (1 PE, DC 11), suggestion (2 PE, DC 12)."

Warren guards care for all of the tribe's eggs except those that are badly flawed; the warren guards consume eggs that will not hatch or that will likely result in a weak or sickly hatchling to ensure the future strength of the tribe. Despite warren guards' usual impartiality, religious leaders in the tribe are sometimes able to arrange for preferential treatment for eggs they laid or fertilized. This stops, however, at getting a warmer position for their eggs. A leader who tries to destroy a rival's eggs by pressuring or bribing a warren guard almost invariably draws that guard's wrath. These hulking, savage troglodytes fight with only tooth and claw. They're devoted to guarding the egg clutches, and leave their warrens only if all of the eggs have been destroyed. When set loose from this obligation, warren guards are feral, uncontrolled, and extremely dangerous."

Those who commonly battle with trolls know to locate and burn any pieces after a fight, for even the smallest scrap of flesh can regrow a full-size troll given enough time. Fortunately, only the largest part of a troll regrows in this way.",
			"",
			"Despite their cruelty in combat, trolls are surprisingly tender and kind to their own young. Female trolls work as a group, spending a great deal of time teaching young trolls to hunt and fend for themselves before sending them off to find their own territories. A male troll tends to live a solitary existence, partnering with a female for only a brief time to mate. All trolls spend most of their time hunting for food, as they must consume vast amounts each day or face starvation. Due to this need, most trolls stake out large territories as their own, and fights between rivals are quite common. While these are usually nonlethal, trolls are aware of each others' weaknesses and will use such knowledge to kill their own kind if food is scarce.",

			"#### Description",
			"",
			"One of the most ravenous dangers of the Fangwood are the arboreal canopy trolls, who bound through the treetops in great troops, scavenging fruit and nuts and descending on much larger prey to tear it limb from limb. They share the legendary durability of larger trolls, and plummet fearlessly from great heights to take prey by surprise, often breaking bones only to heal by the time they begin to feed. These injuries rarely set properly, leaving most canopy trolls in constant pain, worsening their already vicious attitudes. Often underestimated, canopy trolls rely on great numbers and their ability to coordinate en masse, overwhelming prey by sheer numbers as they drag it kicking and screaming into their chaotic, howling maws.",
			"",
			"Canopy trolls stand 3-1/2 feet tall, and have prehensile tails nearly twice that length. Their densely muscled bodies weigh as much as 150 pounds.",
			"",
			"Small and quick, canopy trolls possess a number of strange adaptations to help them survive. Like most trolls, their massive jaws can easily rend flesh, and their prehensile feet and oversized hands-nearly as large as a full-sized troll's-help them grapple much larger prey or swing between distant branches with ease. Rather than the vestigial tails most trolls sport, theirs are long and flexible, allowing a canopy troll to hang from a branch, and the tail sports a sharp claw on the end capable of delivering the troll's unusual venom.",
			"",
			"Popular lore in the Fangwood claims that canopy trolls grow from the limbs and other bits of flesh cut from full-sized trolls by clumsy adventurers, but in truth, these agile offshoots are simply another example of the vast variety found among troll species. Though small in stature, these child-sized cousins of the forest's more common trolls retain the ferocity, hunger, and regeneration endemic to their kind. They are omnivores and survive on fruit, leaves, and insects during lean times; like all trolls, though, they vastly prefer fresh meat to help fuel their legendary regeneration. Left unchecked, a troop can strip a forest valley of animal life within a few months-or depopulate a small town-before moving on.",
			"",
			"Female canopy trolls give birth to twins after a 3-month pregnancy and select the stronger of the pair within the first few days, eating the second to ensure they provide ample nutrition for the remaining, nursing child. Young cling to their mother's back for the first 6 months of life, after which they are fast and coordinated enough to keep up with the rest of the troop as they swing through the trees. Canopy troll cannibalism isn't limited to newborns; the creatures' preferred method of dealing with old or sickly members of the troop is to fall upon them and feast on the regenerating morsels.",
			"",
			"**Family:** [Troll](family/troll)",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"Canopy trolls are strictly arboreal, living in the thick branches high above the forest floor. Like the similar moss troll, they rarely set foot on solid ground; many canopy trolls exhibit a mild phobia of the surface, retreating to the trees if knocked groundward in a fight. Their similarities to moss trolls end at their shared terrain, however, as the smaller brutes lack the cunning and innate magic of their larger kin. Though somewhat common west of Lake Encarthan, canopy trolls are rare beyond the Fangwood Forest and smaller woods in the immediate vicinity. They are sensitive to both heat and cold, and quickly fall ill in drier climes. Some rangers insist the creatures hail from the First World, but nearly all strange happenings in the Fangwood are attributed to the mysterious fey realm, and canopy trolls are simply highly specialized for their very specific environment. Rumors place a similar breed of small, arboreal trolls-chimney trolls-in Ustalav, and a more robust cousin of the canopy trolls, called vavanis, terrorizes the jungles of Vudra.",
			"",
			"Despite their barest semblance of intellect, canopy trolls show unusual curiosity, and love to pull things apart-animals and humanoids included-to see what may be inside. They find mechanisms and musical instruments especially fascinating, and an entire troop may take to fighting with each other over a newly discovered harp or horn. They also like to adorn themselves with finery, though any treasures they gather rarely last long as the creatures swing through the branches and pile into their filthy nests. Generally, only magical treasures and small pieces of jewelry retain any value after more than a day in the hands of a canopy troll. This same curiosity makes the creatures especially vulnerable to so-called monkey traps, as once they take hold of a valuable, they rarely willingly let go; clever hunters can snare the monsters simply by dropping shiny coins into a hole just large enough to slide a troll hand into-and too small to pull a coin-filled fist back through. They speak a pidgin of Giant, composed largely of insults and vulgarities, as well as a number of words for food.",

			"Canopy trolls are simpleminded even compared to average trolls, living more like animals than humanoids in apelike troops. A troop selects the largest tree in its territory as a nest site, building rough nests of leaves and grasses and dangling ugly dolls tied from animal bones into the branches. Canopy trolls have little concern for one another, flocking together simply because their preferred hunting tactic - piling onto a single creature until the poor beast can barely move or breathe under the weight - requires large numbers. They hash out a rough pecking order through constant bullying, and after large meals the troop generally falls to infighting to more formally determine the leader for the next few days. Affection and compassion are alien concepts, with each member of the group constantly sniffing out weaknesses to exploit in its neighbors. Troops sometimes gather around an outsider-usually a larger troll but occasionally another large predator-deferring to that individual as temporary leader until they grow restless, hungry, or bored, whereupon they turn their provisional leader into a meal.",

			"#### Description",
			"",
			"Flood trolls are the mutated runts of scrag broods, cast out by their mothers and destined to haunt the lonely valleys and river basins beneath Avistan's frosty peaks. They lurk amid the craggy hills of Belkzen, Varisia, and other wildlands of northern Avistan, and serve as a menace to orc raiders and human adventurers alike. While smaller and less organized than true scrags, flood trolls' solitary nature and desperation for food often drives them to commit atrocities upon unsuspecting humanoid populations-atrocities that almost invariably end with the flood trolls' eventual capture and execution.",
			"",
			"Flood trolls average 7-1/2 feet tall and weigh 250 pounds.",
			"",
			"Flood trolls are not actual trolls in the truest sense of the word. Although flood trolls-like their scrag parents' are distantly related to mountain trolls, the species are distinct. Most humanoid societies, however, are content to simply refer to both scrags and trolls using the umbrella term \"troll,\" linking the species because of overlapping myths and their similar regenerative abilities.",
			"",
			"Scrag mothers birth anywhere from two to six younglings in a single brood, and every brood has a small chance of including what the scrags call an aruktaii - half-scrag in the Giant tongue - known to many civilized peoples as a flood troll. Scrags with larger broods have a higher chance of producing flood trolls among their young. These runts are invariably smaller and more frail than true scrag younglings, and their growth rate is significantly slower than their non-mutated kin. This makes them undesirable to their scrag mothers and more likely to be eaten by their stronger siblings. Those flood trolls who aren't simply abandoned to the wilds by their mothers are raised as lesser beings, and live in the shadows of their scrag brothers and sisters. Most flood trolls flee their aggressive broodmates before coming of age, preferring to fend for themselves in the terrors of the wilderness rather than deal with their cruel, savage family members.",
			"",
			"The mutation that results in a flood troll stymies many of the racial abilities typical to scrags. For one, flood trolls lack the amphibious special quality, making them much less suited to hunting underwater. Unfortunately for them, flood trolls still rely on exposure to water to enable their regenerative properties, meaning they must dwell near water but never wholly within it. Not just any water will do, either-only water that is continually refreshed with minerals and oxygen can regenerate flood trolls. Stagnant or relatively still waters such as small lakes and ponds cannot provide the nutrients flood troll regeneration requires, which means these monsters tend to stay near active waterways and areas with high precipitation where they can find the flowing water and rainfall that helps them to survive.",
			"",
			"The mutation that results in a flood troll also affects the creature's reproductive organs, rendering it sterile. Because they cannot reproduce, flood trolls rarely seek out mates or even partners to aid in the hunt. Instead, they lead solitary existences steeped in ire for all living things; they are born amid hatred and rejection, and expect to die the same way.",
			"",
			"In rare instances, a scrag mother may produce flood troll twins. In keeping with their primitive superstitions, scrags believe the arrival of two flood trolls is a dire omen that signals the coming of storms and floods, and cannot be dealt with by simply tossing the younglings away. Instead, the scrags believe, in order to appease the dread deities that they believe control the weather and the flow of rivers into their aquatic homes, the scrags must raise aruk-taii twins, aruk-taikii, as they would raise their true scrag offspring. The scrag mother-along with the other female scrags in her group-raises and nurtures the twins as best as she is able, albeit with grudging reluctance. In fact, the association between aruk-taikii and inclement weather in these old scrag myths is what originally inspired human adventurers to name the beasts flood trolls.",
			"",
			"**Family:** [Troll](family/troll)",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"Flood trolls are monstrous nomads-wandering hunters who follow the herds of game and pay close attention to humanoids' travel patterns as they journey between the distant settlements of northern Avistan. They are cunning by necessity, since they are smaller than their brethren and must often surprise their prey to earn their meals. While not afraid to pounce on their victims once they can catch them, most flood trolls prefer to use stealth tactics and crude traps to put prospective victims in hazardous situations before attempting an ambush.",
			"",
			"Scrag mothers eject their flood troll spawn from the brood as soon as the youngling's hormonal mutation makes itself known, which typically occurs a couple of years after the brood is born. Abandoned aruk-taii younglings survive in the wilds by sticking close to a river or freshwater source, and those who fail to find fresh water typically fall prey to wolves or other predators. Solitary by circumstance, flood trolls are seen in pairs only rarely, and usually because the two are twins. Because flood troll twins are pampered and treated with care by their scrag mother (rather than being abused and ostracized), these specimens tend to be more intelligent and creative than their solitary kin. Some flood trolls even learn how to wield arms or poison daggers; woe betide anyone who feels the sting of an aruk-taii rogue's dirk-if not for the blade, then for the savage claws that come afterward.",
			"",
			"Because they can survive in arid environments for longer periods, flood trolls are much more common in Belkzen than their scrag forebears. The orcs of Belkzen claim that flood trolls wander over the Mindspin and Kodar mountain ranges, fleeing their scrag families in the Mushfens and Varisia's other wetlands. In the frigid Lands of the Linnorm Kings and Irrisen, scrags dwelling along the coast of the Arcadian Ocean and in Glacier Lake drive their flood troll offspring south along the Marbleflow River or east toward the Gullik River. While they are most commonly encountered in Avistan, flood trolls may be found around the world, wherever scrags carry the aruk-taii mutation, though their physical features vary somewhat depending on where they originate. The Zenj tribes of the Mwangi Expanse speak of blueskinned, humanoid horrors-jeburo in the Polyglot tongue-that stalk the jungle's riverbeds during the dry season and boldly attack villages as the storm season approaches. A number of these flood trolls make their way into the Sodden Lands. Never lacking for the rain that allows for their regeneration, these flood trolls terrorize the few remaining enclaves of humanity in that drenched land."

			"Though grotesque, charmless, and prone to fits of violence, mountain trolls are not inherently evil, nor do they always attack intruders on sight. A mountain troll prefers to withdraw and observe before entering combat, lumbering forth to attack only if intruders make clear their intentions to harm it or its allies, or if the newcomers seem to be encroaching upon the troll's territory rather than simply passing through. Once enraged, a mountain troll is a savage opponent, calling upon its native strength and alliances with elementals to bury its opponents in stone or spread their entrails across the slopes.",
			"",
			"Mountain trolls prefer to live in narrow ravines or shallow caves that allow them to look out over the landscape. They sometimes knuckle-walk like a gorilla, but when angered they rear up to their full height of nearly 30 feet. Mountain trolls have a close association with the First World, similar to that possessed by gnomes, which grants them magical abilities and unusual patience. They are quick to forge alliances with fey, and while they see smaller trolls as sadists, they nonetheless feel a sort of familial responsibility. Lesser trolls often capitalize upon mountain trolls' generosity, but take care to abide by their larger cousins' rules when sheltering in their homes. Mountain trolls have even been known to aid explorers or give advice, provided they are treated with respect.",

			"Rock trolls are relatives of normal trolls and ice trolls, but make their lairs far beneath the earth in underground caverns.

Rock trolls have stony skin studded with crystals, but otherwise display typical troll characteristics-hunched posture, long arms, a large underbite, and powerful regenerative abilities. Because of the crystalline nature of their skin, however, rock trolls prove more susceptible to sonic damage than other trolls, but they are able to regenerate even wounds dealt by fire. Rock trolls are larger and stronger than normal trolls, typically standing 15 to 16 feet tall in height, and weighing upward of 1,200 pounds.",
			"",
			"Rock trolls are fond of humanoid flesh, but eat whatever food they can get their claws on. Most underground creatures go out of their way to avoid rock trolls, as the ravenous creatures will eat anything that passes through their territory, as long as it is at least marginally edible. Rock trolls also occasionally eat rocks and minerals, though such fare seems to do little to soothe their voracious hungers. Instead, these minerals supplement the trolls' diet, strengthening their skin, teeth, and claws. Deposits of certain crystals seem especially tasty to rock trolls, and a rock troll who finds such a collection will often gorge himself on the crystalline delicacies.",

			"Sewer trolls are close relations to both common trolls and scrags. They are much smaller, however, only weighing around 200 pounds and reaching up to 6 feet tall. Like normal trolls, sewer trolls possess regenerative powers that allow them to recover from almost any wound and even regrow limbs, though these powers can be thwarted by fire or acid. Their regeneration is significantly slower than a normal troll's, however.",
			"",
			"Unlike the eyes of normal trolls, sewer trolls' eyes are so sensitive to light that they are momentarily blinded by bright lights. Their eyes absorb ambient light, which damages the slimy membrane that covers them. As the membrane regenerates, a strange reaction causes the eyes to glow orange.",
			"",
			"In addition to being smaller than normal trolls, sewer trolls are incredibly flexible and can squeeze through small spaces with ease. When the terrain is favorable, they hunt by ambushing prey from small spaces that don't appear capable of harboring a threat.",
			"",
			"Sewer trolls can eat almost anything, but prefer fresh meat, and like normal trolls they need a lot of food to power their regenerative abilities. Though they can subsist on subterranean fish, they prefer the warm blood and flesh of mammals.",
			"",
			"Sewer trolls tend to lair underground in areas with a large prey population or ample sources of other nutrients. While sewer trolls are common in some of the immense caves deep underground, their name derives from their lairs under the cities of the surface world. A major city often hosts dozens of the creatures, living in small family groups or lairing on their own. They rarely leave the sewers because of their light blindness, but they have been known to hide just below sewer grates and snatch children who walk too close. In times of desperate hunger, sewer trolls may leave the sewers, invariably at night. They stick to the shadows and ambush lone walkers, or sneak through windows to snatch babies from their cribs. Sewer trolls outside of their native environment are easily scared, but woe to the unprepared foe who follows them back into the sewers.",
			"",
			"Sewer trolls sometimes join groups of normal trolls or, being semi-aquatic, groups of scrags, to benefit from safety in numbers. Their smaller size and weakness mean they're often bullied by their more dangerous cousins, but many sewer trolls accept this as inevitable. They typically have to do menial chores, like collecting rodents to eat if bigger game is scarce, or being the first to venture into unexplored caves, in exchange for protection.",

			"A troll fury's first duty is to see to the welfare of her tribe, and to ensure its prosperity in the long term. Watching the lands around her carefully, monitoring the migration of game, and minding the lessons of her predecessors all let a troll fury anticipate times of plenty and times of need, and to stockpile or conserve as necessary. Though a troll fury never rushes into a decision that could endanger the tribe, she commands her own tribe or newcomers to their territory to move on if there's a risk that the hunting grounds will be overhunted. Wise tribes leave the area when she tells them to, but sometimes she must drive them away with fire and poison so the animals have time to repopulate.",
			"",
			"To a troll fury's mind, it's wiser to risk traveling to another land in the short term so exhausted lands can recover. This attitude, combined with her knowledge of natural environments, means she's the member of the tribe most likely to lead a migration. In larger tribes, a triumvirate or larger group of furies works together. Each concentrates on a particular area of expertise, but they all back one another up once one of them makes a decision that affects the tribe. This solidarity lets them cow even the most autocratic tribal leaders.",

Creatures bitten by a trollhound are often afflicted with bloodfire fever, a disease characterized by deep internal pain, as if the victim's blood were on fire. Additional symptoms include loss of muscular coordination, pus-filled blisters, and overall lethargy and fatigue. Trolls and trollhounds alike are immune to bloodfire fever, even though trollhounds often exhibit the pus-filled blisters that come with the disease.",

			"Slavering and voracious, trollhounds seem to be trolls in smaller canine form, and indeed, are often found as pets among gangs and tribes of trolls. Requiring vast amounts of food to fuel their regenerative metabolisms, packs of wild trollhounds range far and wide through the mountains of the north, their ravenous hunger driving them to hunt and consume any prey they can track down and kill.",
			"",
			"A typical trollhound stands 4 feet tall at the shoulder, has short but powerful legs, and weighs around 350 pounds. A trollhound's skin is somewhat scaly, with patches of rough, greenish-black fur. It has oversized jaws with a pronounced underbite, and its eyes are normally a dull, hateful orange.",
			"",
			"Trollhounds are believed to be the outcome of infusing particularly ferocious worgs with alchemically prepared troll blood. The resulting beast loses the worg's wicked intelligence but gains the ability to regenerate even the most grievous wounds, except those inflicted by fire or acid. Whatever their origin, trollhounds breed true and are often raised by trolls.",
			"",
			"Trollhounds are fearless on the hunt and in combat, relying on their ability to regenerate to carry them through. Not even the threat of fire is enough to repel them, as the beasts are too dull to recognize the danger it poses. Nevertheless, fire is one of the most effective tools in combating trollhounds, and canny hunters know to burn every last remnant of a slain trollhound, for as is true of trolls, even the smallest piece of trollhound flesh can eventually regrow back into a full-sized beast.",
			"",
			"Trollhounds are most often found in the company of trolls, who breed the beasts as hunters, guards, pets, and food. Trollhounds seem to have an affinity for their savage masters, and tamed trollhounds always regard trolls as alpha members of the pack. A trollhound will never attack a troll without cause-although trolls often enjoy violent roughhousing with these creatures nonetheless."
