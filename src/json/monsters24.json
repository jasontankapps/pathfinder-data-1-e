Their tails serve as potent secondary weapons, which they use to bludgeon particularly hardy opponents before tearing them limb from limb.",
			"",
			"Swamp barracuda thrive in the tropical waters surrounding the continent of Garund, and are particularly prominent throughout the Sodden Lands and Mwangi Expanse. To the north, they can occasionally be found in the Mushfens and the Varisian Gulf in the warmer months, heading south when winter cools the waters. While they normally hunt alone or in small groups, during their migratory season, massive schools of swamp barracuda can be spotted traveling down the western Avistani coastline, where they feed on small whales as well as terrestrial creatures that wander too close to their waters.",
			"",
			"While swamp barracuda are most often found in the wild, particularly daring hunters sometimes capture them to serve either as food or pets. Swamp barracuda can survive for a long time outside their preferred climates, but often grow lax and weak if their owners fail to feed them properly or don't take care of their holding tank. Magnimar's infamous Sczarni gang, the Gallowed, uses swamp barracuda as a coercion technique against wealthy patsies as well as borrowers who fail to make a payment on time (an act made difficult by the exorbitant interest rate the Gallowed put on any loans they give out). Called the Fish Tank by those who know of it, the saltwater aquarium that houses Jaster Frallino's precious barracuda is stored in a dilapidated blue caravan wagon owned by the Gallowed, and more than one failed business partner has lost an eye, toe, or hand to \"the Boss's Fish.\" It is also known that the Sczarni boss keeps a collection of rusty keys at the bottom of the Fish Tank, though the purpose of these mysterious items is a secret held by Frallino alone.",

While most swamp mummies are motivated by vengeance, many fulfill these dark yearnings in a more general sense. Filled with wrath and hatred for the living, they mercilessly attack any living creatures that dare to venture into their dismal domains. Their agonized moans echo over their putrid homes, driving away the natural animals dwelling therein and often alerting travelers to the relentless danger.",
			"",
			"Swamp mummies delight in infecting living foes with bog rot, believing that adding their victims' essence to their gloomy domains expands their power. After battle, they carry away the bodies of their fallen victims to sink them in deep, isolated pools. Thus, even enemies that escape the bog rot become one with the swamp mummy's home. Most swamp mummies are Medium humanoids, typically arising from the submerged corpses of human, lizardfolk, or elven victims-though instances of swamp mummies arising from the corpses of other races is not unknown."

			"",
			"Sylphs are humans whose family trees include elemental beings of air, such as djinn. They tend to be pale and thin to the point of appearing delicate, though their skinny bodies are more resilient than they look. While many can pass unnoticed through crowds of humans, sylphs display their heritage in subtle ways, and those who study them carefully sometimes notice that breezes seem to follow a sylph wherever she goes, even inside rooms with no windows. When consumed by fits of anger or passion, these tendencies become more apparent, as winds surround the sylph and tousle her hair or knock small items from shelves. Many sylphs have complex markings on their pale flesh that resemble tiny swirling designs like blue and gray tattoos, and the most exotic of their kind have hair that twists and coils almost as if it were made of living mist.",
			"",
			"As people, sylphs tend to be shy and reclusive, blending into crowds or skillfully avoiding those they don't desire to meet. Yet while they often prefer to manipulate situations and avoid conflict themselves, most sylphs remain intensely curious about other people, and often go to great lengths to spy or eavesdrop on those who spark their interest (a hobby frequently referred to as \"listening to the wind\"). This combined love of subterfuge and ability to slip away from any compromising situation makes sylphs perfectly suited to lives as rogues, thieves, and spies, and beneath the average sylph's veneer of shy waifishness lies a mind that's capable and calculating, constantly sizing up the competition and analyzing the most effective exits from any given room.",
			"",
			"### Sylph Characters",
			"",
			"Sylphs are defined by class levels-they do not possess racial Hit Dice. Sylphs have the following racial traits.",
			"",
			"**+2 Dexterity, +2 Intelligence, -2 Constitution:** Sylphs are quick and insightful, but slight and delicate.  ",
			"**Darkvision:** Sylphs can see in the dark up to 60 feet.  ",
			"**Sylph Magic:** Feather fall 1/day (caster level equals the sylph's Hit Dice).  ",
			"**Energy Resistance:** Sylphs have electricity resistance 5.  ",
			"**Air Affinity:** See above.  ",
			"**Languages:** Sylphs begin play speaking Common and Auran. Sylphs with high Intelligence scores can choose any of the following bonus languages: Aquan, Dwarven, Elven, Gnome, Halfling, Ignan, and Terran."

Despite being much smaller than its main head, the arm heads are possessed of unexpected strength for their size, making them equally deadly. These heads are also adept at manipulating objects, allowing the syricta to perform any action that would require a hand- such as holding a weapon- at the expense of those bite attacks.",

Most syrictas instead spend their lives serving their serpentfolk creators, rarely forming relationships with other syrictas.",

Taotiehs are used to ward sacred or secluded areas from enemies and trespassers. Their semblance to tigers extends even to the animal's abilities in combat, as taotiehs are feared for their vicious attacks. The extradimensional space at the core of a taotieh allows the construct to swallow opponents of its own size and then shunt its victims into an airless pocket of space inside. A creature capable of existing without air could well spend an eternity inside a taotieh if it couldn't smash its way out or escape via plane-traversing magic, in which case it must wait for outside forces to slay its captor. Tales abound of great treasures and even greater dangers being unleashed upon a taotieh's destruction.",

A creature that successfully saves against this effect is immune to the same tsaalgrend's spores for 24 hours. This is a mind-affecting fear and paralysis effect. The save DC is Constitution-based.",
			"",
			"#### Description",
			"",
			"A tsaalgrend is a predatory creature resembling a tangle of sturdy vines with jagged purple thorns. Its coloration is mottled with brown, green, and yellow mold patches that flake and fall as the creature writhes through the air. The tsaalgrend's vines barely conceal two translucent, gas-filled sacks that act as balloons, enabling it to float along above the ground. Two longer vines stretch from the creature's center, allowing the tsaalgrend to snare its prey. An opening filled with rows of spiky thorns, positioned on the creature's underside, serves as the creature's mouth. This orifice constantly emits a wet, rancid stench and a wheezing sigh as warm gas escapes from its floatation chambers.",
			"",
			"Tsaalgrends are complex, ambulatory fungi, but also symbiotically support a multitude of other molds, fungi, mosses, and epiphytes. The most powerful mold growing within tsaalgrends produces potent, hallucinogenic black spores. Tsaalgrends mainly use these fine spores for hunting, and they are capable of ejecting spores in a wide area to stun prey. Any creature that breathes in the spores is immediately subject to an overwhelming terror response as its mind floods with primal, animalistic fears. The victim's breathing becomes quick and shallow, its heart rate rises dramatically, and nearby sounds become dull over the rush of blood in its ears. The creature's mind begs to flee, but its muscles simply seize tight. Most victims find this experience maddening enough that their frustration and panic heighten the actual chemical effects of the tsaalgrends' spores.",
			"",
			"Daring alchemists occasionally hunt and trap tsaalgrends with the intention of harvesting the black spores from living specimens and using them to fabricate new and potent inhaled poisons. Securing a living tsaalgrend is important to the process, for the spores lose potency soon after they are released, making storage for later use impractical. Such alchemists often run afoul of fungus-focused druids, who commune with and protect these unusual plants.",
			"",
			"Tsaalgrends display a limited intelligence-easily on par with apes- and can overcome simple puzzles and challenges. They communicate basic concepts with each other through the deliberate transfer of spores. These bouts of communication involve bursts of various colors and scents, granting tsaalgrends with large and more varied symbiotic colonies something akin to leadership roles. Most often, tsaalgrends \"speak\" to each other to coordinate hunting efforts. The plants also respond to some spoken language, though they lack a well-developed sense of hearing and show difficulty differentiating any but the simplest words and phrases. Several distinct patches of stubby 1- or 2-inch growths track light and movement, essentially serving as eyes.",
			"",
			"A tsaalgrend typically grows to be over 3 feet long, and weighs about 40 pounds."

Other times they seem to appear spontaneously, often after their creators suffer traumatic experiences. More often than not, in these latter cases, the creators are children. Such a child witnesses something horrific or far too strange for her nascent imagination to comprehend, and ends up creating an imaginary friend to help her sort through the event and protect her from other potential dangers. While most of these imaginary friends are nothing more than figments of her mind, every so often they manifest as tulpas. Some such tulpas are noble creatures that protect the child who created them, but just as many are malicious entities that subtly torment the child or lead her astray.",
			"",
			"While a tulpa is a creature of thought created by the imagination of another being, it has a will and a mind of its own. This often leads to conflict between a tulpa and its creator. In order to protect itself from banishment or worse, a tulpa often attempts to compel others to think and concentrate on its existence. This allows the tulpa to create havens of other \"creators\" in case its original creator forgets about the tulpa or becomes incapacitated. Nonetheless, even a sadistic tulpa or a tulpa with an actively belligerent creator must protect its creator's life in order to preserve its own existence."

			"**Scrimshaw Magic (Sp)** When a tupilaq is created, its creator can inscribe a single spell he knows (as long as that spell is no higher than 2nd level and requires no material components) into the tupilaq as a complex scrimshaw design. The tupilaq gains the ability to use that spell as a spell-like ability (CL 7th) three times per day. The tupilaq's creator can inscribe a new spell onto the tupilaq if he wishes, replacing the previous scrimshaw. Inscribing a new scrimshaw requires 24 hours of work and an expenditure of 500 gp in materials. The tupilaq presented here utilizes invisibility in this manner. Erase can destroy a tupilaq's scrimshaw if it fails a Fortitude save against the spell. If a tupilaq's scrimshaw is removed in this manner, it loses access to the spell as a spell-like ability, and seeks out its creator to attack and kill him. The tupilaq's creator becomes the target of the tupilaq's seek target ability in this case. If a tupilaq's creator is already dead, the tupilaq instead seeks out the nearest living creature and attacks this new target on sight, continuing this spree of murder until it is itself destroyed.",
			"",
			"**Seek Target (Su)** A tupilaq's creator can place a drop of blood, lock of hair, or other portion of a creature's body in the tupilaq's maw as a standard action. From that point on, the tupilaq constantly knows what direction that creature is located in, and gains a +20 insight bonus on all Perception checks made to locate the creature. A new target cannot be assigned to a tupilaq in this manner until its previous target is dead.",
			"",
			"**Shearing Jaws (Ex)** All tupilaqs are crafted with oversized jaws capable of tearing and pulling. A tupilaq applies twice its Strength modifier to damage with a successful bite attack and threatens a critical hit on a roll of 19-20. A tupilaq is treated as Large for all checks made to move a grappled opponent.",

			"Tupilaqs are small constructs crafted out of whale bones and whale teeth for the sole purpose of murdering the creator's enemies. A tupilaq's appearance can vary based on its construction, but all have prominent jaws and a small body with hands and feet fit for swimming. A tupilaq usually stands 3 feet tall and weighs only 30 pounds.",
			"",
			"Tupilaqs must be created in secrecy-if any other person discovers the tupilaq is being created, the attempt to build the construct immediately fails. As part of its creation, the creator invites or lures a host spirit to possess the tupilaq. Most often, the animus of a tupilaq is that of a dead child or other small humanoid, and the parity of size between the new vessel and the spirit's previous body is what gives the creature a speed and agility on land and in water that is atypical for most constructs. This trapped spirit is also what makes a tupilaq so savage and murderous.",

			"There is a common myth among many far-flung tribes of a great and regal bird who comes sometimes with prophecy and other times as a savior for a great hero. These majestic creatures are both stern and benevolent, using their power to scatter a tribe's foes or to herald great eras of prosperity. To benefit from the being's attention, the leaders of the tribe must acquiesce to the bird's demands, which typically include accomplishing some difficult quest to which the bird's enigmatic prophecies allude. While sometimes these radiant messengers are phoenixes, occasionally they are a rarer sort of prophet- majestic birdlike creatures from the Positive Energy Plane known as turuls.",
			"",
			"Turuls often treat the Material Plane as a hunting ground, where they might feed upon wild beasts or hunt undead and other creatures that wantonly spread mayhem. Such hunters keep to themselves, avoiding other creatures, but other turuls take a more active role with peaceful, intelligent creatures. While a few turuls go so far as to portray themselves as deities, granting protection and healing in return for worship, most of these magnificent outsiders watch from a distance, treating their chosen tribe more like pets, meddling only when their favorites are threatened or in the midst of dire circumstances.",
			"",
			"While many turuls enjoy their forays on the Material Plane, the massive avians are intrinsically tied to the Positive Energy Plane. They also seem to be somehow related to the jyoti-another race of avian natives of the Positive Energy Plane-though neither turuls nor jyoti care to divulge the true nature of the relationship. Some scholars of the outer planes suggest that the two avian species are actually incarnations of the same genesis, while others postulate that turuls are some higher form of jyoti within a cycle of reincarnation intrinsic to many of the Positive Energy Plane's denizens. Both theories are mere speculation.",
			"",
			"Unlike the more social jyoti, turuls tend to be loners. They keep company for short periods of time, either to mate or purely for the enjoyment of one another's company, but such couplings last for a few decades at most. Instead of dwelling in crystalline cities like the jyoti, turuls roost at the tops of tree-shaped gemstone formations that spring up from the landscape of their home plane. Turuls are haughty but talkative and sometimes welcome visitors. They perch silently upon their crystal trees, taking time to speak to any who approach them, so long as they find the conversation worthwhile. As soon as they lose interest, they politely dismiss themselves or their guests. Those who don't leave are typically met with scorn if not aggression. Turuls are not used to or fond of being ignored or insulted.",
			"",
			"In stark contrast to the jyoti, the turuls hold no hatred or ill will toward deities and their servants, at least when they encounter such creatures on planes other than the Positive Energy Plane. While on the Material Plane, turuls will even work with good- and neutral-aligned outsiders to protect their hunting grounds and adopted humanoid communities.",
			"",
			"In rare circumstances, a turul dwells at the heart of a jyoti crystal city, supervising these settlements from atop their eyries as ever-vigilant protectors. Those who do become more like the jyoti over time, and treat outsiders with the same anger and vehemence as their wards. Such arrangements are typically short-lived, though. Turuls who live with jyoti only do so for a century at most, and when they leave, their personalities and relations with others revert to a more calm and contemplative manner. Such might hint at some arrangement wherein a turul agrees to become part of a jyoti community, living by their rules for a period in return for something the turul covets - such as mystical knowledge, information about egress to the Material Plane, or possibly one of the artifacts that the jyoti hoard.",
			"",
			"The most consistent relationship the turuls have is with phoenixes. Those fiery avians often treat turuls like royalty and willingly serve them, whether or not the turul has expressed any interest in gaining a flaming entourage. Though, for all their impatience with other creatures, turuls tolerate the presence of phoenixes better than they do others.",
			"",
			"Part of turuls' legendary moodiness stems from the same myths for which they're best known-those wherein they bring prophecies of light and peace. On some Material Plane worlds, such tales are so pervasive that mortal heroes go as far as venturing to the Positive Energy Plane to seek blessings and wisdom from turuls. The great avians have little patience for those who presume upon their occasional benevolence. Not only that, but a turul's prophecies are not merely boons to be meted out. Rather, their promises of peace and prosperity typically come about via changes they've affected using their own considerable power, or as inevitabilities they've had the foresight to predict. In the rarest of cases, some turuls claim to have communed with the power of the deepest Positive Energy Plane and that they serve as messengers of that mysterious cosmic will. Whether or not such is true few can know, but that possibility has certainly influenced the greatest variety of mortal myths regarding turuls.",
			"",
			"Gigantic in stature, turuls stand nearly 30 feet tall and have a wingspan of almost 50 feet. They weigh upwards of 15 tons. While they reside on the Positive Energy Plane, turuls are effectively immortal. They age only when traveling from their home plane."

			"**Lure (Su)** If a tuyewera possesses a stolen tongue (see steal tongue ability), it can lure creatures into a trancelike state and compel them to approach as a standard action. When a tuyewera uses its lure, it must target an intelligent creature within 120 feet to which it has line of effect (but not necessarily line of sight). The tuyewera must concentrate to maintain the lure's effects. It then calls out to the creature, beckoning it to approach. The target can resist this lure by making a successful DC 15 Will save, after which that target is immune to that tuyewera's lure ability until the tuyewera gains a different tongue. If the tuyewera uses the target's name during the lure, the target suffers a -2 penalty on the Will save. If the target fails, she becomes fascinated and attempts to approach the tuyewera by the shortest, safest route possible. Once the target is adjacent to the tuyewera, she remains motionless and offers no resistance to the undead's attacks (although once the tuyewera attacks, it ceases concentration and the victim is free to act, assuming she survives the monster's attack). This is a sonic mind-affecting charm effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.",
			"",
			"**Suffocation (Su)** A tuyewera does not breathe itself, but it can attempt to steal the breath of a helpless, fascinated, or stunned adjacent creature as a standard action. When the tuyewera attempts this, it moves its mouth next to the victim's mouth and inhales, drawing the victim's breath out of her body. The victim can attempt to resist this attack by making a DC 15 Fortitude save. If she fails, the victim is stunned for 1 round and begins to suffocate. The victim falls unconscious on the second round, drops to -1 hit points on the third, and dies of suffocation on the fourth. Each round, the victim may attempt a new DC 15 Fortitude save to end the suffocation effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.",

			"**Steal Tongue (Su)** A tuyewera does not possess a tongue of its own when it is created-it must steal a tongue from a recently slain (no more than 1 day ago) creature before it can speak, attack with its tongue, or use its lure or constriction attacks. Stealing a tongue is a full-round action, after which the stolen tongue merges with the tuyewera's jaw. The tuyewera gains the ability to speak and understand all of the languages known by the dead body from which the tongue was harvested, and its voice sounds exactly like that of the dead creature while it still lived. The monster's new tongue is a dangerous weapon as well, and can extend to a length of nearly 5 feet to attack and constrict foes. A stolen tongue only lasts until the next sunrise, after which it rots away to corruption in a single round, forcing the tuyewera to seek out a replacement before it regains its speech and attacks.",

Invisible during the day, a tuyewera can be sent into an enemy's lair to perform any number of missions desired by its creator or master. A tuyewera that lacks a master is a free-willed undead-in wilderness regions, it wanders aimlessly, constantly searching for signs of civilization. If it finds such signs, it invariably seeks out a graveyard and lurks in hiding, waiting for a new body to be buried so that it can burrow into the grave and steal the corpse's tongue at the first opportunity.

Something to do with the preparation method and the medicines used simply doesn't translate to non-humanoid bodies-although the unique undead created by such methods could have a variety of powers, they are not truly tuyeweras.

You can simply apply the giant creature simple template, but a better solution in this case is to rebuild the tuyewera with all of the appropriate changes to its stats-whenever a tuyewera's Hit Dice grant it an ability score increase, it increases its Charisma score.

			"### Creating",
			"",
			"A tuyewera can be created via the create undead spell, so long as the caster undertakes a specialized ritual as part of the casting. The body to be transformed into a tuyewera must be that of a humanoid the caster has himself slain at some point in the last 3 days. The spellcaster must be at least 13th level to create a tuyewera. Before the spellcasting begins, the caster must prepare the body by removing the corpse's tongue and severing its legs at the knees. The actual casting of the spell requires the caster to anoint the tuyewera's severed limbs and tongue with special medicines. These discarded body parts must then be burnt to ashes so that when the tuyewera rises from the dead, it does not recognize its missing limbs and tongue (if it does, it immediately attacks its creator). When the spell is complete, the newly created tuyewera is loyal to its creator and follows his spoken commands as long as the caster wears or carries a small pouch containing a handful of the ashes from the tuyewera's burnt limbs and tongue on his person. If the caster ever loses this pouch, the tuyewera becomes uncontrolled. If a tuyewera ever sees the ashes, it immediately recognizes them and seeks out its creator unerringly (as if via locate creature, but with no range limitation) and attempts to kill him- preferably as the creator sleeps."

Twigjacks sometimes go out of their way to impress dryads, an effort that is rebuffed almost every time.

Leaves and sprigs of new growth randomly sprout from the creature's body."

			"Not all the creatures of Hell are devils. Descended from vermin that came to be trapped in Hell, typhilipedes embody the corruptive might and terrible hungers that brood in the dark. Usually encountered as wriggling, clacking masses of insectoid legs and flapping wings, these creatures strike fear in the weaker souls that trespass within the Pit. Typhilipedes possess night-black, segmented bodies with dozens of scraping, skittering legs. Two pairs of batlike wings sprout from between body segments closer to the creature's head, which bears two pairs of eyes and oversized mandibles glistening with sickly ichor.",
			"",
			"A typhilipede typically measures 2 to 3 feet in length and rises no more than 8 inches from the ground, though its 3-foot wingspan can lift it off the ground with only minor difficulty. A single typhilipede weighs about 10 pounds.",
			"",
			"Typhilipedes have a legendary reputation in Erebus, where it's said they hail from a place called the Wax Tower. Supposedly, this particular vault is a vast echo chamber, alive with the deafening drone of an impossibly large typhilipede swarm. At the vast space's center rises an organic-looking tower of incredible height. Millions of typhilipedes burrow into the tower's callouslike exterior, creating a network of tunnels and caverns where primordial, endlessly fecund typhilipede progenitors are said to dwell. At the tower's endlessly rising summit burns a tiny, unquenchable flame. Supposedly the entire tower was once just a single candle that an innocent mortal begged the gods to keep burning eternally. The gods granted the request, but as the candle burned, its wax dripped endlessly. In the aftermath of the resulting disaster, Asmodeus volunteered to deal with the candle. The taper that would become the Wax Tower was installed in Erebus, along with a few unfortunate gnats that had become trapped in the wax. Over ages of exposure to the darkness of Erebus and the corruption of Hell, those crawling things transformed into the first typhilipedes.",
			"",
			"Now, typhilipedes are native to Erebus, though small colonies occasionally slip into the tunnels of the Darklands. In both places, they are considered pests, akin to otherworldly forms of giant rats or monstrous spiders. Typhilipedes most often hunt the lightless depths of Erebus for unwary souls and creatures of flesh. While capable of hunting on their own, typhilipedes usually hunt in teeming masses, swarming over whatever prey they encounter and devouring it. Despite the zeal with which they tear other creatures apart, typhilipedes prefer to consume the raw energy of light. This makes their presence convenient to the other inhabitants in the cavernous vaults of Erebus, where vast treasures lie cloaked in darkness like nothing known on the Material Plane. As the denizens of Erebus rarely have any need for light-and suffer its presence with displeasure- typhilipedes can easily distinguish their prey, spotting even a candle's flicker from miles away and pursuing it relentlessly. One typhilipede spotting a source of light and winging toward it is often enough to set an entire swarm on the hunt.",
			"",
			"Especially in secluded corners of the Darklands, where droves of typhilipedes occasionally flourish, these creatures are often known as \"eye biters.\" While the name might reference their tendency to plunge their victims into darkness before eating them, the nickname just as likely derives from the effects of the venom they produce. Survivors of typhilipede poison report feeling as though their eyes were on fire. Many also claim their experience with color changed dramatically as a result, with warm shades seeming to catch fire, becoming almost painfully vivid and certainly uncomfortable to look at. While these optical effects don't inhibit the victim's visual acuity, many survivors claim to be wary of bright lights and colors for weeks after shaking off the venom's effects.",
			"",
			"While typhilipede venom is not usually deadly on its own, it is valued for its rarity. A single dose often sells for 1,500 gp or more in nefarious markets around the Inner Sea. Some Darklands alchemists believe that mixing typhilipede venom with the blood of goodaligned outsiders can make the poison much more debilitating-though the exact process by which this is possible remains elusive.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"Beyond Erebus, typhilipedes are occasionally found in the Darklands realms of Orv and Sekamina, but they rarely venture closer to the surface than that. Given their ability to gain nourishment from light, many assume that typhilipedes flourish in areas of bright sunlight. In fact, overwhelming sources of bright light- especially sunlight-repel the creatures, forcing them into regions of absolute darkness.",
			"",
			"Typhilipedes don't form communities or social bonds as more intelligent beings do. Instead, they tend to clump together, forming colonies akin to those of cockroaches. When hunting, they behave in a manner similar to a swarm, utilizing knowledge of the terrain to intercept prey and separate individuals from larger groups. Once they have surrounded a target, they attack en masse. Upon bringing down their prey, typhilipedes eat as a group. Typhilipede young and pregnant individuals eat first, as the hunters instinctively prioritize the groups' long-term survival over that of any individual. Hunters eat next, with the sickly and wounded eating last. Typically, typhilipedes that are debilitated in battle try to sacrifice themselves for the good of the group. Those that face excessive wounds but still survive, though, often try to slink away into the darkness to quietly die. Few have the chance to indulge such a fate, though, as typhilipedes have an innate understanding of their own bodies and what they can survive. If no enemies are present and it becomes clear that one of their number bears a wound that will never heal, a typhilipede swarm quickly turns on the individual, enthusiastically cannibalizing it. Peculiarly, after consuming one of their own kind, typhilipedes typically stack the remains in a neat heap with the gnawed skull deliberately placed on top.",
			"",
			"A typhilipede can be summoned as a familiar by a 7th-level spellcaster with an alignment up to one step away from lawful evil who has the Improved Familiar feat. Duergar spellcasters in particular favor typhilipede familiars, and many view possessing one-especially an overweight specimen-as a symbol of status."

Whether or not such theories were true is up for debate, but those felid creatures that did rise from death with their masters were indeed beasts to be reckoned with, and a sizeable pack of the mummified things could very well spell the end for would-be tomb raiders. Ranging from tiny housecats to desert-roaming mountain lions, the feline enshrined with a deceased pharaoh varied in type depending on the predilections of its master, but all were known to be significantly more powerful than their living iterations."

			"South of Jalmeray, deep in the Yogisa Trench in the middle of the Obari Ocean, the terrifying gutaki known as Ugash-Iram lords over the underwater city of Achom. Ugash-Iram and its lesser kin practice foul rites and perform horrible rituals to honor their patron deity, Dagon, amid the city's strange and twisted spires, which rise out of a dark fissure in the seabed like claws climbing toward the surface. Crackling eruptions of magical energy briefly illuminate the city in flashes of light, but it is otherwise as dark and lightless as the souls of its foul inhabitants.",
			"",
			"Because of its isolation in the deepest waters of the Obari Ocean, few surface-dwellers know of Ugash-Iram's existence, though those fisherfolk and sailors who've heard tales of the mighty being know to fear it. Locathah sages place the indomitable gutaki's age at over 3,000 years old, and dwellers in the underwater regions surrounding Achom have long loathed and feared Ugash-Iram, whose legions of devotees have spelled the ruin of countless aquatic cities. Ugash-Iram itself is responsible for destroying a dozen massive underwater cities in the past millennium, and the scattered ruins that lie around the Yogisa Trench serve as testament to its power.",
			"",
			"Those aquatic creatures Ugash-Iram doesn't outright annihilate are captured and integrated into Achom either as members of the slave caste or as converted devotees to Dagon. Entire tribes of sahuagin, adaros, and iku-tursos have united under the banner of Ugash-Iram and its gutaki kin in Achom, and the underwater metropolis bulges at the borders with the thousands of evil inhabitants who make their home there. These inhabitants raid for Ugash-Iram and populate its city, protecting Achom and performing all kinds of menial tasks for their overlord. With these minions, Ugash-Iram's deadly reach extends all the way to the surface of the Obari Ocean and even the nearby shores of Geb, Jalmeray, and Qadira.",
			"",
			"Isolated in its flooded metropolis beneath the sea, Ugash-Iram has plenty of resources, a generous life span, and thousands of minions at its disposal, making it a formidable foe for any who would seek to stop the despotic gutaki before its influence spreads even further.",
			"",
			"### Infamous Deeds",
			"",
			"The legends of Ugash-Iram remain shrouded in mystery, since few aquatic humanoids have seen the monster, and fewer still have lived to tell the tale. Some claim that the gutaki gained its power by devouring other gutaki, gaining greater power and its array of 12 tentacles.",
			"",
			"One especially strange tale claims Ugash-Iram once captured a great kraken and imprisoned it deep in the gaping Yogisa Trench. Ugash-Iram is said to keep the behemoth perpetually on the brink of death-the gutaki and its minions carefully torture the kraken and subject it to grotesque experiments and disfiguring transformations. Just as gutaki were supposedly born when Dagon defeated the great kraken Kaktora, Ugash-Iram hopes that by subjecting its captured kraken to cruel experiments, it can create its own race of 12-tentacled followers.",
			"",
			"While ships crossing the middle of the Obari Ocean face all manner of risks, perhaps the worst is capture by Ugash-Iram's minions. Records tell of a combined effort by Ugash-Iram's adaro and sahuagin soldiers to capture a diplomatic fleet from Vudra some years ago. A dozen lucky sailors perished during the raid; the aquatic horrors captured everyone else, smearing them with a magical jelly that allowed them to breathe underwater and dragging them to Achom for torture, experimentation, and eventual sacrifice to their lord Dagon.",
			"",
			"### Adventure Hooks",
			"",
			"Tracking Ugash-Iram down is not a task for the faint of heart, and those who do manage to find the vile underwater metropolis of Achom would do well to stay away. Despite the danger, adventurers might find any number of reasons to explore the foul settlement and face its cruel inhabitants.",
			"",
			"- A tribe of adaro aligned with Ugash-Iram of Achom threatens Vudrani vessels bound for Jalmeray. At risk of losing their precious cargo, merchants send word to ports along the Obari Ocean's shores, searching for a group to deal with the adaro threat and determine their true motives.",
			"- Tired of living in fear of Ugash-Iram, locathah, merfolk, cecaelias, and other non-evil aquatic creatures recently formed a congress to address the gutaki's tyranny. Legends tell of a magical device of unknown origin lost within the Obari Ocean south of Stonespire Island. Thought to be capable of blocking out mental domination-among other powers-this device would prove a great weapon in the fight against Ugash-Iram and the other denizens of Achom. The aquatic council has put out a great bounty for retrieval of the item."

			"",
			"**Flechette Spray (Ex)** An ugothokra can fire bursts of calcified bone and horn from the vents along its abdomen. All six vents can fire as part of a full-attack action, or it can fire one vent as a standard action. This attack has a range increment of 50 feet. An ugothokra generates the \"ammunition\" it uses for this attack internally by feeding on organic material, and effectively has an unlimited supply of flechette material at any one time, but an ugothokra that is currently starving can't use this attack until at least 1 hour after feeding.",
			"",
			"**Infected Blood (Ex)** A creature that damages an ugothokra with a slashing or piercing melee weapon (regardless of how often the ugothokra is damaged) must succeed at a DC 20 Reflex saving throw at the end of its turn or be sprayed by the ugothokra's infected blood. A creature that damages an ugothokra with a slashing or piercing natural weapon automatically fails this saving throw. On a failed saving throw, the creature is exposed to a random viral infection (see below), but gains a +4 bonus on the Fortitude save to resist contracting whatever disease it is exposed to. Unlike when a victim contracts an infection from an ugothokra's flechette spray, diseases caught via contact with the monster's blood have normal onset times as determined by the disease in question.

			"",
			"**Viral Infection (Su)** An ugothokra's body is infested with numerous potent and highly infectious diseases engineered by their Dominion creators to cause highly specific conditions in those they infect. An ugothokra's blood carries these diseases, and while the creature can transmit random infections by means of contact with its blood, the most efficient method of transmission is via its flechette spray. Most ugothokras carry the following three contagions in their systems, and they can decide which one to inflict on a target as part of the act of firing a flechette spray-it can even inflict different diseases with different sprays in the same round if it so chooses. Some ugothokras carry additional viral infections that are tailored by their Dominion creators for incredibly specialized tasks. A creature exposed to any of these viral infections can resist the infection with a successful DC 19 Fortitude save, but on a failed save, the effect occurs immediately and the onset time is ignored. Contracting an infection via the ugothokra's blood is not as efficient and uses the listed onset time. The most common viral infections available to an ugothokra are listed below.",
			"",
			"Aklo Submission: Disease-injury or contact; save Fort DC 19; onset 1 day; frequency 1/day; effect 1d2 Wisdom drain (can't drain Wisdom below 0) plus susceptibility to Aklo; cure 2 consecutive saves. As long as a creature is infected with this disease (even if the creature isn't currently suffering any Wisdom drain from the disease), it becomes unusually compliant and responsive to commands issued to it in Aklo. Any Bluff, Diplomacy, or Intimidate check attempted against the character while speaking in Aklo gains a +4 bonus. Furthermore, as a full-round action, any creature can issue a command to the victim in Aklo to attempt to affect the victim with a suggestion effect (effective CL 5th, regardless of the commander's level)-the victim can resist this suggestion with a successful DC 14 Will save. Once a victim of Aklo submission succeeds at a Will save to resist such a suggestion, it can't be further affected in this way by any Aklo-speaking creature for 24 hours.",
			"",
			"Flesh Ripen Fever: Disease-injury or contact; save Fort DC 19; onset 1d4 days; frequency 1/day; effect 1d3 Con damage plus stench; cure 2 consecutive saves. A character suffering from flesh ripen fever exudes a nauseating stench as his skin decays and sloughs off, leaving behind reeking pits of stinking flesh. The victim is automatically sickened by its own smell, as are all creatures within a 10-foot radius. A successful DC 14 Fortitude save allows a creature to ignore the sickening effect for 24 hours-the victim of flesh ripen fever doesn't get such a saving throw to avoid being sickened. This stench is a poison effect that doesn't affect creatures associated with the Dominion of the Black.",

This insidious sickness is particularly devastating to creatures with cybernetic implants. Such creatures take a -2 penalty on all saving throws attempted to resist this disease. Further, each time a saving throw to resist its effect is attempted and failed, the creature takes 2d6 points of damage and loses the use of one randomly selected cybernetic implant for 24 hours.",
			"",

			"One of many artificially engineered species grown and molded in Dominion of the Black labs, ugothokras were designed specifically to spread contagions through organic enemy ranks. Immune to disease, ugothokras have small bodies that are capable of hosting a limitless number of contagions within their blood.",
			"",
			"Ugothokras are incapable of reproduction, and when additional ones are required by the Dominion of the Black, replacements are constructed from organic and cybernetic components. The construction facilities typically operate within the organic walls of Dominion installations, the little beasts crawling out from birthing tubes protruding from their semi-organic incubators. These incubators are of widely varying size and capacity. Smaller versions, possessing no more than two birthing tubes, can produce an ugothokra every hour if provided the proper nutrients (typically curdled flesh harvested from victims of flesh ripen fever), fed to it through the living walls in which the incubator is nestled. Significantly larger incubators with dozens of birthing tubes have been reported, their size limited only by the resources needed to create more offspring.",
			"",
			"A newborn ugothokra is completely autonomous and fully functional. While ugothokras can't fly, their immunity to cold and the fact that they don't breathe make them ideal bioweapons for use against enemy vessels in space-often, a Dominion ship's exterior swarms with ugothokras, and as they near an enemy ship, dozens of the tenacious aberrations drop off to cling to the enemy's hull. The creatures skitter along surfaces, searching for points of entry so they can infect the vessel's crew and spread their sickness. Often, these entry points are created for them via battle damage from other Dominion weaponry. Many Dominion ships have had great success at using ugothokras to spread Aklo submission among enemy crews, allowing the Dominion to order their victims to power down and submit. Those that manage to resist still typically fall under the grinding legs and mouth parts of swarms of ugothokras.",
			"",
			"Rumors of variant ugothokras abound, including swarms or larger varieties, and those possessing even more potent and deadly diseases. Given the prodigious industry of the Dominion of the Black, such rumors hardly seem far fetched.",
			"",
			"An ugothokra stands only about 2 1/2 feet tall, with a leg span approaching 6 feet. Most weigh around 150 pounds."

Umbral shepherds also serve as specialized torturers, with their ability to create bloodless cavities and tunnels through a prisoner's body with a touch of their horrible, burrowing tentacles.",
			"",
			"Whether Zon-Kuthon created the umbral shepherds or simply discovered and adopted them into his faith is unclear, but the shadowy parasites are irreversibly linked to both him and their home plane. Though they lust for the chance to spread their worship elsewhere, exposure to the light and energy of other planes is extremely harmful to them, thus necessitating the use of host bodies. Umbral shepherds value their hosts as vehicles but ultimately see them as disposable, knowing that without powerful magic their vessels will gradually sicken and die. An umbral shepherd that believes its vessel is close to death almost always abandons it rather than risking death itself, and usually transfers to a new host.",
			"",
			"In their natural state, umbral shepherds are shaped like limbless, demon-faced humans made of coherent shadow, and are capable of spawning any number of tentacles of varying sizes. Some religious scholars believe that the first Joyful Things may have been attempts by Kuthites to change themselves into something closer to the shepherds, yet this remains the unsubstantiated speculation of outsiders."

Legend or no, the undead are a very real hazard in the archipelago and one of the reasons why so many sailors hate and fear sailing in supposedly haunted waters at night, when most ghost ship sightings occur. In most cases, crews of such ships are made up of corporeal undead, especially draugr and draugr captains, though lacedons and wights are also prevalent undead on the high seas. The driving force behind most ghost vessels is a bottomless hatred for all things living, and most seafaring undead seek souls upon which they can vent their undying malice. The stat blocks presented here represent a typical crew of a ghost ship, but countless other combinations exist.",
			"",

A number of her wraith spawn attend her constantly, flitting about her obsequiously.",

			"Mark of Yunnarius: This agile sloop is captained by Emalynday (CE female elf banshee sorcerer 5), an astonishingly bitter and odious spirit who leads a crew composed entirely of undead elves. Three undead male elven archers known as the Unsung Three prowl the ship's decks, wielding magical bows rumored to be artifacts unearthed from a musty Ghol-Gan tomb. It is said the crew members of any vessel unlucky enough to cross paths with the Mark of Yunnarius feel the sting of the Unsung Three's arrows before even sighting the dread sloop.",
			"",
			"Nightclaw: This rat-infested frigate is the ship of the vampire Holaux the Gaunt (CE male human vampire antipaladin 10). Once a lieutenant of Raugsmauda, he escaped the lich's service and crewed his ship entirely with pirates made into his vampire spawn. Legend has it he was once a paladin of Iomedae, but turned to evil with the tragic death of his beloved wife, Sabina. Holaux wears a locket that bears her painted silhouette and contains a lock of her hair-some say that this keepsake enables him to withstand the light of the sun, while others claim that until the locket is taken from him he cannot be destroyed.",
			"",
			"### Ghost Ship Haunts",
			"",
			"Many ghost ships take the form of a haunt, usually triggered by a ship sailing at night into an oceanic region hexed by some maritime tragedy or particularly terrible event. The most common effects of these haunts are fear-related, though some of these ocean-bound terror-traps inflict various curses upon victims, such as rotting diseases, premature aging, or permanent physical debilitations. Some haunts are known to place a powerful geas on those ships that run afoul of them, requiring that their crews complete some task before being freed of a dreadful blight. Destruction of these haunts is often extremely difficult, as the bodies of the restless spirits that perpetuate such curses usually lie at the bottom of the sea or have drifted ashore on remote islands. Some sea haunts are tied to a specific date denoting the anniversary of a tragedy near a particular point in the ocean, and thus may not reset for an entire year. Such commemorative haunts tend to be more feared and dangerous to mariners, especially since the bodies or treasures such haunts are anchored to are sometimes dragged by the tides far from where the original event that triggered the haunt occurred."

			"Willful fugitives of the Negative Energy Plane's dread gravity, phantoms are escaped souls of humanoid creatures in desperate search of a psychically attuned being with whom to merge-such a merger creates a spiritualist. Every phantom harbors a strong emotion that tears it from the normal path of souls seeking final judgment and reward. This dominant emotion empowers the phantom's slam attack and can manifest in more potent forms when this creature merges with a spiritualist, but it also serves as a weight that drags the phantom into the Ethereal Plane and toward the Negative Energy Plane. Until an unfettered phantom finds a refuge, it is a frantic and shifting thing, a desperate creature of raw emotion and need."

They allow good and neutral creatures to pass through, hunt for food, or reside in their woods unharmed, but evil creatures and those who damage the local ecosystem more than necessary through sport hunting or commercial logging are swiftly driven out or killed. On rare occasions, lone unicorns without mates or whose partners have been slain have been known to adopt young women of exceptionally pure virtue as surrogates, allowing the women to ride on their backs and becoming their guardians and protectors for life. This bond generally ends amiably if the woman becomes more committed to someone else-such as a lover or child-giving rise to the myth that unicorns only befriend virgins.",
			"",
			"A unicorn's horn is the focus for its powers, and in order to use its spell-like abilities on other creatures the unicorn must touch them with it. Evil creatures greatly value unicorn horns as reagents for healing potions and other dark rites, and a single powdered unicorn horn counts as 1,600 gp when used as a component for crafting healing magic."

Many urdefhans crew ocean-going vessels for their people, treading a thin line between marines and pirates. Their crimson-sailed ships ply the Sightless Sea deep below Golarion's surface to impose daemonic law on foreign shores, press other sailors into service-albeit briefly before working or torturing them to death-and sink any vessel that shows the audacity to resist being boarded and \"inspected.\" Inclined as they are towards suffering (both their own and that of others), some independent urdefhans also sail the Sightless Sea and other bodies of water in the Darklands as freebooters or traders, but only the most depraved, strongest, and most foolhardy of other races would dare sign on with such a grotesque crew.",
			"",
			"Thanks to their years spent on rolling decks and in tight quarters, urdefhan sailors are faster and more dexterous than the landlubber soldiers of their empire, and all the more vicious and desperate in battle for their lack of overwhelming reinforcements. Their vessels, which are freely traded between urdefhans whenever they find port, are floating sanctuaries of disease and torture and are chronically undersupplied. Crew members eat only by claiming the cargo and passengers aboard the enemy ships they raid; conveniently, to the urdefhans, everyone is an enemy. When these stolen supplies run dry, crew members readily devour the flesh of weaker shipmates to continue their grim voyages of theft, conquest, and slaughter."

If the host body is slain, the urhag emerges as a free action but is staggered for 1 round. Otherwise, this effect lasts for 3 days or until the urhag emerges as a standard action. When the effect ends or the urhag emerges, the corpse collapses into rotten scraps of infected flesh. Anyone who touches these scraps is exposed to red plague.

Their grasping forearms each end in a sharp pincer capable of shearing flesh from bone, and shaggy fur covers the majority of their bodies. The ursikka's most unusual trait, however, is a three-part maw that can open wide enough to swallow humans whole. Freezing saliva drips constantly from these gnashing mandibles, injuring and trapping prey. With only a bestial intellect, ursikka view all smaller creatures as food, and think nothing of invading and devouring entire humanoid communities."

Much of a vampiric mist's time is spent seeking prey-a pursuit that the monster often shows great creativity in accomplishing. The creatures' propensity for taking on vague, skeletal forms of the creatures whose blood they drink only further adds to their mystique and fuels rumors that they have connections to the undead. Indeed, many vampiric mists enjoy using this common misconception to their advantage, causing foes to use foolish tactics-such as tricking spellcasters into using positive energy against them as if they were undead monsters."

These hideous monsters come from the fiendish outer planes, where they flop and flap through strange and haunted skies in constant search of fresh souls to torment. In these nightmare realms, vargouilles play a role similar to that of a raven or vulture, although they augment these roles with a malevolent delight in causing pain and anguish that no scavenger bird could ever hope to match.",

			"A vargouille's low power and hideous method of reproduction make for a dangerous combination. Vargouilles are relatively easy to summon to the Material Plane, and once here, they can swiftly reproduce, creating more and more of their hideous kind from those who fall victim to their kiss. Vargouilles created on the Material Plane in this manner are still extraplanar creatures, and as such can be banished with the right magic."

They simply leave the bodies to rot or-for particularly sadistic or desperate veds-use the corpses as bait for catching wild game.",

These giants can expel air from their lungs in a mighty blast, extinguishing small fires and knocking prone any who stand before them.

			"Vegepygmys are created by a dangerous fungus known as russet mold-creatures slain by russet mold serve as incubators for the mold's spores, and a day later, the dead body bursts to release 1d6 fully grown vegepygmys. A vegepygmy has no real relation to the body from which it emerges, but the creature may yet retain a strange sort of reverence for its \"birth corpse\" and carry with it a grisly memento from the body, typically a few bones or teeth. Often, a vegepygmy uses such bones to craft a crude spear or some other weapon.",
			"",
			"Vegepygmy tribes live in tightly knit communities and fiercely guard their patches of russet mold. Vegepygmies cannot speak-they communicate via a crude language of rhythmic taps, beats, and clicks. Hunting parties echo these exchanges through the caves they travel. Vegepygmies stand 2 to 4 feet tall and weigh between 15 to 45 pounds.",
			"",
			"Approximately 1 in 20 vegepymies are chieftains. A vegepygmy chieftain is an advanced vegepygmy (often one with class levels) that carries an infestation of russet mold spores in its flesh. A vegepygmy chieftain infects any creature it hits with its natural weapons with russet mold spores (see below).",
			"",
			"### Russet Mold (CR 6)",
			"",
			"This hazardous fungus can be found in dark, wet areas, and often grows in great abundance at the heart of a vegepygmy lair. When a creature approaches within 5 feet of a patch of russet mold, the fungus releases a cloud of spores in a 5-foot radius burst. Everyone in the area must make a DC 15 Fortitude save or the spores quickly take root in their victims, inflicting 2 points of Constitution damage per round. A new Fortitude save can be attempted each round to halt the growth. Although immunity to disease won't protect against russet mold spores, the growth can be halted by remove disease and similar effects. Exposure to sunlight also halts the spores' growth. Plants are immune to russet mold spores.",
			"",
			"After 24 hours, a fully grown vegepygmy bursts from the body of any creature slain by russet mold, provided the creature was Small or larger. For each size category larger than Small, the body produces one additional vegepygmy.",
			"",
			"A patch of russet mold is unharmed by all effects save for acid, alcohol, or remove disease (or a similar magical effect, such as heal), all of which can kill a single patch of russet mold on contact. Sunlight doesn't kill the mold, but does render it dormant and harmless as long as the sunlight persists.",
			"",
			"### Russet Mold Variants",
			"",
			"**Source** [Darklands Revisited pg. 61](source/darklands_revisited) Vegepygmies would not exist if not for the russet mold that facilitates their horrific means of reproduction. A typical patch of this rust-colored fungus covers a roughly 5-foot-square area, releasing its spores against living creatures that come within 5 feet of it. As the spores are not a disease effect, protection like a paladin's divine health is ineffective, but the growth of the spores can be halted with a remove disease spell or similar effect. The best tool to overcome the spores of a russet mold patch is exposure to sunlight, which kills both the spores and the mold itself.",
			"",
			"In addition to the standard russet mold, several other varieties of russet mold exist, each with unique properties and passing on racial variations to the vegepygmies they spawn.",
			"",
			"**Argent Mold (CR 8):** A far more insidious type of infection, argent mold is a reflective, gray-hued fungus. Creatures that come within 15 feet of argent mold must succeed at a DC 18 Fortitude saving throw or be infected by the mold's spores. Twenty-four hours after initial infection, the mold takes root and begins dealing 2 points of Constitution damage per round; success at a new Fortitude save halts the effect. All vegepygmies spawned from a character slain by this infection possess the [advanced creature simple template](template/advanced).",
			"",
			"**Aurus Mold (CR 5):** Aurus mold is a golden-tinged fungal matter that can sometimes be found on the surface. This variant mold is unaffected by sunlight, but its spores deal only 1 point of Constitution damage per round. There is a 50% chance that any vegepygmies created by this mold gain the [degenerate creature simple template](template/degenerate).",
			"",
			"**Iron Mold (CR 6):** This rare variant of russet mold is susceptible to cold damage instead of acid. Vegepygmies created by this variant mold gain immunity to acid and cold, but also gain light sensitivity."

Creatures caught in this area that are Large or smaller must succeed at a DC 18 Reflex saving throw or be pulled into the veldenar's space, potentially provoking attacks of opportunity.

Unless consumed during the creature's vacuum attack (in which case the viscous air immediately dissipates), the viscous air remains for 10 rounds before dissipating.

They typically feed on gaseous creatures-especially belkers and mihstus-though veldenars attack most anything that gets too close.",
			"",
			"Veldenars hide invisibly in areas that are abundant with prey. When a meal gets close enough, the veldenar unleashes its cloud of viscous air, then opens its mouth. The sudden change in pressure draws the prey into its gullet to be digested. While veldenars are more than capable of eating humanoid creatures-and often do when such beings enter their hunting grounds-they favor gigantic insects and beings of elemental fire.",

Attempting to control a vescavor swarm is a standard action, and the swarm can attempt to resist this attempt with a DC 17 Will save. If the swarm fails this save, the vescavor queen can issue a simple mental command as a swift action, such as \"fight,\" \"come here,\" \"go there,\" or \"stay still.\" Vescavor swarms affected by this ability act normally unless a vescavor queen is actively controlling them, but never attack the vescavor queen. The save DC is Charisma-based. In addition, whether or not it controls the swarm, a vescavor queen is immune to a vescavor swarm's swarm attacks and supernatural special abilities. A vescavor queen can release a vescavor swarm from its control as a free action. If a vescavor queen is killed, any vescavor swarms under its control disperse.",

			"Appearing as an amalgam of twisted, unnatural insects, a vescavor queen is a hideous sight to behold, even among the terrifying denizens of the Abyss. Not only is a queen's bite stronger than that of its spawn, but the queen can also spit acid at opponents, and its arms end in scything claws poised to rend through flesh and armor. Vescavor swarms instinctively obey a queen, eagerly seeking out those foes marked by the queen's attacks. A vescavor queen measures roughly 10 feet from head to tail, and weighs nearly 500 pound-more when carrying a brood."

Ruled by enormous, hideous queens who direct their swarms in finding food and destroying foes with the help of pheromones and mental commands, vescavor swarms devour objects, creatures, and structures alike. Their hunger is insatiable and carries with it the terrors of the Abyss itself, warping the minds of even those creatures who escape the vescavors' maws. Only adamantine can endure their gnashing teeth, and a swarm of vescavors that descends upon a settlement devours everything and leaves nothing behind."

They can also walk in humanoid guise when they wish, often assassinating victims of rank and assuming their victims' places. They have an unusual affection for their swords, often granting them threatening names.",
			"",
			"Vilderavns are drawn to war and suffering, often haunting battlefields-especially during protracted sieges. They are particularly drawn toward rulers and commanders, and might insinuate themselves into the confidence of leaders with their clever tongues and deft rumor-mongering. They are deceivers and heralds of woe, seeking to lure the rulers of mortal kingdoms into jealous feuds and fruitless wars with one another. To do this, they often cultivate reputations as master duelists, brilliant mercenary leaders, or unjustly banished nobility from distant lands. Regardless of their guises, vilderavns' advice usually seems wise and perceptive, steeped in an expansive knowledge of history, political rivalries, and cultural clashes, along with insights into the ways of war. Yet while their counsel might lead to early victories, their ultimate purpose is to bring doom to all sides. At the height of the battle, when victory seems nigh, a vilderavn often instigates a wave of betrayal, crippling erstwhile allies and bringing devastation. Only when a ruler's kingdom or a commander's army lies in ruins does a vilderavn administer the coup de grace.",
			"",
			"It is said that the first vilderavns were created by a vicious fey lord as a check and counter to the hubris of mortal rulers, especially those who put their trust in armies and steel to drive back the wild lands. The boasting and braggadocio of those mortals who believed they had achieved mastery over the followers of the old ways offended the fey lord, who sent vilderavns to infiltrate their ranks. The vilderavns watched from the shadows and learned the ways of mortals, the better to use their own weapons and strategies against them. In torment and blood, they peeled away the secrets of mortals, laying the last truths of their hearts bare before bestowing the gift of death on them. Even in death, however, a vilderavn's victims languish, stretched across the threshold of the afterlife yet tethered to the fey spirit's merciless heart. Their minds are open books for this fey to unravel and use in cruel and hurtful ways.",
			"",
			"Vilderavns sometimes amuse themselves by offering false oracular advice or tempting bargains to mortals, promising power in exchange for the blood of innocents. A vilderavn typically claims to be cursed into its animal form, insisting that only innocent blood will release it. If its mark is foolish enough to accept its bargain, the vilderavn often returns wearing the innocent's flesh to torment its supposed ally and drive her to insanity. A vilderavn might even offer an irony-laced limited wish to sweeten its bargains and truly test a mortal's resolve."

			"**Rejuvenation (Su)** A vilkacis that is destroyed in combat restores itself after 2d4 days.

Specters of savagery escaped from remains tainted by lycanthropy, vilkacis desire to wear mortal flesh and again revel in the vicious ecstasy of hunting and killing. Some see these beings as malign manifestations of the lycanthropic curse-the spirits of the infamous affliction itself-while others know them as the deathly continuance of lives consumed by lycanthropy. In either case, these ravenous spirit-beasts seek only to garb themselves in the skins of deadly hunters and revel in bloodshed once more.",

To do this, a spellcaster must prepare a canopic stone, a talisman that typically takes the form of a ceramic totem or amulet bound in silver. Upon creating this object, the bearer can summon a vilkacis once per day. The stone grants no control over the vilkacis, but the creature will not attack or attempt to possess the stone's bearer. Upon being summoned, the vilkacis turns its attention to the nearest creature other than the summoner, attempting to possess the creature's body and go on a murderous rampage. Using a canopic stone to summon a vilkacis is considered an evil act.",

While stories speaking of the plant's ability to lure prey into its clutches by virtue of its swaying motion persist, this effect is in fact created by this invisible, odorless pollen cloud.",
			"",
			"Since viper vines gain nourishment through the consumption of creatures rather than through moisture and soil, they have developed rudimentary locomotion and are able to drag themselves along the ground with their tentacle-like root system. They even possess a form of rudimentary sentience, allowing them to not only discern differences in prey and make limited tactical decisions, but also to avoid creatures that are particularly large or dangerous looking. The area around the hunting grounds of these predators is often strewn with the remains of victims, and it is not unusual to find the rotting corpses of wild animals, ill-fated adventurers, and even giants in their immediate vicinity, along with a scattering of incidental treasure left behind by the plant's victims."

This is a teleportation effect. The vishap can sense the exact shape and length of the ley line, and knows exactly where each vishapakar along the ley line is. In addition, the vishap automatically knows the status (as per the spell) of each living creature along the ley line's path or attuned to the ley line.

By concentrating as a standard action, a vishap can view the surroundings of a vishapakar on one of its attuned ley lines as per greater scrying.",
			"",
			"#### Description",
			"",
			"Vishaps think of themselves as guardians of the ley lines that connect the life forces of the Material Plane to one another. Like all dragons, vishaps claim expansive territories, but these territories often make little geographical sense to others-a single vishap might claim unconnected areas on different hemispheres of a planet, for example, and yet multiple vishaps sometimes coexist within mere miles of each other with no apparent animosity. To those attuned to the occult mysteries of ley lines, however, the vishaps' territorial borders are clear. Each vishap claims one or more networks of ley lines, which may stretch for thousands of miles (or even across galaxies), and sometimes overlap with each other without ever touching. A vishap's first priority is the integrity of its ley line network, so any corruption of a ley line draws the attention of the vishap that cares for it.",
			"",
			"Vishaps claim only small physical territories in places where their ley lines coincide with interesting geography. In these places, vishaps make psychic contact with intelligent creatures nearby, encouraging them to create standing stones called vishapakars. A vishap can't place a vishapakar on its own, but the presence of a vishapakar on a ley line allows the vishap a great deal of control over that ley line. Evil or less diplomatic vishaps often travel to these desirable locations to intimidate the local people into appeasing the dragons with standing stones. Vishapakars can stand for thousands of years, even as the ley lines that they once marked drift and change course, so a vishap must return to each vishapakar periodically, entreating (or forcing) locals to create new vishapakars on the ley lines' new locations. At particularly ancient locations, it is possible to map the gradual drift of ley lines by the age of the nearby vishapakars.",
			"",
			"Vishaps become deeply attached to their ley line networks over their millennia-long life spans, and can live peacefully alongside other vishaps with nearby networks. When ley lines drift and converge, however, it often results in a mortal duel. Sometimes this happens as a corporeal battle in the skies of a planet, or between the dragons while in their ethereal forms. Most commonly, vishaps engaged in mortal combat for control of converging ley lines meet each other in elaborate psychic duels. These duels can last for years, and often spill over into the Material Plane, with each vishap subtly manipulating the creatures and locations along the converging ley lines in a proxy war to defeat its opponent.",
			"",
			"Vishaps keep their treasure hoards, like their territories, in strange places, hidden in eddies of psychic energy along their favorite ley lines. A vishap's hoard might be physically scattered across dozens of planes, though to the vishap each cache is only minutes away from the others. A vishap favors items of psychic significance, so one is as likely to find a mundane wooden spoon that belonged to a powerful occultist or the skull of a famous psychic in a vishap's hoard as a magical sword or mountains of gold.",
			"",
			"Vishaps procreate only once during their lives, as tending to their ley lines takes priority over almost any biological imperative. When a vishap is finally ready to mate, it commits its form wholly to the ley line network, drifting listlessly along the psychic currents. Inevitably, it meets with some other drifting vishap, and the two consciousnesses merge, exploding in a spray of psychic force. The resulting motes of ethereal energy scatter across the universe, slowly drifting back toward each other and forming eggs, which sometimes drift along ley lines for millennia before hatching a young, ethereal vishap that awakens to full consciousness upon hatching.",

A vodyanoi can control narrow currents of breathable water to provide oxygen to up to 3 other creatures in the area of effect-vodyanois themselves are immune to this effect. All other creatures in an area of suffocating water must hold their breath or risk suffocation. Once created, an area of suffocating water does not move-it persists for a number of minutes equal to the vodyanoi's Hit Dice.

Their hatred of boggards is another sure way to arouse their anger-a vodyanoi who suspects one of boggard collusion will often attack on sight. Those who live in close proximity to vodyanoi tribes learn quickly to leave the folk alone, and when visits or intrusions into vodyanoi lands are necessary (such as when one might need to seek out a vodyanoi for aid in curing a disease), gifts of magic potions and exotic fruits are highly recommended."

One voidstick is required for every Hit Die possessed by the base creature.

Packed with the bitter entropy of negative energy, the creature rises, seeking out the life force of others with endless sadness and insane determination. Its single goal is to extinguish life and smother any source of positive energy. Multiple voidsticks in a creature's form feed one another, augmenting their standard abilities and imbuing the touch of the voidstick zombie with the power to drain life from anything it touches. The zombie becomes almost a sliver of the void itself, existing in a state of such negative power that its very proximity can tamper with other creatures' abilities to summon the powers of the Positive Energy Plane, and with the perpetual sadness that numbs its own intellect it gains the power to enhance and influence other creatures that depend on negative energy.",
			"",
			"These sad creatures, wracked with soulless negative energy, constantly hunger for destruction, delighted at every chance they get to snuff the spark of life from the living. They hunt the islands throughout the Shackles, especially the Cannibal Isles, where their creation began long before its current inhabitants made their home there.",
			"",
			"As the brutal and savage kuru people of the Cannibal Isles explored the ruins of Ghol-Gan, they discovered the foul magic involved with the voidsticks, and as they turned to barbarism and cannibalism, their shamans carved these devices and created the first voidstick zombie seen on Golarion in thousands of years. The kuru use voidstick zombies for war against each other and to serve as ruthless hunters, culling humanoids who wander too close to their blood-drenched islands. Kuru shamans create the vile voidsticks in order to enhance their own necromantic strength as well as to animate voidstick zombies. In some tribes it is seen as a great honor to be transformed into one of these powerful creatures, and some aged shamans on the eve of their death elect to undergo this transformation instead of becoming a ritual meal for their tribes.",
			"",
			"Since the rediscovery of voidsticks, those interested in necromancy and the creation of new undead have sent emissaries to the Shackles eager to buy them. These enterprising necromancers experiment with the devices and unleash voidstick zombies into Avistan and Garund to fulfill their murderous intent.",

			"In remote parts of the world, it is not always practical for the faithful to visit holy places with any regularity. In particular, the weak, the sick, and the dying may be in no position to trek across plains or risk dangerous water crossings to see their spiritual leaders. In response to this, the godstick was born-a crafted rod that serves as a portable shrine, carried by shamans and witchdoctors and pushed into the ground to focus devotion at any location. Ingenuity is not just the way of the benign, however, and just as often it is the way of evil. Before long, shamans who worshiped more hateful deities corrupted this notion; they created the [voidsticks](magic-wondrous/voidstick) and drove them into bodies, living or dead, charging those bodies with the power of the endless void and creating rattling, hungry abominations."

While the vooniths are native to the strange Dimension of Dream, many have found their way out of that realm and into the waking world to take up lairs in the swampy fens and remote coastlines of the world. How the vooniths originally managed to make this transition between worlds is unclear.",

While certainly not as sharp as the average human, a voonith is smart enough to know how to speak and often does so with others of its kind. Vooniths do not often choose to communicate with other creatures, giving rise to the misconception that they're little more than dumb animals, but on occasion, travelers in swampy regions tell tales of overhearing strange piping voices speaking among the reeds. Those few who know the secrets of the Aklo tongue can understand these words, although understanding of what the vooniths whisper in the night when they think no one else can hear is not always for the best.",
			"",
			"While not evil, vooniths have a decidedly dark sense of humor, and take great pleasure in concocting violent poems or grisly jokes. Punch lines in which non-voonith creatures-particularly humans, cats, and gnomes-meet gory and ironic fates are the most entertaining to vooniths. Some tales speak of canny travelers who, with the ability to speak Aklo, manage to strike up unlikely conversations with lurking vooniths. In truth, vooniths are quite social, and when one breeches the awkwardness arising from interspecies conflict, a friendship with a voonith can be an unexpected reward. Vooniths who befriend travelers often escort them, quietly and unseen, through dangerous bogs, and when such travelers fall prey to other dangers of the swamp, a friendly voonith will provide what aid it can.",

Even so, vorvoraks present a danger to those who intrude upon their claimed territories.",
			"",
			"A vorvorak's body is roughly the shape of a dragon, while its head is that of a crocodile. What can appear at first to be wings on its back are in fact a pair of hard fins. A vorvorak's scales are usually muddy brown in color, occasionally accented with moss-green spots or stripes.",
			"",
			"An average vorvorak is 24 feet long from nose to tail and weighs around 3,000 pounds.",
			"",
			"The systematic extermination of nearly all of Taldor's drakes and dragons following the years of brutal draconic attacks known as the Dragon Plague left a gap in the region's ecosystem; in the roughly thousand years since, vorvoraks have evolved to fill that niche. Though vorvoraks descended from crocodiles native to the region, magical contamination has both accelerated the species' development and granted its members uncanny abilities. At the height of the Taldan Empire, magic was used both to beautify canals and to control and protect the water within them. Sages speculate that when remote canals were later abandoned, decaying magic leached into the water, where it was absorbed by the vorvoraks' predecessors. After many generations of exposure, the theory goes, vorvoraks developed magical powers-and the intelligence to control them.",
			"",
			"A vorvorak has many superficial features of a crocodile, but also has a thick serpentine neck and elongated limbs that end in prehensile claws. Two fins extend from its back; though easily mistaken for wings at a distance, these are in fact enlarged scutes (akin to the bony upper scales of crocodiles). The purpose of these fins is unclear, but they may have evolved as armor or to regulate heat. The vorvorak's dull brown coloring allows the creature to better hide in its preferred habitat and ambush prey. Patches of green sometimes add to its disguise. Each vorvorak's unique pattern helps differentiate individuals.",
			"",
			"Vorvoraks exert power over the water around them, allowing them to raise or lower its level, produce mist, and, most impressively, eject large quantities of water mixed with their own poisonous bile. Vorvoraks also seem to demonstrate mastery of multiple manifestations of magic-such as altering matter, summoning creatures, and creating explosions of energy-but these abilities are mere illusions, containing the barest shadow of reality. Vorvoraks use their magic to attract prey, conceal their lairs, and deter trespassers in their territory. Though these shadowy illusions have a chance of damaging opponents in combat, they more often serve as distractions that allow vorvoraks to position themselves for full attacks.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"Vorvoraks are solitary hunters, most active at dawn and dusk. Though generally associated with Taldor's disused canal system, a few make their lairs in natural gullies. A natural or burrowed niche provides the beasts a place to sleep and store treasure. Often the entrances to vorvoraks' lairs are partially submerged; otherwise, a vorvorak hides the entrance with an illusion when it leaves to hunt. Vorvoraks feed mostly on creatures that live in or near canals, as well as the occasional domestic animal that wanders into their range. Its few sentient victims tend to be unlucky lost travelers who attempt to follow the old canals back to civilization.",
			"",
			"Like dragons, vorvoraks line their lairs with treasures. In addition to coins and jewels taken from humanoid victims, vorvorak hoards are likely to contain common artifacts of imperial Taldor. These treasures may come from nearby ruins of abandoned estates, but just as often the beasts find them buried in the sediment at the bottom of a canal. Vorvoraks keep even broken or tarnished treasures, using illusions to make these items appear new.",
			"",
			"When vorvoraks meet, it's usually to fight over territory. The only time the creatures seek each other out is when driven to mate, which occurs only once or twice per decade, usually after a particularly heavy rain. The pair stays together only long enough to conceive, after which the female lays her eggs in the deepest water in her territory. Young vorvoraks that survive their first 2 or 3 years are \"encouraged\" to find their own territory as soon as their mother's hunger or jealousy overcomes her maternal instincts.",
			"",
			"Though they avoid active waterways, vorvoraks occasionally clash with humanoids. This usually occurs when a young vorvorak seeking territory moves too close to a civilized area or when enterprising Taldans attempt to reclaim lands around abandoned canals. In the centuries since the Dragon Plague, few Taldans have seen a true dragon, and they could easily mistake a vorvorak for one. Would-be dragon slayers, seeking to emulate the heroes of old, hunt vorvoraks for glory and treasure. A common (and likely apocryphal) story tells of simple villagers who mistook a vorvorak for a spawn of the Tarrasque-until a traveling priest subdued the monster and led it into the town square. Ashamed of their terrible judgment and cowardice, the villagers soon converted to the priest's religion (which varies according to the story's teller)."

			"",
			"A vouivre is a deceptive and monstrous predator that looks like a humanoid woman from the waist up and the front end of a green-scaled dragon from the waist down. It shuns the company of its own kind, preferring evil fey (particularly water-dwelling ones such as nixies) for intelligent conversation and mundane snakes for companionship. A vouivre is 12 feet long from head to head, weighs 500 pounds, and can live 200 years.",
			"",
			"Vouivres make their homes in small caves near calm waters. They like to decorate their lairs with shiny coins, jewelry, and bright silks. One might place some of its treasure in the water outside to lure in curious humanoids, and bathe in these waters as a further enticement, hiding its reptilian half until prey is within striking distance. Because a vouivre can breathe water or air (from either head), it often grabs a creature, then retreats underwater to wait for the opponent to drown. It prefers humanoid flesh, but will feed on any available warm-blooded prey. Vouivres have an affinity for music, and their magic is often accompanied by singing or subtle musical vibrations from their scales.",
			"",
			"When a vouivre dies, its dragon head disgorges a 2-foot-diameter glassy egg. After around 6 weeks, the egg hatches into one or two vouivres, which take 7 years to reach maturity. These offspring resemble humanoids the mother has eaten, so it prefers to feast on attractive and strong victims. The young also adapt to the appearance of nearby reptilian creatures."

Vukodlaks possess monstrous strength, making them ideal mounts for powerful undead masters or other evil creatures. While serving as mounts, they keep to all fours, and might easily be mistaken for worgs or great fanged horses.

Vukodlaks share a natural kinship with vampires and often serve them willingly.",

Riders who are not careful in their attempts to restrain a hungry vukodlak risk having their mount turn on them. While vukodlaks can go days without feeding, they gradually become weaker if they do not feed daily, and have difficulty operating on anything other than pure instinct. Though intelligent, vukodlaks rarely think or plan ahead, instead focusing on feeding or obeying their masters' commands.",
			"",
			"Vukodlaks without masters often form small packs. These packs annihilate all life in entire areas, overfeeding until destroyed or forced to move on. Vukodlaks hate sunlight and hunt only at night, making their lairs in deep caves or ruins.

While these majestic beasts are rarely encountered by humans, tales around the fires of fish camps and within the relative safety of riverside taverns claim that, when riled, a wakandagi will come screaming out from within a veil of clinging mist, scattering foes, capsizing boats, and spitting its water bombs, which can render a foe unconscious. Any creature straying too close to the beast falls victim to its branching antlers.",
			"",
			"The other, less destructive tales involving wakandagis portray them as considerate and kind-hearted beasts, sometimes flooding a burning field to save a crop of corn, pushing a sinking boat to shore to save the crew, or even saving a child bitten by a viper while playing in the river.",
			"",
			"A wakandagi stands 9 feet at the shoulder, stretches 18 feet from nose to tail, and weighs 2,200 pounds."

			"**Isolated Restoration (Su)** A walcofinde in a sealed chamber, such as one closed with locked doors and windows, regains 1 hit point every hour. If the chamber is fully enclosed, with no intentional methods of exit, the walcofinde instead regains 3 hit points every hour.",
			"",
			"**Structural Possession (Su)** As a full-round action, a walcofinde adjacent to a wall in a sealed chamber can merge part of itself with that wall. For as long as it maintains physical contact with a portion of the wall, the walcofinde can manifest through any part of that wall within 100 feet, including the opposite side of the wall. A walcofinde's manifestation occupies the same space as a 5-foot-long portion of the wall, appearing as if its torso were emerging from the wall but with the texture of the wall (such as wood or stone) instead of its normal decayed flesh. It cannot manifest from broken areas of a wall, nor can this manifestation separate from the wall at any time. The walcofinde can perceive creatures with all of its senses through this manifestation, and the manifestation can make claw attacks against creatures within 10 feet of the portion of wall from which it is manifested. As a move action that provokes attacks of opportunity, the manifestation can reposition itself along this wall at a maximum speed of 15 feet per round. The manifestation can be attacked as though such attacks targeted the walcofinde, but it gains a +2 bonus to its AC due to partial cover from the wall it occupies. While using this ability, the walcofinde is helpless. It can cease its manifestation as a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity from creatures threatening either the manifestation or the walcofinde. If a walcofinde using this ability is moved 10 or more feet away from the wall it has merged with, it takes 1d8 points of damage and its manifestation immediately disappears. If the walcofinde is killed, its manifested body is immediately reabsorbed into the possessed wall.",
			"",
			"#### Description",
			"",
			"Similar to the undead monstrosities known as [immured](monster/immured), walcofindes are pitiful undead creatures that manifest when a living being is sealed within a structure and perishes there. These unquiet dead often rise after having been intentionally walled into a structure. This process is what many have attributed its name to, with some treatises on undead referring to them as \"wall-coffined.\" While both walcofindes and immured form from humanoids who were either sealed within a wall or victims of a collapse, their divergent abilities have led scholars of the undead to posit why the differences manifested as they have. Immured have the ability to displace life-giving oxygen, suggesting they perished through suffocation while trapped. Walcofindes, instead, ultimately succumbed to death by starvation while trapped. These latter transformed undead resemble the decayed appearance of zombies, albeit with vicious bony claws-the result of desperate escape attempts prior to the starvation that ultimately sealed their demise. It is rare for other creatures to ever see a walcofinde's true appearance, as these undead most often harry the living by possessing nearby walls.",
			"",
			"### Ecology",
			"",
			"Most adventurers stumble upon a walcofinde as it manifests from nearby walls, using its structural possession ability to move beyond its sealed chamber and unleash its rage against creatures traversing halls or caverns it possesses. In this manifested form, the walcofinde takes on the texture of the structure it possesses, appearing with the shape it had in life but made from stone, wood, or whatever substance makes up the wall from which it emerges.",
			"",
			"A walcofinde's structural possession ability is its primary means of movement and interaction with the outside world. The walcofinde positions itself adjacent to a wall within its chamber and then touches the wall with both claws, entering a trance wherein it possesses and manifests along the wall. Prior to its death, a creature destined to become a walcofinde often succumbs to the basest, most desperate attempts to escape its imprisonment. Desperately clawing at walls reduces the creature's fingers to ragged stumps of jagged and sharpened bone. To assist in its murderous capabilities, a walcofinde possessing a structure can elongate its vicious clawed arms while manifesting from a wall to strike foes who might have thought themselves safe.",
			"",
			"Those startled by the sudden appearance of a walcofinde often believe the undead has the same structural makeup as the wall it emerges from, but the walcofinde receives only minor protection from the nearby terrain, and its manifested form is almost as vulnerable as its true body. In fact, defeating a walcofinde's manifested form also destroys the undead. Because of this, a walcofinde often retreats from combat, rather than risk destruction. The fact that a walcofinde exhibits supernaturally expedited healing while within sealed chambers likewise encourages a hit-and-run style of punishing intruders.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"For a walcofinde to rise, a living creature must die while trapped in a walled-in chamber. Sometimes this can be as mundane as a group of miners trapped in a collapse. In some cultures, immurement is a sign of favor, and rising as a walcofinde is considered a gift from the heavens that enables the creature to continue defending a site in death. Most often, though, this grisly event occurs during a construction project where secrecy is paramount and workers involved with important portions of the construction are intentionally trapped within the edifice. The often-flawed logic behind this method of murder is to prevent the bodies from ever being exhumed and interrogated.",
			"",
			"Due to its relatively intact intelligence, a walcofinde can understand enemy tactics and even recognize different threats based on its observations over time. Many walcofindes are cunning enough to assess the appearance and equipment of their foes, allowing them to prioritize targets. As with most undead, a walcofinde endeavors to slay divine spellcasters as quickly as possible. Because of the effort required to cease manifesting, a walcofinde knows that it is particularly vulnerable to channeled positive energy, so it often hides in order to surprise intruders in an opening assault before foes with such abilities can act.",
			"",
			"Humans are the most populous progenitor species for walcofindes, simply a result of humanity's high population. After humans, dwarves and halflings are the most frequently encountered varieties of walcofindes. Old dwarven rituals, such as the Droskar-demanded rites common during Ordrik Talhrik's reign of the Five Kings Mountains, required fortresses to be regularly fortified by walcofindes at regular intervals-hundreds died to fuel these depraved rituals. Conversely, halfling variants (walcofindes with the young creature simple template) are found in the ruins of many Inner Sea empires, having died while serving as slave labor in construction efforts."
