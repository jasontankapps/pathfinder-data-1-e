They enter the physical world on their own in pursuit of those who have trodden too much the netherways beyond time and reality-time travelers (be it physical travel or simply divinatory glimpses forward or backward in time) and creatures that teleport without regard to how this movement impacts subtle magical currents in the multiverse particularly draw their interest."

The evolution of the pseudodragon into the house drake took only a few generations, quickly enough that many scholars suspect the outside influence of a mysterious patron of some supernatural source.",

			"Huecuvas are the risen corpses of heretical clerics who blasphemed and renounced their deities before meeting death. In unlife, they hate and seek to destroy those pious souls who keep their vows. Although easily mistaken for zombies or even skeletons, huecuvas have a spark of intelligence that makes them cunning and deceptive foes. During daylight hours, a huecuva becomes shrouded in an illusion that causes it to appear as it did in life-at these times, a huecuva might seek to infiltrate society to dwell among those it hates. When night falls, it emerges to seek out its prey. Fortunately for the living, the typical huecuva has only fragments of intellect remaining, so it is usually not long before the undead creature makes an error of judgment or simply reveals itself for the monster it is.",
			"",
			"Most huecuvas remember little of their former lives except for the blasphemies that led them to their cursed fates. They often find themselves drawn to the ruins of old temples, where they rage against or seek hopeless absolution from the deities who so afflicted them. Huecuvas sometimes work in concert with other undead creatures that share the same area.",
			"",
			"While most huecuvas arise when a god rejects a heretic priest's soul, forcing the slain to rise as horrible undead, a huecuva can also be created with create undead. The caster must be at least 11th level, and the body to be transformed must have been an evil cleric in life. The spell can be used to create a huecuva using the body of a nonevil cleric, but doing so requires a DC 20 caster level check."

			"",
			"From the front, a huldra appears to be a beautiful human woman, yet two distinctive features mark the huldra as something supernatural: her long, foxlike tail, and the fact that she doesn't have a solid back-merely a hole that reveals her body to be a hollow, bark-lined shell. Most huldras wear their hair long to mask the hole in their backs, and they prefer long gowns to hide their tails when interacting with humanoids. Though huldras are not ashamed of their status as fey, they react rather negatively when someone points out their tails. So long as humanoids are respectful, however, huldras tend to be curious about other races, and may aid those who pass through their territories by telling them the best places for hunting or fishing.",
			"",
			"Huldras sometimes become enamored of woodcutters or others who adventure outdoors, and invite these paramours to share their beds, but such romances usually end in disappointment and misunderstanding on both sides. Despite their relatively lithe frames, huldras are deceptively strong, and stories abound of them performing astonishing feats of strength such as straightening horseshoes and tossing aside attackers, and their natural weapons are quite potent."

A hundun is immune to mind-affecting effects, and any creature that attempts to affect a hundun with a mind-affecting effect gains 1d4 temporary negative levels (Will DC 31 negates) from entropic feedback.

			"",
			"**Faceless (Ex)** A hundun has no eyes, but detects infinitesimal gravitic distortions through its skin, gaining blindsense 300 feet. A hundun is blind and deaf, and is immune to effects that depend on sight or hearing. It subsists on negative energy and doesn't breathe, eat, or drink.",
			"",
			"**Spacetime Shifting (Ex)** Reality constantly reconfigures in the vicinity of a hundun, correcting the paradoxes the creature's existence in space and time generates. This causes all attacks against the hundun to suffer a 20% miss chance, and grants the hundun a deflection bonus to AC and a racial bonus on Reflex saves equal to its Charisma modifier.",
			"",
			"**Strange Attractor (Sp)** A hundun can activate or deactivate the stafflike strange attractor it carries as a free action. While active, a strange attractor hovers in place, and the hundun can mentally move it up to 60 feet through space as a move action, to a maximum range of 300 feet. If it enters a space with a creature, it stops moving for the round and that creature must attempt a DC 31 Will saving throw. The creature falls unconscious for 1 round if it fails this save, or is nauseated for 1 round if it succeeds. The space around an active strange attractor twists and warps, trapping creatures within its gravity well. This functions like repulsion but in reverse: creatures within 60 feet attempting to move away from it are prevented from doing so, wasting their move actions (Reflex DC 31 negates). Lawful creatures beginning their turn within 60 feet of an active strange attractor are nauseated for 1 round (Will DC 31 negates). Nausea caused by a strange attractor is a mind-affecting effect. Creatures with the chaotic subtype are immune to all effects of the strange attractor. The save DCs are Charisma-based. ",
			"",
			"A strange attractor can't be attacked or harmed by physical attacks, but disintegrate, mage's disjunction, a sphere of annihilation, or a rod of cancellation affect it. A strange attractor's touch AC is 18 (+8 deflection), and attacks against it suffer a 20% miss chance. If a hundun's strange attractor is destroyed, the hundun can create a new one after 1d8 hours of uninterrupted meditation. If a hundun is slain, its strange attractor disappears.",
			"",
			"**Unarmed Strikes (Ex)** A hundun's unarmed strikes deal 4d8 points of damage, and function as chaotic, magic, and adamantine weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. A hundun can make a flurry of blows attack with its unarmed strikes as a 20th-level monk, without increasing its base attack bonus or taking the -2 penalty on attack rolls. This ability also grants the hundun the befuddling strike rogue talent and the punishing kick hungry ghost monk class feature.",

			"#### Description",

			"In the nightmare dimensions of unreality beyond space and time, the power of alien Gods is sufficient to give life to intention. Hunduns are the incarnation of the desire to reduce the multiverse to a space filled with nothing but randomly fluctuating energy fields and gravitic curvatures. Hunduns are primordial alien monks who embody aspects of the gaping, formless void that preceded the creation of the multiverse. They are out of step with reality, which accommodates their individual existences as intractable errors that must be continually accounted for yet that can never fully be corrected. These bizarre aberrations of life are sustained by negative energy-life's antithetical force-yet they are not undead, nor do they differentiate between the living and the unliving in the pursuit of their purpose. Few beings can exist on the Negative Energy Plane for long, making the hunduns, who often make their homes there, something of an anomaly. Some scholars speculate that early hunduns came to the Negative Energy Plane as explorers, and remained there, addicted to the mixture of pain and euphoric release caused by the effects of negative energy on their skin.",
			"",
			"Hunduns are tireless antagonists of archons, asuras, axiomites, devils, inevitables, kytons, and other exemplars of law. They oppose any effort to impose or maintain discipline, structure, or regulation. They loathe and undermine the prospect of peace or tranquility, and relish confusion, disorder, and destruction. Though these attitudes would seem to make them ideological allies of the proteans, hunduns hold those creatures in contempt, caring nothing for that race's strange religion, nor the spontaneous, ephemeral acts of creation in which proteans delight. Hunduns believe that the freedom and truth of pure entropy are preferable to the artificial illusions of structure, and they seek to spread this brand of enlightenment to others as part of their goal to free all creation from order's fetters.",
			"",
			"Hunduns appear as gigantic humanoids with faces hidden by voluminous, hooded robes made out of their own wrinkled skin. In truth, their faces are not hidden, for they are faceless; the interiors of their hoods are just filled with more folds of skin. They carry staff-like objects known as strange attractors, which appear as different things to different observers but always as something that causes some form of revulsion or nausea: a shaft of knotted intestines and vital organs, studded with colored, weeping eyes; a polished metallic rod on which distorted reflections of the observer indulge in extreme self-harm; a column of darkness in which worlds spiral toward a black heart that snuffs out the life on them. These implements are not artificial objects, but part of a hundun's body. As well as being weapons and snares, they are methods of reproduction. Two hunduns can bring their strange attractors together, causing them to merge into an egg-shaped object under the control of one of the parents; the other parent must create a new strange attractor. This ovoid is still a strange attractor in all respects save for its shape, but if it is moved, the development of the embryonic hundun within must begin anew. The gestation of the new hundun takes many years. When the egg hatches, the strange attractor is destroyed and a fully formed hundun emerges. Reproduction between hunduns doesn't involve any sort of love or even affection. Rather, the two hunduns feel a premonition that another hundun will be needed to fight order in the future, then meet and breed wordlessly.",
			"",
			"Hunduns can be found floating in the Negative Energy Plane or within stable voids in the planes of chaos, meditating on ways to corrupt universal truths and undermine the laws of nature on a cosmic scale-anything they can exploit to trigger the collapse and implosion of entire dimensions or planes of existence. Though they spend the majority of their time in solitary contemplation or action, hunduns sometimes gather to oppose forms of creation or manifestations of law that require greater numbers to counteract. The creatures come together spontaneously, drawn by an innate sensitivity to the structuring forces that operate on reality.",
			"",
			"Hunduns stand around 10 feet tall, yet weigh only about 700 pounds. Sustained entirely by negative energy, hunduns never eat or rest and are immune to aging; they are effectively immortal and die only through violence."

This is a mind-affecting fear effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.",
			"",
			"**Enveloping Mists (Ex)** A hungry fog can [engulf](umr/engulf) foes. A creature engulfed by a hungry fog does not gain the pinned condition and may move normally-such a creature is not in danger of suffocating, but as long as it begins its turn engulfed, it is staggered in addition to the damage the attack causes. The save DC to avoid the enveloping mists is Constitution-based.",
			"",
			"**Gaseous (Ex)** A hungry fog has a body composed of eerie mist. It can pass through small holes or narrow openings, even mere cracks, but cannot enter water or other liquid. It has no Strength score, and cannot manipulate objects as a result.",
			"",

			"#### Description",
			"",
			"This eerie, vaporous ooze slips silently through the air, a roiling cloud of green fog within which dance the indistinct shapes of twisted, spooky ghosts. Despite its haunting appearance, and despite the fact that hungry fogs often dwell in old graveyards or hunt battlefields, a hungry fog is not an undead creature. Rather, it is a form of gaseous ooze infused with negative energy. Thus, while a hungry fog is not an undead creature, undead gain considerable boons by fighting within a hungry fog, for its mists heal them as surely as they drain vitality from the living creatures caught within.",
			"",
			"Within a hungry fog, the ooze's mists interact strangely with fragments of those it has consumed, creating eerie phantasms of its past victims. Periodically, one of these shapes might flash with light as if momentarily holding a lantern aloft, but as soon as the figure is approached, it fades away into the surrounding mists, often giving the observer a quick and unsettling glimpse of a skull-like countenance. These shapes, like the fog itself, are not truly undead, but the fact that a hungry fog is hurt by positive energy as surely as if it were helps to blur the distinction and spread even more confusion about its actual nature.",
			"",
			"A hungry fog is instinctively drawn to areas where negative energy is strong. These nocturnal creatures are particularly fond of sites that are haunted, such as old houses, abandoned graveyards, or shipwrecks along shorelines-although their vulnerability to high winds means that they are rarely encountered in areas where storms are common."

			"**Answer Beckoning (Ex)** Although a hunting horror is not an elemental or outsider, it can be conjured via gate, greater planar ally, or greater planar binding, provided the caster of the spell is a worshiper of one of the Great Old Ones or Outer Gods or specifically alters the words of the spell to invoke a hunting horror, and provided the spell is not cast in an area of direct sunlight. When invoking a hunting horror in this way, the spellcaster must succeed at a DC 30 Spellcraft check as part of the casting of the spell, or when the hunting horror arrives it is automatically free to act under its own will.",
			"",
			"**Contingency (Sp)** While the exact details of a particular hunting horror's contingency effect can vary wildly (as the monster has an immense range of potential spells to choose from due to its ability to manipulate magic), most settle for the simple but effective tactic of causing a greater invisibility spell to activate on the hunting horror as soon as it takes damage.",
			"",
			"**Crush (Ex)** A flying hunting horror can land on foes as a standard action, and then use its lengthy coils to crush them. This attack is effective only against creatures three or more size categories smaller than the hunting horror (Medium for most hunting horrors), and affects as many creatures as fit in the hunting horror's space. Any creature in the affected area must succeed at a DC 25 Reflex saving throw or be pinned, automatically taking 4d6+18 points of bludgeoning damage each round it is pinned. If the hunting horror chooses to maintain the pin, it must succeed at a combat maneuver check as normal. The save DC is Constitution-based.",
			"",
			"**Hunter (Ex)** Hunting horrors are efficient and talented at tracking prey, and Survival is a class skill for these creatures as a result. In addition, they gain a +8 racial bonus on Survival checks. When a hunting horror succeeds at a Survival check to follow a creature's tracks, the hunting horror can declare that creature to be its prey. If there are multiple sets of tracks from a group of creatures traveling together, the hunting horror can choose which specific creature becomes its prey if it knows the target is among those in the group; otherwise, its chosen prey is determined randomly. The next time the hunting horror begins a battle against its prey, it gains a +10 bonus on its initiative check. In addition, its prey takes a -2 penalty on all saving throws against the hunting horror's spell-like abilities. A hunting horror can have only one creature as its designated prey at any one time, and if 24 hours pass without the hunting horror succeeding at a Survival check to follow that prey's trail, that creature ceases being the hunting horror's prey.",
			"",
			"**Manipulate Magic (Sp)** A hunting horror is gifted at manipulating magic to affect a wide range of spell-like abilities beyond those that it normally can access. In effect, this allows each hunting horror to use limited wish three times per day as a spell-like ability, but only to duplicate a sorcerer/wizard spell of 6th level or lower. Hunting horrors typically use this ability to deal with foes who manage to stay at a distance, favoring potent attacks like chain lightning, disintegrate, and flesh to stone. Most save the third and final daily use for emergencies-teleport to escape from a battle gone unpredictably poorly, for example, or break enchantment or greater dispel magic to remove a debilitating effect. All hunting horrors use this ability to maintain a contingency effect on themselves as well.",

			"",
			"**Squeezing Coils (Ex)** A creature that takes damage from a hunting horror's constrict ability after being struck by the hunting horror's tail slap attack must succeed at a DC 29 Fortitude saving throw or fall unconscious for 1d4 rounds. The save DC is Strength-based.",
			"",
			"**Susceptible to Sunlight (Ex)** While the glow of a distant star does not inconvenience a hunting horror, this creature cannot abide the light of a sun in relatively close proximity-including sunlight on a typical habitable planet such as Golarion. When in natural sunlight (but not in an area of daylight or similar spells), a hunting horror can't attack and is staggered. In sunlight, its fast healing ability doesn't function, it loses its damage reduction, and it takes 2d6 points of fire damage per round. In areas of natural sunlight, a hunting horror's light sensitivity increases to light blindness.",

			"#### Description",

			"Servitors of the Crawling Chaos Nyarlathotep, the serpentine hunting horrors excel at tracking and seeking prey, talents that often see them called on by cultists or spellcasters to hunt down enemies. They speak in great and powerful voices, when they deign to speak at all.",
			"",
			"A typical hunting horror is 60 feet long but weighs only 2 tons.",
			"",
			"### Ecology",
			"",
			"A hunting horror abhors light, as it is a creature of inky blackness, some scholars theorize to be akin to the darkness that makes up the Dark Tapestry. Certainly these creatures seem uninterested in obeying the laws of physics in flight; their ability to fly is supernatural, rather than the result of physical exertion-some hunting horrors even have but a single wing that flops lazily as it slithers with great speed through the air. The material that composes their bodies is also supernatural, for although they burn like straw when exposed to sunlight, their hide is thick and difficult to damage with most weapons; only magical blades have a chance of fully penetrating it.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"Hunting horrors are often called on to perform tasks for wizards or priests, but they are themselves notable scholars of magic. While very few ever bother to become actual spellcasters, their ability to manipulate magic allows them significant variety and alacrity when it comes to generating magical effects. Many hunting horrors take to the creation of magic items, but they are unconcerned with scaling their magical devices for other users, which reduces their utility for smaller creatures. A hunting horror that focuses on item creation generally replaces its Combat Casting feat with [Craft Wondrous Item](feat/craft_wondrous_item).",
			"",
			"### Origins",
			"",
			"As with many of the monsters that have come to be associated with the Cthulhu Mythos, like the byakhee, the dark young of Shub-Niggurath, and the gnoph-keh, the hunting horror's original incarnation in fiction was as a vague fragment and a few evocative words. Sandy Petersen ran with these scraps when creating the bestiary section for the Call of Cthulhu RPG, and fully fleshed out the hunting horror into an iconic monster in its own right."

They occasionally travel to the surface, usually during heavy downpours, emerging into lakes, streams, swamps, and sometimes wells. Inquisitive and aggressive, hyaleths come to the surface to explore and to hunt sentient humanoids. Despite their large size, hyaleth can swim and hide in surprisingly shallow waters, allowing them to remain undetected while approaching their prey. Once it closes in on a target, a hyaleth uses its stinger to deliver a paralyzing neurotoxin before engulfing its victim within its elastic body.

Some hyaleths are tasked with caring for the eggs, while others defend the colony or gather food and knowledge for their queen.",

Hyaleths aren't evil, but their little-understood motivations and aggressive behavior frequently put them at odds with other races.",
			"",
			"Hyaleths eat almost anything they can catch, as their digestive acids can break down nearly any kind of material. Even more than food, hyaleths desire knowledge, which they most often acquire by absorbing the thoughts of creatures they engulf. Hyaleths simply digest any unintelligent or dim-witted creatures they engulf, but they place intelligent creatures into a deep sleep, reading the victim's thoughts as it falls into slumber. A hyaleth derives great pleasure from drawing out this knowledge, and it subtly changes color while doing so, its transparent body rippling through several hues in delight. When a hyaleth identifies and engulfs a creature with exceptional intelligence, it returns to the deep to deliver the victim to a gigantic hyaleth queen.",

They can live for hundreds of years, constantly harvesting vast amounts of information from a continual stream of creatures brought to them by hyaleth scouts.

			"A hyaleth queen is a Gargantuan hyaleth advanced by adding a +8 racial bonus to all of its mental ability scores, and at least 5 Hit Dice. A hyaleth queen can engulf Large or smaller creatures and can automatically engulf sleeping or helpless creatures expelled by an adjacent hyaleth. A hyaleth queen can selectively apply either option of its adaptive digestion ability to each creature it has engulfed, judging whether each can add to its eclectic store of knowledge or is suitable only as nourishment."

It is unknown what drives Dhirgiska to protect its lair so fervently, and some think that the beast was left by the deceased people of the village in order to protect their secrets and treasures. Whatever the case, it is well known that those who dare face the ruins and the beast that dwells within rarely come back alive.",

Most ichthyocentaurs worship deities of nature, beauty, and passion, as well as godlike elder fey.",

An ikelos can suppress or reactivate its aura as a free action. Ikeloses are immune to this ability. The save DC is Charisma-based.",

			"Ikeloses are monsters that lurk just out of the sight of insomniacs; they are nightmares that freeze the body even as the mind recoils in horror.",
			"",
			"To those who are fully awake, an ikelos remains unseen, a silently invisible nightmare that can travel undetected wherever it pleases. Only supernatural vision or drowsy eyes perceive these creatures. Ikeloses are painted in the colors of dreams-constantly warping hues that cannot be reproduced with light or pigments, and as such are impossible to accurately remember.",
			"",
			"An ikelos is frightening in aspect, appearing as a distorted humanoid with large eyes and elongated limbs. Its flat, ovoid face has the barest hint of a nose, and its mouth is a barely noticeable seam until distended to reveal row upon row of sharp teeth. An ikelos's short wings are unnecessary for its flight, but when unfolded, they give the creature the illusion of size. Many a dream-addled victim has mistaken an ikelos for a sinister fiend or an avenging angel.",

			"Ikeloses are commonly the size of a human, though both larger and smaller members of their kind exist. As incorporeal beings, they are entirely weightless.",
			"",
			"Ikeloses are born in dreamscapes in the Dimension of Dreams. They begin as recurring nightmares. When they've fed on enough fear, they create bodies from planar gossamer that can survive even as their dreamscapes crumble each morning. Eventually, a mature ikelos rides its dreamer back to the Material Plane, usually drawing its first meal from the unwitting \"parent.\"",
			"",
			"Although they don't need to eat or breathe in the conventional sense, ikeloses draw sustenance from fear. They use fear to mend their wounds and replenish their dream-spun forms. Deprived of this emotional fuel, they eventually waste away to nothing.",
			"",
			"An ikelos's frightful gaze is often enough to extract the emotion it needs. By returning to a victim several times a week, it can, in theory, sustain itself without killing the victim. In practice, however, such unfortunate souls often die of fright or sleep deprivation, or else seek means to ward off their tormentors. Against a victim that resists its paralyzing gaze, an ikelos resorts to violence. The resulting corpses usually foment more fear and sleeplessness in others.",
			"",
			"An ikelos could rely solely on its aura of lethargy to tire its victims and quickly extract their fear. But being born from nightmares, ikeloses see such direct tactics as inelegant, and take pride in creative plans that slowly drive their victims mad. As a few surviving victims remember from the monster's taunts, ikeloses claim that fear tastes better when it has time to ripen. When an ikelos is threatened, it doesn't hesitate to unleash its aura of lethargy and viciously claw apart whoever stands in its way.",
			"",
			"Ikeloses usually prey on insomniacs, those most prone to weariness and paranoia. In a pinch, they drift around invisibly during the day, searching for anxious individuals to target. They prefer to torment prey with alien whispers and intrusive thoughts-which become increasingly diffficult to dismiss as days pass into weeks-before revealing their true forms. Many ikeloses dislike that diviners can grant themselves and others the ability to see them, and target these spellcasters out of spite. Magic that pierces invisibility reveals ikeloses but, as with fatigue, makes the viewer more susceptible to ikeloses's malignancies.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"Ikeloses exist wherever sentient creatures dream, especially poor urban areas where hopes die and anxieties run high. Though they don't need to sleep, ikeloses become torpid during the day, anticipating their nocturnal games.",
			"",
			"An ikelos's alien mind is ever turned toward finding suitable prey and devising new and unexpected ways to horrify. Typically loners, ikeloses sometimes form packs-not for companionship, but to aid in their hunting. Like a wolf pack, ikeloses surround their prey, increasing the chance that the victim will be paralyzed or unable to flee. Interactions between such ikeloses are usually contests of dominance. While food and mating are of no concern to these creatures, the dominant ikelos makes most of the decisions for the group; ikeloses crave autonomy as much as any living thing hungers or lusts. Acts of deviousness and depravity are the usual measure of standing. Knowing it can't heal in a normal fashion, an ikelos almost always avoids committing violence against others of its kind, unless it can do so without anticipation of reprisal.",
			"",
			"Ikeloses don't interact with living creatures except to harvest their fear. Even were they not often invisible and intangible to most beings, they have little desire to socialize with creatures they consider food. However, as parasites, they can be found living invisibly amid all manner of creatures. An ikelos might seek to defend its \"cattle\" from other predators-whether monsters preying on its human stock or adventurers slaying its hobgoblin victims-or else seek to harvest a new source of fear. Creatures who are immune to fear cannot sustain an ikelos's unnatural existence, and thus hold little interest for these stalkers.",
			"",
			"Occasionally, ikeloses encounter creatures similar to themselves, such as house-haunting undead or soulharvesting night hags, and choose to form temporary alliances. Such a creature might complement the ikelos's abilities, and an ikelos has no use for its victim's bodies or souls. However, such alliances can prove tenuous and dangerous for both sides. Perhaps the creature most similar to an ikelos is an animate dream. While animate dreams are non-specific fragments of a single dream, ikeloses are specific figures that build up strength across multiple dreams. Ikeloses and animate dreams each believe themselves to be superior manifestations, and when an ikelos and an animate dream set their sights on the same prey, the conflict typically ends in violent confrontation."

			"**Impale (Ex)** When an impaler shrike has a creature at least one size smaller than itself grappled in its beak, it can move the creature to a dangerous location, such as a spike or a broken tree limb. This works like the reposition combat maneuver, except the shrike can move an opponent to an occupied square. An impaler shrike still provokes an attack of opportunity using this ability, so it typically pins its victim before attempting this maneuver. As part of this reposition, an impaler shrike can attempt a melee touch attack against an AC of 15 to impale the victim on a nearby spike or similar object. If this attack is successful, the victim takes an amount of piercing damage appropriate for the impaling object's size (see [Improvised Weapons](rule/weapons)).",
			"",
			"#### Description",
			"",
			"Much like their much smaller cousin, the common shrike, these giant shrikes are fond of impaling their prey before feeding. An impaler shrike catches a creature in its powerful beak, and drags the poor victim to a large thorn, splintered tree branch, or even a building's spire where it then impales the creature and leaves its victim to die, so it can pick away at the carcass at its leisure. Unlike the smaller common shrike's regular meals of insects and vermin, these large birds are especially fond of trapping sheep, dogs, and other small mammals for consumption. Though they typically favor smaller mammals, these voracious birds are not above attacking humanoids. A full-grown giant shrike stands nearly 9 feet tall and weighs approximately 125 pounds."

If its master is slain, the impundulu seizes its former master's soul, retreats to a hidden place, and consumes the soul, after which it metamorphoses over the next 24 hours into its natural form, regains all of its normal abilities, and becomes free; most aging masters pass on their impundulu familiars to younger family members rather than let the creatures turn on them.",

This form usually resembles that of a jungle shaman, except it has claw-like fingernails and its feet end in talons. In this form, it cannot fly or use its breath weapon, electrical discharge, or hook attacks. An impundulu can remain in this form indefinitely. Its natural form is its bird form. If killed, it reverts to its true form.",
			"",
			"**Witchcraft (Su)** An impundulu serving as a witch's familiar gives its master additional spells known, just like a witch's patron. The master must choose from one of the following patron themes when binding the impundulu, and this choice cannot be changed without dismissing and re-summoning the impundulu: Agility, Elements, or Transformation. These patron spells known are in addition to any granted by the witch's actual patron.",
			"",
			"#### Description",
			"",
			"The tribesfolk of southern Garund tell tales of a ruthless winged shapeshifter, a bloodthirsty demon and hunter of men. They call this being impundulu, a name that loosely translates to \"lightning-bird\" after its savage avian form. Legend describes this creature as a huge, stork-like bird that rides upon fierce storms and whose dark feathers crackle with lightning. It is believed that an evil shaman summoned the first impundulu and that using an ancient, taboo ritual, the two formed a blood pact. The shaman offered the impundulu the ability to wear his mortal flesh in exchange for mastery over the demon's significant occult powers. As soon as the impundulu seized control of the shaman's body, it broke the pact- however, the ancient ritual bound the fiend to the mortal form, and even after the shaman perished, it could not shed its flesh. Thus despite its own immortality, the impundulu became forever tied to the realm of mortals. For this reason, it is said, the creature continues to forge pacts with mortal spellcasters in the hope that one day it will unbind the secrets of its cursed existence.",
			"",
			"### Impundulu Fat",
			"",
			"The impundulu's fat possesses magical properties and is a highly sought reagent among tribal witchdoctors throughout the Mwangi Expanse. When properly rendered with a DC 28 Craft (alchemy) check, the fat becomes approximately 1 cup of sticky, highly combustible oil. Weapons dipped in the oil gain the flaming property for 10 minutes; 1 cup of this oil can coat up to five weapons or 50 pieces of ammunition.",
			"",
			"Similarly, the oil dilutes healing potions while maintaining their strength at the original concentration. One cup of oil can dilute one potion of cure serious wounds, two potions of cure moderate wounds, or 20 potions of cure light wounds, doubling the number of potions as a result (one potion becomes two, two become four, and so on). These potions cannot be diluted further without losing their potency."

The victim is killed instantly, and becomes a zombie-like creature under the incutilis's control. This zombie isn't treated as being undead, and is immune to spells and effects that affect only undead (including damage from positive energy). The incutilis is attached to this zombie-typically by the head-occupying the same square and moving along with it. The incutilis can make attacks with its tentacles independently of the zombie's slam. It can also retract its tendrils as a move action, but doing so causes the zombie to collapse and revert to a normal corpse. The incutilis must retract its tendrils before it can move away from a zombie it's attached to. Any attack that deals damage to the zombie also deals 1 point of damage to the incutilis, regardless of how much damage is dealt to the zombie. Area-affecting spells affect both the puppeteer and zombie. A character can attempt to attack just the incutilis, but takes a -4 penalty on the attack roll. Killing the incutilis destroys the zombie.",

			"A strange sort of sea creature that appears to be an oversized cephalopod, an incutilis hides a significant intelligence behind its unassuming appearance. Though most incutilises live their entire lives within the deepest trenches of the darkest seas, some venture to the border between water and land, taking terrible control over land-dwelling flesh with an alien disregard for sentient life. Because of their aquatic physiologies, their ability to cross this border and travel on land is limited. These aberrations overcome this hurdle with a lethal solution, slaying land dwellers and commandeering their flesh to bear the incutilis on shore.",
			"",
			"Although incutilises can live as bottom feeders, they prefer not to scavenge. Their favorite foods seem to be larger sea creatures-sharks, whales, and sentient ocean dwellers-and they make no distinction between the living and the dead. Incutilises exhibit strong self-preservation compulsions, going out of their way to avoid dangerous predators. When one is on land and its zombie puppet is destroyed, it attempts to flee to the nearest body of water.",

			"**Black Coral Secretion (Ex)** An incutilis lord's tentacles generate an oily black residue that quickly hardens into a dense, coral-like substance. A single application covers a 5 foot square and completely hardens in 1 minute, even when exposed to water. This substance is malleable until hardened, allowing an incutilis lord or the lord's minions to shape it into armor, walls, and more. Once calcified, it has a hardness of 4 and 8 hit points per inch of thickness. An incutilis lord can produce one application of black coral per Hit Die each day.",
			"",
			"**Calcified Minion (Su)** A calcifying stinger imparts a strong psychic connection between a calcified target and the incutilis lord who implanted the stinger. Once the target succumbs to the incutilis lord's will (see the calcifying sting ability, below), the target's whole body is infused with new secretions that allow the incutilis lord to dictate the target's actions and restore any Dexterity lost to the calcifying sting, as the secretions assist the minion's movement rather than hindering it. The incutilis lord can control a number of minions equal to its Charisma modifier as a free action. If the incutilis lord attempts to control a new minion in excess of this limit, it must first release one of its current calcified minions; see the calcifying sting ability, below. The minions have no will of their own but retain a small portion of their identity, giving the incutilis lord access to their feats, physical skills, extraordinary abilities, spell-like abilities, and supernatural abilities. A calcified creature moves under the direct control of its incutilis lord until the stinger is removed from its body. While under the incutilis lord's control, a calcified minion takes its own normal actions each round, as directed by its controller. A minion can survive this process for a number of days equal to its Constitution score. After this time, the calcified minion dies, though its body retains a semblance of life. The dead minion is treated as a living creature and can be controlled in the same fashion as before until the calcifying stinger is removed or the incutilis lord that controls the creature dies.",

			"**Calcifying Sting (Su)** The tentacles of an incutilis lord inject a painful stinger that constantly generates a black coral secretion. A creature stung by an incutilis lord must attempt a DC 19 Fortitude saving throw at the beginning of every turn until the stinger is removed. Each time it fails this save, the creature takes an additional 1d6 points of damage and 2 points of Dexterity drain. If this causes the creature to reach 0 or fewer hit points or a Dexterity score of 0, it loses all will of its own and immediately comes under the control of the incutilis lord (see the calcified minion ability, above). As a swift action, the incutilis lord can psychically command one of its stingers to remove itself from a stung creature, releasing its control over that creature. Another creature can forcefully remove a stinger from a willing or unconscious target by a succeeding at a DC 19 Heal check. Regardless of whether this Heal check succeeds or fails, attempting to remove the stinger deals 1d8 points of damage to the target. If the stinger is removed or the incutilis lord dies, the fluid seeps out of the controlled creature's wounds and the creature is released from the incutilis lord's control-though the creature may be dead by that time. The save DC is Constitution-based.",

			"",
			"Incutilis lords attack with barbed tentacles, inflicting a painful sting and injecting a calcifying agent that transforms living tissue into a dense black growth resembling a cross between chitin and coral. The stinger anchors the incutilis lord's senses in a calcified minion, leaving a disturbing exoskeleton that moves the minion about at the monster's whim. Unlike the mindless zombies that serve a more common incutilis, an incutilis lord's servitors retain muscle memory and a grasp of their magical abilities. An incutilis lord can survive for decades by feeding on the body and psyche of a single Medium-sized victim, but rarely settles for having only one minion to manipulate or feed upon.",

The tribe's shaman or chieftain accompanies the candidate in order to perform the profane rituals necessary for the transformation. Once above the snow line, the candidate is subjected to a week-long ritual designed to sever its connection to the spirits of its ancestors, the intent being that the future indarugant can do whatever must be done to protect the tribe without fear of offending the spirits or bringing dishonor to the tribe. At the ritual's conclusion, the candidate is killed with a single blow to the head, then buried in the ice and snow along with the weapons and tools it will use once it rises as an indarugant. How long it takes the indarugant to rise varies-some rise as early as the following evening, while others remain in the ice for months or even years.",
			"",
			"Not all giants who agree to undergo the transformation successfully complete their promise. Many lose their gall at the ritual's outset and attempt to escape back down the mountain to safety. Those who flee are hunted ruthlessly by their fellow pilgrims and the rest of the tribe, who fear offending the spirits. If possible, such escapees are captured alive and brought back to the frozen heights to undergo the ritual at spear point. This forced ritual does not produce an indarugant, but serves as a deterrent to those who would think to renege on their commitments in the future.",
			"",
			"Some tribal leaders claim that those who successfully escape their promise to serve as an indarugant are cursed. They say that these traitors to their people transform into even more grotesque and sinister creatures, though no evidence of such monsters exists-these claims are widely thought to be a scare tactic to elicit compliance.",
			"",
			"Those that successfully undergo the transformation come back changed. They are no longer constrained by moral concerns such as honor, fear, or mercy. Indarugants are capable of committing any act, no matter how taboo, so long as it furthers the interests of the tribe and its people. They treat their foes with such brutality that even the most wicked of giants cringe at the sight.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"Indarugants reside high in the mountains of Varisia, in places where the snow never melts. They hide themselves away in glacial caves, deep foreboding crevasses, and other secluded chasms where only those initiated into the secrets of their creation will know to find them. In times of need, a giant shaman or oracle will journey to the hidden places, braving the dangers of the cold and high elevation in order to beseech the indarugants for aid. Usually this aid comes in the form of exacting violence against the tribe's enemies, as indarugants are powerful warriors and cunning strategists. Rarely, an especially evil or desperate tribe may entreat an indarugant to serve as its chief or shaman, though usually only for a limited period of time, and only when the tribe is leaderless and under dire threat.",
			"",
			"Whatever form the indarugant's aid takes, it comes at a steep price. A giant who would petition an indarugant for aid must first swear a profane pact with the creature to someday undergo the transformation and become an indarugant itself. Once the indarugant has accomplished its agreed-upon task, it will lead the petitioner back up the mountain to its desolate home, and perform the necessary rituals to add the petitioner to the ranks of the undead. This serves both as a deterrent to keep the giants from calling on the indarugants too readily, and as a way to ensure the indarugant population grows along with the tribe. In this way, the tribes of giants will always have guardians waiting for them in the high ice, ready to defend them against any threat.",
			"",
			"Scholars of giant lore claim that all the races of giants once buried their dead in this manner, or at least created indarugants through similar rituals, if they did not live in icy climates. In Varisia, this changed during the Age of Legend, when the runelords of Azlant enslaved the giants and bent them to their sinister will. Those giants who fought back against the runelords called upon the might of their undying ancestors, sending legions of indarugants down into the plains to defend the giant tribes. Though the undead guardians fought fiercely, they were unable to stand against the might of Thassilon, and all were eventually destroyed. Since that time, only the taiga giants, who largely escaped slavery, continue the practice of creating indarugants. This may not be true for much longer, however, as reports of stone and frost giants burying their dead in the high ice now grow ever more common."

			"From the deepest regions of the Darklands come the strange creatures commonly called pallid wrigglers. Originally bats mutated by mad derros to enhance their natural abilities, the wrigglers have slowly evolved to their current form. A wriggler's wormlike body is supported between anywhere from two and six wings, four to eight legs, and possibly a collection of tails. Each creature lacks a head, and instead has merely a pair of grotesque nostrils, which create the trademark sound that both aids it in hunting and overwhelms its prey's senses.",
			"",
			"These creatures aren't terribly dangerous individually, but meet any disturbances in their territory with swift and often deadly investigation. The creatures immediately swarm any intruders, trying to learn their scent from as close as possible. They seem driven more by curiosity than animosity, but the resultant battering and probing can occasionally prove fatal. Pallid wrigglers are herbivores, feeding on the fungus that is ubiquitous in their cavernous lairs, so creatures slain by their attentions often rot away unless eaten by another scavenger."

Most assignments require additional intelligence to identify the epicenters of insurrection, so a hykariut often recruits teams of spies and informants to remain properly apprised. Although the inevitable might mentor some of these assistants-particularly if doing so would help steer them on the path to defend law in the future-these teams are ultimately temporary structures that the hykariut politely leaves once its mission is over.",
			"",
			"Despite these ephemeral personal connections, hykariuts are fairly gregarious when between assignments. They spend considerable hours reviewing revolutionary literature to better understand and dismantle rogue ideologies, and a hykariut can spend hours engaged in \"good natured debate,\" which typically translates to its stubbornly arguing against unstable political philosophies. At its core, a hykariut views mortals as conflicted creatures with unpredictable moods that require regulation. Hence, the inevitables usually approach small-scale revolts with the firm but gentle hand of a scolding adult. Ongoing revolution, particularly that led by one or more demagogues, earns less mercy. A hykariut has no compunctions against publicly pulverizing a mutinous leader as an object lesson in civic obedience for wide-eyed onlookers.",
			"",
			"Hykariuts work together only rarely, and only for far-reaching or tenacious rebellions. A pair of hykariuts has monitored Galt's Red Revolution since its infancy, regularly meeting with and dispatching spies to measure scores of qualitative variables. Despite the immense amount of data collected over the decades, these inevitables haven't moved against the Gray Gardeners or Revolutionary Council-much to the hykariuts' mortal agents' distress. It may be that the inevitables believe the Galtan incident contained, or that they have calculated the frequent upheavals that replace each Revolutionary Council serve as a lesson to other mortal societies to avoid the same mistakes."

			"Monarchs, dictators, governors, and mayors may rule under the pretense of sustaining lawful civilization, yet those who abuse their power or harm their people undermine the foundation of government. To the forces of Axis, these bad actors represent a threat to cosmic order and a means by which the chaos of uprisings and revolution can take hold. The mortal agents of lawful deities are responsible for encouraging responsible governance; where they fail, an impariut must intervene.",
			"",
			"Each impariut is a stern counselor sent to reform a powerful leader, guiding that figure toward sustainable policies that maintain order. Unlike many inevitables that care only that the universal order is upheld, impariuts exhibit slightly more patience and flexibility, knowing that an iron-fisted response is as likely to trigger riots as a negligent regime. As a result, impariuts are capable diplomats and teachers, equally proficient with incentives as with unflinching punishments.",

Whereas a petitioner's memories are all but destroyed when creating most inevitables, impariuts maintain a fundamental sense of their accomplishments and failings during their mortal lives-all the better to recognize these deeds in others. Each impariut also bears a slightly different appearance that reflects the designs and fashion of its former existence, such as wearing the colors or regalia associated with its former kingdom. That said, most of every impariut's appearance, knowledge, and morality is standardized, infused into its body upon its creation. This knowledge includes an encyclopedic expertise on mortal history, law, methods of civic administration, and social welfare.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"Impariuts engage in extended assignments beyond Axis, often infiltrating a royal court for several weeks to learn about a disreputable ruler. After assembling a proper profile of the target, the inevitable typically approaches the wayward ruler in private to reveal its true identity, enumerate the ruler's foibles, detail the likely consequences of continued negligence, and provide an assessment of how best to correct the situation. In a typical case, the impariut offers the ruler its ongoing assistance as an advisor to help steer the leader back to a proper path. However, if at any point the inevitable ascertains that the ruler is beyond redemption, it is empowered to execute the head of state and shepherd the best suitable replacement. This replacement is usually the legal heir, but if that individual is also deemed to be dishonest, an impariut will balance public sentiment with legal entitlement to identify the best candidate.",
			"",
			"When a ruler's deposition seems immediately necessary, an impariut might forego private counseling and cast off its disguise to condemn a wayward ruler before a crowd, snatch his crown, and hurl him from his seat of power. In rare cases in which corruption is widespread, an impariut might gather a local council of lesser leaders to establish a new government in as peaceful a way as possible. The only taboo for impariuts is that each avoids directly intervening in any nations it ruled during its mortal life. This does not prevent an impariut from answering a distant descendant's question if contacted directly, but impariuts view anything more than this reactive assistance as a conflict of interest.",
			"",
			"As inevitables, impariuts are physically tireless and capable of working for centuries at a time. However, extended exposure to irresponsible governance sometimes erodes an impariut's judgment or causes it to take especially drastic measures when a lighter hand would suffice. These rogue impariuts are very rare, and each one rebels in its own way; one might become a serial killer of monarchs, whereas another might establish itself as the leader of a nation. Other inevitables or lawful outsiders usually neutralize these malfunctioning impariuts swiftly. To minimize these transgressions, senior inevitables encourage impariuts to return to the Eternal City between assignments. There these inevitables can bask in the perfect orderliness, grounding themselves and mentally preparing to guide another generation of imperfect nobles. Impariuts between assignments share information freely, evaluating and circulating the most effective leadership techniques, disciplinary tactics, and methods of avoiding any unintended consequences of their intervention.",
			"",
			"Even though impariuts most often answer orders from Axis, a mortal spellcaster can petition an impariut to serve as a counselor for a careless king or tutor for an adolescent heir. So long as the inevitable's proposed pupil seems able to learn and rule, an impariut might charge as little as 500 gp per month of non-hazardous instruction.",
			"",
			"Those spellcasters who would instead force an impariut to obey can placate it by offering rare history volumes and noteworthy biographies, gaining a +1 bonus on the binder's Charisma check for every 100 gp worth of literature provided (maximum +4). At the same time, though, an impariut judges the conjurer, assessing whether the spellcaster might ultimately undermine the region's rule of law-and whether to destroy the conjurer at a later date."

If the target creature fails a DC 16 Will save, it must conform unerringly to specific cultural traditions or customs chosen by the kastamut. Each time the cursed creature fails to perform a customary ritual or tries to commit a prohibited act, it must attempt a new Will save at the same DC. If it fails, it is forced to conform to the culture's accepted mores. If it succeeds, its actions are not restricted, but it immediately takes 2d6 points of nonlethal damage and gains the sickened condition until it resumes following the chosen customs. This curse remains in effect for 1 year or until the afflicted creature benefits from a break enchantment or remove curse spell (use the kastamut's caster level for associated caster level checks). This is a mind-affecting, compulsion effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.",

Yet, even as the laws governing the multiverse have been altered over time, so too has the role of the inevitables changed. Beyond defending Axis's borders, inevitables were tasked with seeking out threats to the order of all things. To fulfill these missions, the axiomites created many more types of inevitables. Among the lesser known are the kastamuts, charged with protecting the traditions of cultures spread across the Great Beyond.",

Depending on how long a kastamut has been in service, dents or cracks may mar its metallic shell, evidence of past battles against rebels and renegades.",

They oppose sudden, radical changes in the course of a culture's traditions, and work to prevent the destruction of established belief systems, rites, and social customs. While some kastamuts carry out this task by protecting a society's heritage sites, most work directly against agents of change-internal or external-that threaten a civilization.",

Even fundamental shifts in the beliefs shared by a large group of people are allowed, so long as they progress along the lines of a normal cultural development. What kastamuts do work against are immediate, substantial changes, such as when a new ruler outlaws a nation's long-standing religion and seeks to wipe out all practice of the old faith in favor of a new one, especially if the new religion has no precedent. Turning slowly from old ways to new ones can be part of the natural order, but violently rebelling against traditional practices in favor of untested systems gives rise to chaos, which the powers of Axis cannot abide.",
			"",

			"",
			"Dwarves are the most likely to have dealings with kastamuts, as they take their traditions much more seriously than most other races. Dwarves' long lifespans mean that any changes in custom that do take place usually happen very slowly, but they are more prone to violent upheavals than elves, increasing the chances that a kastamut will get involved in order to prevent things from changing too much at once.",
			"",
			"Kastamuts find human civilization vexing. Humans' comparatively short lifespans and their tendency toward individualism create countless variations of culture and tradition and introduce the high probability of sudden and radical change. Only human civilizations that manage to survive 20 or more generations seem to acquire the metaphysical depth necessary to gain the Godmind's attention.",

A few of these inevitables are believed to operate in the jungles of the Mwangi Expanse, working against those Chelish colonists seeking to quell resistance by the region's indigenous population. Pathfinder Society reports also indicate that at least one kastamut haunts the western border of Irrisen, working against white witches and their minions who attempt to eliminate the many Ulfen tribes that dwell there. At the same time, kastamuts have also appeared in Irrisen and Nidal to oppose rebels seeking to undermine the cultural status quo."

It can throw two bolts of energy as a standard action, and cannot attack with these hands when it makes weapon or slam attacks with its other limbs.",
			"",
			"**Immunity to Energy Spells (Ex)** A lhaksharut is immune to any spell or spell-like ability with the acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic descriptor that allows spell resistance.",

			"",
			"#### Description",
			"",
			"A typical lhaksharut is a six-armed construct that appears to be made of a mix of metals and stone. Where a human would have legs, it instead possesses a complex orb of spinning rings similar in shape to an orrery-it is this whirling machine that grants the lhaksharut the ability to fly. Though a lhaksharut has huge, metal wings, they serve as little more than stabilizers when it's in flight. Four of the construct's arms end in functional hands that it normally uses to carry a mix of weapons. The lhaksharut's lower two arms hold large, flaming metal spheres in their hands-it uses these spheres to generate elemental bolts of energy that it can hurl great distances to damage foes.",
			"",
			"Lhaksharuts are tasked with maintaining the separation between different planes of reality, especially the elemental planes. They do not concern themselves with petty trespasses by visitors from one plane to another, nor even the occasional creation of a pocket plane or hijacking of a chunk of one reality to serve as a base within another. What does trouble a lhaksharut is anything that represents a permanent link between planes, or an effort by the denizens of one plane to invade and conquer another. They often find themselves in conflict with the machinations of powerful outsiders who seek to create beachheads on other planes to serve as launching pads for massive incursions.",
			"",
			"When possible, a lhaksharut enforces the separation of planes through the simple expedient of smashing any device that creates a dangerous breach, or killing any creature that seems determined to mix or blend realities. The inevitable does not care why such infractions occur, and is often deaf to any excuse suggesting even a temporary linking of planes is a good idea. However, while singled-mined, a lhaksharut is not mindless or incapable of reason. They are emotionless, but can be negotiated with if a problem cannot be solved by smashing and killing violators.",
			"",
			"Rarely, a lhaksharut can even be convinced that maintaining a planar link is important enough to let the gate stand, if only temporarily. In such cases, the lhaksharut always volunteers to guard the portal until the time comes to shut it down. These arrangements must include a detailed explanation on how a desired course of action will directly lead to meeting the lhaksharut's goal. Only when facing the most overwhelmingly powerful foe does a lhaksharut agree to assist in a task not related to its primary function, and then only to win allies to help it achieve success in an area where the lhaksharut has already met with failure. Even if convinced to undertake such an alliance, a lhaksharut is likely to insist its mission be accomplished first. A creature of pure order, a lhaksharut is incapable of defaulting on a promise made in good faith, but it is aware that not all creatures are so bound. If for some reason the needs of its allies must be put first, a lhaksharut insists on guarantees that its allies will meet their commitments to it once they have what they want.",
			"",
			"In combat, a lhaksharut uses its speed and mobility to get close to targets. A lhaksharut sees groups as imperfect machines, and knows that the best way to overcome them is to disrupt their smooth functioning. While creatures able to directly harm the inevitable are dealt with if necessary, it much prefers to first eliminate healers, scouts, and shield-bearers before tackling powerful fighters or spellcasters. A lhaksharut cannot be taunted or baited into changing its course of action-it is completely emotionless and only cares about the efficiency of its battle plan. It also fights without care for its own survival, trusting that either its regeneration will restore it to life, or a new inevitable will be created to replace it.",
			"",
			"When unaware of a threat to the sanctity of the division of the planes, and not threatened, a lhaksharut can be a surprisingly good conversationalist. They are as likely to be found floating through a void as maintaining any kind of stronghold. Lhaksharuts are aware that the domains they wish to patrol are too vast to be directly viewed with any efficiency. Some lhaksharuts thus forge networks of informants who can patrol the many planes, and send word to the inevitable to alert it of any apparent breaches. The constructs have no other need for the treasure that they gather from transgressors, and sometimes even pay for tips that might lead to a planar infraction. Anyone who might prove to be a valuable informant is treated with respect, and may even be able to gain insights into the planes from the lhaksharut's vast knowledge on the subject, as long as questions never wander into the dangerous territory of combining two planes.",

			"**Dismantling Gaze (Su)** Once per round as a swift action, a yarahkut can concentrate its gaze on any item within 100 feet and damage that item. Attended items must succeed at a DC 21 Fortitude save or lose half their hit points and gain the broken condition. Items that already possess the broken condition and fail this save are destroyed. Items that successfully save against this effect are immune to that yarahkut's dismantling gaze for 24 hours. Unattended non-magical items don't receive a saving throw. The save DC is Charisma-based.",
			"",
			"**Malfunctioning Aura (Su)** A yarahkut radiates a disruptive aura that is harmful to ranged weapons within 100 feet. Mechanical projectile weapons-such as crossbows, firearms, siege weapons, and many technological weapons-have a 20% chance of not firing on each attack made within the aura's area. If a weapon in this aura has a misfire value, its misfire value increases by 2.",
			"",
			"**Wings (Ex)** A yarahkut's wings are primary attacks.",
			"",
			"#### Description",
			"",
			"Yarahkuts are inevitables tasked with preventing magic and technology throughout the cosmos from falling into the wrong hands. Their mandate is to track objects that could disrupt the development of cultures that are not yet ready to wield such power. In most cases, yarahkuts monitor the movement of advanced technologies and magical items from lost civilizations, ensuring they aren't introduced to regions where they could have a disruptive impact.",
			"",
			"Noted for their intricate brass wings, yarahkuts have superb control of these appendages and are able to use them as effective weapons. Three identical faces surround a yarahkut's head, staring impassively in separate directions with glowing golden eyes. Of its two sets of arms, one set bears claws for combat, while the remaining set is more humanoid and is used to manipulate objects-including those items it confiscates. A yarahkut stands 11 feet tall and weighs 3,000 pounds.",
			"",
			"These inevitables scour the planes for those in possession of items beyond their ability to control-or more accurately, beyond what the yarahkuts believe they can control-and ensure that such items do not remain in unsafe hands for long. Each yarahkut has jurisdiction over a specific territory and monitors its region for such trespasses, tracking any new piece of technology or major magical item that enters its assigned area. If an item is determined to be a threat, the yarahkut pursues its retrieval or destruction without reservation.",
			"",
			"A yarahkut's distinctive wings are for more than just flight; the inevitable has remarkable control over these mechanical appendages. The wings are just as sharp and dangerous as its razorlike claws, and double as weapons in combat. The grace with which yarahkuts use their wings awes members of many primitive cultures, who often mistake these inevitables for celestials. Only those familiar with the nature of yarahkuts understand that their wings are weapons first, and a mode of transportation second.",
			"",
			"Compared to most other types of inevitable, yarahkuts take extra care to avoid being destroyed on their missions. While all inevitables know that if they're destroyed, replacements will simply emerge from the forges of Axis to continue their work, yarahkuts understand that their destruction would extend the time that significantly advanced items are allowed to contaminate their assigned territories. Bereft of any form of innate teleportation or planar travel, yarahkuts are willing to retreat from combat if it means surviving in order to gather reinforcements or formulate a new plan.",
			"",
			"Yarahkuts are supported in their task by a wide array of abilities; those who study these inevitables learn to fear their dismantling gazes in particular. Just by scrutinizing an item, a yarahkut is capable of disassembling it in a manner of moments, to the dismay of those who wield dangerous items against the inevitable. Yarahkuts also exude an aura that tampers with nearby mechanical items. This aura causes mechanical weapons such as crossbows and firearms to become misaligned and misfire, and can affect even advanced technology such as laser weapons.",
			"",
			"Once a yarahkut has tracked its quarry, it uses its innate arcane sight to identify any threats that require disposal and unceremoniously relieves the target of these items. Once the transgressor has had its dangerous possessions removed, the yarahkut uses its mind-affecting abilities to strip relevant memories from the target. If the target has expert knowledge of technology or has been exposed to dangerous items for long periods of time-such as a gun maker in a primitive land or an engineer who built a weapon that could instantly destroy millions-the inevitable resorts to a thorough memory wipe or simple execution.",
			"",
			"**Family:** [Inevitable](family/inevitable)",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"Yarahkuts are mostly solitary outsiders, each with its own \"jurisdiction\" consisting of a meticulously assembled base of power and network of contacts from across the planes. Whenever possible, yarahkuts attempt to stay removed from the mundane affairs of the material world, running their networks through intermediaries and sending agents to investigate dangerous items before committing to a mission themselves. Those in service to a yarahkut rarely realize the true nature of their benefactor, whose identity is disguised by the inevitable's heightened ability to understand and adapt to other cultures. After reviewing the intelligence gathered by their agents, yarahkuts begin planning their retrieval missions. They are meticulous creatures, and attempt to plan for as many contingencies as possible to ensure success.",
			"",
			"As they lack innate means of traveling the planes, yarahkuts may seek aid in arriving at the location of this wayward technology-including help from mortal spellcasters who summon them. Some conjurers seeking to bind a yarahkut tempt it with information about dangerous or prohibited technology being used in the inevitable's jurisdiction. Most conjurers fail to realize, though, that the yarahkut often already knows of the dangerous technology, word of which likely trickled through its established network of informants long ago; the yarahkut had counted on being summoned so it could pursue the item itself.",
			"",
			"In rare circumstances, yarahkuts form alliances with others of their kind. These alliances most often occur in response to the distribution of a large cache of volatile items across overlapping yarahkut jurisdictions, or the unearthing of dangerous artifacts with immediate repercussions for a large region.",
			"",
			"Sometimes yarahkuts seek out other types of inevitables when the need arises. For example, a situation in which a powerful undead creature has discovered a lost army of robots may prompt an alliance of convenience with a marut. If a bargain was broken regarding powerful technology, a yarahkut might instead align with a kolyarut, while a death-marked exile from Numeria bringing stolen items to other nations might necessitate working with a zelekhut in order to track the renegade down."

Needless to say, few inverted giants tried their masters' patience again, and the unimaginable pain they suffered throughout the rest of their days served as a maddening punishment that would remind them of their insolence until their merciful deaths.",

Those who find themselves exploring Thassilonian dungeons and ruins sometimes stumble upon such horrors, inadvertently releasing the monsters and restoring them to raging life and madness, the pain of their mutilated bodies having long since driven them to insanity and burning hatred.",

They have no true eyes-what oracular systems they once had are now embedded somewhere near their sternums-but instead possess an innate sense of direction, and through the dark arcana that surges through their beings they can sense the location of their prey perfectly. Their moist, splotched bodies are marked with runes, and their muscles and bones are often visible through their translucent flesh.",

			"Very little is known about these enigmatic and mysterious creatures, as their very nature makes details of their true form difficult to discern. Brought to this world from the Plane of Air, these creatures fulfill tasks for those who conjure them. Invisible stalkers act as guardians, assassins, and trackers, occupations in which they excel. Their natural invisibility and skill at stealth allow them to follow their quarry without detection and give them the upper hand when it comes to exterminating a mark.",
			"",
			"Many invisible stalkers resent this and see these petty tasks as nothing more than chores dictated by mortals. When given a particularly complex or bothersome task, an invisible stalker seeks to find a loophole in a poorly worded instruction. For instance, wizards calling an invisible stalker into service with the instructions \"protect me from danger\" might find themselves escorted to a faraway hidden location, or even brought to the Plane of Air.",
			"",
			"Due to their constant summoning, many invisible stalkers harbor hostility for those dwelling on the Material Plane. Those invisible stalkers new to the mortal world only know the stories of their kind and tend to keep an open mind about the intentions of those who call them. Over time, or in the service of a particularly vile master, invisible stalkers form negative opinions of these creatures of flesh and bone, leading to their tendency to pervert their instructions and cause harm to their masters. For older and more experienced invisible stalkers, the only thing protecting those who summon them is the magic that binds them. These creatures automatically try to use inconsistencies in the wording of their tasks and literal twists on the intention to find a way to inconvenience, injure, or even kill the priest or arcanist that brought them to the plane."

These actions are declared in the same manner as readied actions. If a declared action is impossible to complete or becomes impossible to perform (such as performing a full attack on a creature that is no longer adjacent), that action is lost. The irii is aware of what actions an affected creature intends to take. A nondetection spell renders a creature's fate unreadable and negates this effect.

			"Iriis are natives of the Dimension of Time, but are often mistaken for angels or fey. Iriis have two distinct variants depending on their beliefs and roles with regard to time, and are locked in a civil war over their differing philosophies. Iriis who view time as rigid and immutable are lawful neutral and refer to themselves as Fates; they have the heads of animals-usually big cats, jackals, bulls, or beetles-and wings made out of glass and gold, with unblinking eyes encircling their necks. Iriis who see time as elastic and entropic are chaotic neutral and call themselves Fortunes; they have human faces, golden horns, and insectile wings. Due to their constant battles over ethos, these two aspects were considered to be entirely different species, until a Fate was observed bursting open and releasing a Fortune from within its body. Further study confirmed that Fortunes can likewise become more rigid in outlook and transform into Fates. What triggers these changes in aspect is unknown, but interviews with the iriis themselves suggest a single irii may be composed of multiple Fates and Fortunes, and they appear as separate creatures only because their appearances are filtered through mortals' unsophisticated perceptions of time and reality.",
			"",
			"Iriis are gregarious despite their alien mind-sets. While they most often remain in the Dimension of Time, fighting to either destroy or preserve alternate timelines that never became reality, they are known to don mortal guises and walk the Material Plane. Diviners and those who meddle with time, as well as major events in history, attract iriis, sometimes prompting them to stay and work toward their own peculiar ends. Fate iriis believe that both the past and future are set in stone, and consider anything that attempts to change either to be world-threatening meddling; they help prophecies and destinies come to pass and harry those who would alter history. Fortune iriis delight in destroying predetermined events as well as subtly modifying those that have past, splicing portions of alternate histories into the timeline to replace events that have been rendered impossible by temporal tampering. All iriis work to preserve the timestream, however- though Fates and Fortunes disagree on how elastic time is, they both agree that it should flow smoothly from prior actions into future consequences. As such, they always band together to defend the timeline from events and powers that could devour the past, erase the future, or destroy the integrity of time itself, shattering existence into an endless series of temporal paradoxes.",
			"",
			"Though iriis are rarely malicious in their actions, they are unsafe creatures by any metric. Their relationship with time means they rarely see a creature's death as an ending, causing iriis to sometimes act callous toward others. They can be invaluable patrons to people they take an interest in, especially scholars who seek out mysteries beyond the known multiverse, but these mysteries tend not to be healthy for mortal minds-and once an irii's attention is gained, there is no escaping it in any timeline.",

It doesn't gain the grappled condition when using its chains to grapple enemies, and can maintain a grapple using its chains as a free action, though doing so prevents it from attacking with that chain. An iron rhinoceros may have up to two creatures grappled in its chains at a time. Additionally, the chains seek to ensnare creatures the rhino tramples. The chains entangle any creature that fails its saving throw against the rhinoceros's trample attack, or that chooses to forgo its save in order to make an attack of opportunity against the rhinoceros. An entangled creature can escape from the chains as a standard action by succeeding on a DC 26 Strength check or a DC 20 Escape Artist check. Each chain has AC 12, hardness 10, and 15 hit points.

The rhinoceros must make this choice at the beginning of its charge.",

Hatches on the rhinoceros's sides allow it to swallow creatures grappled in its chains. In order to take swallowed creatures prisoner without dealing fire damage, the rhinoceros can suppress (or activate) the flames within its furnace as a swift action. When the rhinoceros is suppressing the flames, the furnace instead fills with smoke, forcing swallowed creatures to succeed at a DC 17 Fortitude save each round or be sickened for as long as they remain in the rhinoceros's belly. This save DC is Constitution-based. Creatures attempting to cut their way out of the iron rhinoceros's belly must overcome the durability of the thick furnace walls (hardness 10).",

The results were initially promising, as these unintelligent creatures obeyed without hesitation and executed their orders with mechanical precision.

Few generals were willing to ride a mount that might turn on its rider, and so these first creations were deemed unreliable and most were broken down for scrap.",

Although any sufficiently experienced and equipped spellcaster can create one, something in the mechanical beasts' construction predisposes them to favor giants over other creatures. While they might remain loyal to their creator, iron rhinoceroses display aggression toward any other non-giant creature they meet. These tendencies, combined with the creatures' immense size and strength, make them dangerous to keep in even lightly civilized areas.",
			"",
			"Among some fire giant communities, iron rhinoceroses are a mark of status and power. Many fire giants assume that a general who possesses and commands one has been successful enough at war to afford the exorbitant cost of the beast's creation. Because iron rhinoceroses cannot (or will not) bond with a new master after their creation, elders rarely pass them down along family lines or to successors. Up-and-coming fire giant generals are expected to produce their own iron rhinoceroses to prove their worth as military commanders. In truth, few iron rhinoceroses survive their masters, as both tend to fall in battle against more powerful enemies. On the rare occasion when an iron rhinoceros does outlast its owner, the construct is placed within its master's tomb to serve as a guardian for his body and grave goods. Desperate or foolish young commanders sometimes attempt to steal iron rhinoceroses from the tombs of their ancestors, hoping to gain the prestige that comes with ownership without first proving themselves in war. These young generals more often than not end up impaled, making their attempted theft readily apparent to whatever unfortunate giants must clean up the mess.",

			"#### Description",
			"",
			"Little more than orange-tinted, blistered flesh drawn across skeletons, the irradiated dead were once humanoids-mainly Kellid warriors-who have been tainted by the radiation that's strewn across Numeria. Created as a result of experiments by members of the Technic League, a handful of irradiated dead escaped their restraints and set off across Numeria, creating more of their kind with each kill. With the strange chemicals and radiation coursing through their bodies and augmenting survival and hunting instincts, they scour the Numerian wastes in search of prey. Irradiated dead generally appear the same size as the humanoids they once were, but they weigh less due to their bodies have been ravaged by radiation.",
			"",
			"### Ecology",
			"",
			"The secretive cabal known as the Technic League has always looked for ways to bolster its military power beyond the use of the gearsmen. Over the past couple centuries, the League's members have made numerous foul discoveries by studying the strange relics, technologies, and chemicals collected from the ruins of Divinity.",
			"",
			"Originally conceived by a Technic League lieutenant as more reliable and easily replaceable minions than the gearsmen, the irradiated dead were the result of a series of experiments conducted in the shadow of the Silver Mount. The lieutenant was skilled in the use of necromancy magic, a study not normally mastered by Technic League members. She gathered a group of the strongest young warriors in Starfall-all of whom sought to make names for themselves in the service of the Black Sovereign-and subjected them to round after round of brutal endurance tests, injections of chemicals and drugs, savage bloodletting, and forced starvation until their bodies couldn't take any more.",
			"",
			"The lieutenant administered to the warriors a number of chemical compounds recovered from a medical bay within Silver Mount that were originally intended to aid the crew of the Divinity in surviving in strange and hostile environments. Lacking full understanding of what they were working with, the lieutenant and her apprentices mixed and distilled these strange chemicals into a viscous, orange fluid that augmented physical strength and coordination while also thickening the outer layers of skin to a rocklike hardness. She believed that replacing the subjects' blood with the orange liquid, along with controlled exposure to a smashed piece of wreckage leaking radiation, would yield the obedient soldiers she desired. When the first two test subjects completed the regimen, they awoke with a savage hunger for the flesh of their kind and rose up to fight her. The lieutenant escaped that first trial with only the loss of her right eye and her right hand just above the wrist. Her two apprentices were not so lucky. Subsequent refinements and tests yielded no better results. Though these latest test subjects retained their free will, their hunger for raw flesh was just as potent as the earlier attempts. And as they're generally more powerful than their Technic League creators, the irradiated dead saw no reason to serve their creators in any way.",
			"",
			"Not long after these experiments, several irradiated dead were turned loose or escaped. Rumors persist within the Technic League of study specimens that were kept in secret, and some foolish young sub-commanders are looking to restart the project.",
			"",
			"Burning inside with necrotic radiation, the irradiated dead display enhanced strength and coordination. Their skin and pupils are tinted pale orange like the fluids that replaced their blood. Their fingers transform into savage claws as sharp as ragged metal. Unexpectedly, the creatures show a remarkable resistance to the effects of positive energy that are deadly to most other forms of undead. They are also carriers of the radiation treatment that fueled their transition to undeath, able to pass the affliction to other living creatures.",
			"",
			"Irradiated dead are carnivorous, greatly preferring fresh meat, but they aren't above eating carrion. Cunning, patient and careful hunters, irradiated dead can prey on a nomad tribe over months, ambushing small bands of warriors and feeding upon them one by one.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"Most irradiated dead are natives of the broken Numerian wastes, and they continue haunting these regions in their new forms just as they inhabited the wastes in life. They generally search for new hunting grounds in solitude, but those that manage to create their own spawn travel in packs with those they have transformed. Whether roaming across the plains, hills, and valleys, or even wading through muck and waterways, they spend much of their time lurking in shadowy places on the outskirts of villages or tribal encampments. They do not generally keep personal possessions or treasure from their meals, but may use such things to lure and entrap subsequent search parties.",
			"",
			"Though they're intelligent, the irradiated dead rarely show any inclination toward forming social groups or hierarchies, preferring to kill and eat creatures that enter their territories, though they will deal with other intelligent creatures if they must. If they encounter more powerful beings in their hunting grounds, irradiated dead will work to trick or trap them. The irradiated dead simply move on to new territories if they are unable to eliminate the threat. An unconfirmed report by a Technic League spy in Sunder Horn, however, claimed that at least three fast-moving, orange-skinned creatures had been hunting on the outskirts of town for nearly a year. The creatures have seemingly disappeared without any further sightings in the last 18 months.",
			"",
			"Even the Technic League is aware of the dangers these creatures could pose to the populace. The methods used to create the irradiated dead are well-guarded secrets of the Technic League. These techniques are also impossible to implement outside of Numeria, because the necrotic radiation and alien chemicals instrumental to their creation can be found nowhere else on Golarion."

			"Mercifully, isonades spend much of their existence in hibernation. When an isonade is preparing to hibernate, the population in its area of the ocean drops drastically while the beast consumes huge quantities of food. Though an isonade will eat just about anything that bleeds, it favors massive beasts to minimize time spent hunting-such as giant squid or whales-though it will resort to eating hundreds of fish once larger prey grow scarce. It's also intelligent enough to know that a seafaring vessel contains a large quantity of warm and screaming snacks all isolated in one convenient place. An isonade can hibernate for hundreds of years, waking only when its vast store of food has been exhausted or when startled by a natural disaster, such as an earthquake or volcanic eruption.",
			"",
			"Because of this long hibernation, rumors of isonades are often exaggerated and relegated to myth, making their exact territories hard to predict when they awaken once again. The isonade's eating cycle provides indicators of its return. An abundance of fish in a region can signal a hungry isonade's territory, as sudden explosions in the fish population sometimes occur when these beasts begin devouring the region's larger predators. An isonade shakes off its torpor by eating the large, slow animals in the depths, but inevitably circles upward as its appetite grows.",
			"",
			"An isonade can live for over 10,000 years, and can grow to over 70 feet in length. An adult isonade weighs approximately 300,000 pounds."

			"**Dual Form (Ex)** An ixion worm can take one of two forms: a serpentine skin-sack of clattering bones, and a taut, self-ambulatory wheel. An ixion worm in its wheel form possesses the euphoric gaze, hypnotic wheel, and powerful charge special abilities. When in serpentine form, the ixion worm gains a 10-foot bonus to its speed, a climb speed of 10 feet, a +2 dodge bonus to its Armor Class, and the constrict special attack.

The effect is persistent but immediately ends if the ixion worm threatens or is threatened by a creature, uses any other special abilities, or moves in any way but a straight line.

Its bones can slither as a crooked serpent or join at the ends to form a wheel, with its face freely sliding around the structure to spin on one side of the hub as it rolls itself around. The rotation amplifies the ixion worm's hypnotic abilities, which it uses to motivate Phlegethon's petitioners into working harder in the layer's mines and forges.",

The worm's size and mass-5 feet wide, 9 feet in radius in wheel form, nearly 30 feet long unrolled, and 600 pounds in weight- also make the creature a terrifying physical force as it careens down the narrow paths of Phlegethon's crags. The ixion worm's entrancing gaze and mental powers, however, are what make it an effective and intimidating enforcer; few of Phlegethon's lesser inhabitants consider challenging what they quickly believe is their only friend in Hell.",
			"",
			"When petitioners slack in their work, an ixion worm snakes into place, forms a wheel, and lulls them into a trance by rolling in hypnotic patterns until the rocky layer of Hell seems to become a twisted fantasy: a rolling field of rotting food to the gluttonous, for instance, or an endless sea of writhing, formless flesh to the lustful. The few who dare to disobey are either smashed under the wheel's rim or suckled in its warped mouth, where its soul-draining spit strips away what little individuality and vitality a creature retains.",

			"Belial smiles upon ixion worms that excel at their tasks and promotes them to serve as pulley wheels in his forges' machinery.

These elevated ixion worms endlessly plead for devils and broken souls alike to show gratitude to their diabolic benefactors, lest they too become little more than implements of Hell.",

			"In his covetous lust for his mother-in-law, the self-styled King Ixion lured his own father to death in a spiked pit trap.

Ixion spitefully responded by expressing his distaste for Belial's palace and declaring the archdevil's finest souls far too ugly. In a fit of mirthful wrath, the archdevil ripped the former king's soul apart and had him reforged into a worm of bones.

To further mock Ixion, who still searches Phlegethon in anonymous bitterness for the souls of his wife and mother-in-law, Belial commanded his forges to craft the souls of every familial betrayer sent to Phlegethon into the cyclops king's likeness."

Alternatively, the jabberwock can focus its burble attack to create a 60-foot line of sonic energy that deals 20d6 points of sonic damage (DC 31 Reflex save for half).

Small or smaller creatures in this area that fail a DC 15 Strength check are blown away. See page the wind effects table for further details on the effects of severe winds.",
			"",
			"#### Description",
			"",
			"The jabberwock is a true creature of legend-a subject of poetry, song, and myth in many cultures. It is known to be a devastating creature in combat whose arrival presages times of ruin and violence; these stories also tell of the creature's fear of the tools some say were created in ancient times for the sole purpose of defeating them-vorpal weapons. A jabberwock is 35 feet tall and weighs 8,000 pounds.",
			"",
			"The jabberwock is not a creature of the Material Plane, but one from the primal world of the fey. It comes from a region of reality where life is more robust, where emotions are more potent, and where dreams and nightmares can come alive. Even in such incredible realms, though, the jabberwock is a creature to be feared. It belongs to a category of powerful creatures whose shapes and types run the gamut of possibility-a group known collectively as the \"Tane.\" Of the Tane, the jabberwock is said to be the most powerful, but the others in this grouping are far from helpless. Said to have been created as goliaths of war and madness, dreamt and stitched into being by the strange gods of this primeval reality, the Tane are as mysterious as they are powerful. Two other creatures of the Tane are presented in this book-the sard and the thrasfyr. None of the Tane are lower than CR 16 in power and all possess the planar acclimation special quality, but beyond that, they generally share no specific abilities or characteristics save for their common source in the primal world.",
			"",
			"When a jabberwock comes to the Material Plane, it does so to spread destruction and ruin. Typically, the monster seeks out a remote forest lair at least a day's flight from civilization, then emerges from this den once a week to seek out a new place to destroy. It has no true interest in amassing treasure, but often gathers objects of obvious value to bring back to its den in order to encourage heroes to seek it out-to a jabberwock, it makes no difference whether it seeks out things to destroy or lets those things come to it.",
			"",
			"Jabberwocks age, eat, drink, and sleep like any living creature, but they do not reproduce in the classic sense of the word. The creation of a new jabberwock-or of any of the Tane, in fact-is regulated by the strange and unknowable godlike entities that dwell in the primeval world. These fey lords create new jabberwocks as they are needed-sometimes varying the exact particulars (see Variant Jabberwocks, below), but always creating a fully formed adult creature. No young jabberwock has ever been encountered as a result.",
			"",
			"The strange vulnerability a jabberwock possesses against vorpal weapons has long been a matter of intrigue and speculation among scholars. Most believe that, once upon a time, only one jabberwock existed, a creature of such great power that nothing could hurt it. Nothing, that is, save for a legendary sword forged for a mortal hero by a now-forgotten artisan or god. So epic was this battle that it created strange echoes throughout reality, and as a result, these echoes, in the form of the vorpal swords and jabberwocks known today, can be found on many worlds.",
			"",
			"### Variant Jabberwocks",
			"",
			"The notion of a \"lesser\" jabberwock is something of a misnomer, for even these creatures are powerful foes. A lesser jabberwock is generally a CR 20 version of the typical jabberwock-you can achieve a creature of this power by lowering the typical jabberwock's Hit Dice by 3 and by reducing its ability scores by 4 points each. Alternatively, you can apply the young creature simple template, but bear in mind that such a monster isn't technically any younger than a typical jabberwock.",
			"",
			"As creatures from the primal world of the fey, some jabberwocks are as varied as the strange terrains and realms in that primal world, as if these environs have more to do with their manifestation than most scholars suspect. Generally, these changes simply alter the type of damage a jabberwock's eye beams deal and the types of energy it is immune to. A jabberwock from a primeval glacial world would possess eye beams that deal cold damage, while a jabberwock from a storm-lashed world would deal electricity damage with its eye beams. If the nature of a jabberwock's eye beams change, its burn ability changes to match, and it replaces its immunity to fire with immunity to the new energy type (while gaining resist fire 30 in place of the lost immunity to fire)."

Although considered craven and foul by humans, jackals are relatively friendly and gentle with members of their own small packs.",
			"",
			"Attracted to the edges of human settlements in their territory, jackals often make opportunistic raids on fruit crops and vulnerable domesticated animals. They're also attracted to large deposits of garbage that they can sift through for leftover food. Jackals are remarkably adaptable, and readily forage for insects or fruit, feed on found carcasses, or hunt small or vulnerable game as the opportunity presents itself.",
			"",
			"Jackals are notorious for their craftiness in evading pursuit, and they've been known to feign death when caught in order to lull opponents into complacency and gain another chance to escape. A jackal can attempt a Bluff check opposed by its opponent's Sense Motive check to play dead. If successful, after combat ends, the jackal can begin a new encounter with surprise. During the surprise round, only the jackal and any opponents who succeeded on their Sense Motive checks can act."

When conditions are right, jellyfish shift from being a nuisance to being a menace, if accidentally so, for a jellyfish swarm, unlike more aggressive monstrous kin like the giant jellyfish, comprises not aggressive hunters but rather opportunistic strikers. They do not generally move to attack nearby prey, but their nearly translucent coloration makes it horrifically easy for a creature to swim into a swarm unawares. Once a jellyfish swarm deals damage to a creature, the swarm pursues it for several rounds before giving up the chase. Many aquatic races use jellyfish swarms as defensive guardians, trusting a swarm's lack of interest in moving to keep it stationary for long periods of time."

			"",
			"**Slashing Talons (Ex)** The tips of a kaicharek's tentacles are covered in serrated bone blades, causing them to deal slashing damage and bleed damage instead of bludgeoning damage.",
			"",

			"",
			"With slashing tentacles and a blood-hungry maw, kaichareks lie in wait for the foolish entering [Achaekek's](faith/achaekek) realm, ambushing and exsanguinating the weak and grabbing a quick meal from the strong. This latter feature has earned kaichareks the name \"parasites of Achaekek.\" Though hardly the strongest creatures associated with the Mantis God, kaichareks are vicious yet cowardly creatures that seem to live for the anguish and bloodshed they unleash on the world around them.",
			"",
			"A typical kaicharek is 5 feet long and weighs 270 pounds.",
			"",
			"Kaichareks seem to live only to hunt, digesting only some of the blood and gore they consume from prey and storing the rest in their thick bodies to be digested later during lean times. This seeming lack of reliance on consumption has led some planar scholars to theorize that kaichareks derive sustenance from some other source, possibly the psychic trauma their attacks cause.",
			"",
			"When hunting, the kaicharek uses two different methods depending on the size of its prey. Against prey the same size as the kaicharek or smaller, the creature strikes from hiding or by using its magical ability to hide its presence from others. It lashes out with its razor-tipped tentacles and bites, attempting to grapple its prey. When it gets ahold of a victim, it devours it as messily as possible, thrashing about violently and reveling in its bloody meal.",
			"",
			"The second method of hunting is reserved for much larger prey that a kaicharek believes is alone. The kaicharek still attacks from hiding, but instead of merely biting its prey, it activates a more focused version of its magical abilities, hiding itself from its prey's awareness and hanging on as a leech or other similar parasite. This feeding continues until its prey collapses, exsanguinated, or it discovers the kaicharek. The latter usually occurs when the parasite spills the excess blood onto the nearby ground, which not even the kaicharek's magical stealth can hide.",
			"",
			"If either of these methods fail, or their prey proves more formidable than anticipated, the kaicharek immediately flees, burrowing underground if possible. The cowardly creature rarely stays away for long, however, seeking to finish off weakened prey or exact bloody revenge for its humiliation.",
			"",
			"One of the more vicious abilities associated with these predators is their ability to overextend their tentacles to attack from a greater range-a feat accomplished by a combination of muscle spasms, fluidic action, and tearing of the internal ligaments holding the tentacle together. After overextending its tentacles, a kaicharek must spend a few seconds retracting the tentacles back and activating a focused, specialized healing ability to repair the internal damage. A kaicharek can even regrow a severed tentacle, although this process takes several hours.",
			"",
			"Kaichareks are an autogamous species and self-fertilize, laying their eggs in pools of blood left behind by their own attacks or in bloody remnants left by larger predators. When blood is plentiful, a single kaicharek can produce dozens of offspring in a few months.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"The parasites of Achaekek can be found anywhere in the Blood Vale, Achaekek's realm in the tunnels beneath Pharasma's Boneyard, and their preferred hunting grounds always have plenty of soft soil and hiding places in which to stalk and ambush prey. Kaichareks sometimes wander into the Boneyard, though these expeditions rarely last long, as patrols of [vanth](monster/vanth) and [esobok](monster/esobok) psychopomps slay kaichareks on sight. Other kaichareks make their way to the Material Plane, either through thinned planar boundaries or by way of mortal conjurers.",
			"",
			"Normally solitary hunters, kaichareks only rarely associate with others of their own kind, often treating each other as prey. However, during lean times, the blood-hungry beasts band together, ambushing larger groups, overlapping their magical stealth to confuse prey, or even overwhelming a single massive target in hopes of bringing it down. Exactly how kaichareks communicate is difficult to determine, but they seem to use gestures and traced messages written in blood. Regardless, such alliances last only until food becomes more plentiful or the kaichareks become hungry enough to turn against one another.",
			"",
			"Kaichareks do not realize it, but they are at the core of a split among Achaekek's worshippers. As kaichareks are known to infest Achaekek's realm, some worshippers of the Mantis God summon them in a misguided attempt to gain favor with the indifferent Achaekek. The cult of the Red Mantis, on the other hand, holds a particular disdain for kaichareks. They view the parasites as utterly lacking in strategy or resourcefulness, despite their intelligence. Worse, most kaichareks' tendencies to indiscriminately parasitize stronger creatures violates the cult's philosophy of holding leaders or rulers in high regard. The fact that kaichareks don't recognize this hierarchy marks them as worse than beasts in the cult's eyes.",
			"",
			"The exact relationship between Achaekek and these parasites is unknown. It seems unlikely that the creatures are creations of the Mantis God, as creating entirely new races is uncharacteristic of the bloodthirsty deity. One theory holds that Achaekek discovered kaichareks on some Material Plane world, took a liking to them, and transported some of their race back to his domain. For their part, kaichareks look upon their deific patron with a mixture of fear and awe, viewing him as an apex predator that they know can snatch them up as morsels. Some kaichareks dare to feed upon Achaekek directly, and those that aren't immediately destroyed for this hubris gain quasi-divine powers, setting them above their brute kin."

			"",
			"**Create Carrionstorm (Ex)** As a full-round action at sunrise, a kakuen-taka (a bhoga swarm with a flesh mansion) can create 1d4 [carrionstorms](monster/carrionstorm). These carrionstorms have a blinding poison in addition to their swarm attack. The carrionstorms are not under the control of the kakuen-taka but instinctively follow it, attacking minor foes while the kakuen-taka destroys greater threats.

			"**Flesh Mansion (Ex)** A kakuen-taka's bhoga swarm normally inhabits a hollowed-out reconfigured corpse called a flesh mansion, which it uses as a shelter, vehicle, and war machine. When the swarm wears a flesh mansion, it uses the above stat block (unlike a normal swarm, the flesh mansion's slam attacks have reach and threaten squares within its reach). As a standard action, the swarm can abandon its flesh mansion (which falls inert in its square), inhabit an empty flesh mansion, hide within its flesh mansion (gaining cover against all opponents but still being able to use its swarm attack), or stop hiding within the flesh mansion. If the flesh mansion is destroyed, the swarm can create another by performing a ritual that requires 1 hour and the corpse of a Huge creature. The flesh mansion is not a separate creature, nor is it undead; it is merely a corpse the swarm manipulates. Without a flesh mansion, the bhoga swarm's statistics are CE Diminutive outsider (chaotic, evil, extraplanar, swarm); AC 22, touch 21, flat-footed 15; Defensive Abilities swarm traits; Melee swarm (5d6 plus dimensional snare and distraction); Reach 0 ft.; Str 1; CMB -; CMD - (can't be tripped); Stealth +32.",

The swarm takes only half damage from all attacks that deal hit point damage, with the remainder taken by the flesh mansion. Because a swarm of Diminutive creatures is immune to all weapon damage, apply half of all weapon damage to the fleshy shield and ignore the half that would be applied to the swarm. When the flesh mansion reaches 0 hit points, it is destroyed and the swarm functions like a normal swarm (see Flesh Mansion above). A kakuen-taka can repair a damaged flesh mansion by spending a full-round action grafting a corpse into it (restoring 5 hit points for a Small corpse, 10 for Medium, 20 for Large, 50 for Huge).",
			"",
			"#### Description",
			"",
			"In the far northern lands bordering on the Worldwound, a strange and terrifying menace plagues the tundra and prairie-shambling fleshy abominations called kakuentaka, the Hunger That Moves. They wander the desolate emptiness of the subpolar wilds, a living manifestation of the Worldwound's taint whose horrific onset is presaged by a sour-sweet wind and wheeling, screaming flocks of undead birds. The lucky victims of the birds' blinding poison are spared the sight of the rumbling juggernauts of putrefying meat driven like siege engines by a swarm of fiends called bhogas. Individually these fiends have little wit or skill, but together they have a malign intellect that allows them to construct mobile nests out of dead flesh like morbid termites building a mound.",
			"",
			"The bhogas find a giant, mammoth, or other creature of great size and devour its organs, usually while the creature is still alive and trying to resist. Once the creature is dying or dead, the fiends reconfigure the corpse's remaining flesh and bone into a hideous, multilegged pillar, which they then invade and inhabit like a hollow tree. Some of the bhogas use their collective strength to move the fleshy mansion's limbs while the rest clamber about its walls or skulk underneath it, searching for new prey to terrorize and consume. This monstrosity attracts birds the fiends animate as flesh-craving undead swarms. Together, the three components of this peculiar ecology stalk the demontainted lands. If a healthy swarm discovers another suitable corpse, the fiends engage in a frenzy of mating, build a second flesh mansion, split into two swarms, then rapidly give birth to fill all the available space in their new home.",
			"",
			"When a flesh mansion becomes so rotted that it cannot maintain its structure or the swarm cannot easily move it, the bhogas abandon their creation and seek out another, leaving behind a monstrous, decaying shell, unrecognizable as the living creature it once was. Necromancers can use the husk for parts or animate the entire thing as a new abomination. Desperate ghouls, zombies, or animals might feed on it and become tainted by its latent Abyssal energies.",
			"",
			"As much a plague upon demons as upon the mortal races, kakuen-taka have no true allies. Perhaps this accounts for their constant wandering and their fondness for desolate and isolated locales, far from any that might interfere with their feasting. Rarely, a powerful demon might enslave one with magic and use the swarm's dimensional snare ability to capture and kill its rivals. Driven out of the central part of the Worldwound by more intelligent and organized demons, kakuen-taka have become a recurring plague in the southern fringes of the territory, below Storasta and abutting the borders with Numeria and Ustalav. In these lonely moors and hills, kakuen-taka regularly eradicate patrols and entire settlements. None of the adjacent countries values the empty lands highly enough to risk major resources to stamp them out.",
			"",
			"Kakuen-taka are indifferent to their own kind and attack each other only if one swarm has a flesh mansion and the other does not. Given adequate food, several kakuen-taka might travel together to tear apart larger prey, but over time they usually wander apart, following their separate carrionstorms, and have no sense of loyalty toward their former comrades."

Whenever a kamaitachi is caught within the area of effect of a spell or supernatural effect that alters or controls winds (including control weather and control winds), it must succeed at a Fortitude save to avoid losing control of its dust devil. The save DC is equal to the spell's save DC, or DC 20 if the effect isn't a spell or spell-like ability. If the kamaitachi loses control of its dust devil, it immediately loses its fly speed. It also loses the benefits of its dust devil ability and must succeed at a concentration check (DC = 15 + double the spell level) in order to use any of its spell-like abilities. A kamaitachi can reactivate its dust devil by casting control winds (but not wind wall); as such, a kamaitachi is hesitant to use its last control winds spell in a day in case it needs it to regain its dust devil.",

Helping travelers in this way makes a dosojin's ward sturdier and more straightforward, allowing creatures to reach their destination in half the time they would normally take (though this does not grant a bonus to creatures' movement speeds in combat).

They are often found in statue form at the edges of villages, along mountain passes, at the beginnings of tunnels and other major works of roadway construction, or at simple country crossroads. In urban areas, dosojins can sometimes be found on street corners and near bridges. They serve as the guardians of travelers, keeping the malicious and malevolent off the paths they diligently watch over. Wise travelers know to seek a dosojin's blessing before traveling upon its ward, for falling out of favor with the kami of travel is a sure way to become lost or hampered. Pious mortal couples also seek out dosojin for their own reasons, as the kami are often regarded as patrons of fertility, and are known for their habit of choosing mates and standing beside one another for their entire lives. In many regions, the blessing of a dosojin is believed to ensure a long and happy marriage, as well as many healthy children.",

			"As creatures that symbolize travel and connections, dosojins straddle the line between the lands of the civilized and the wild, often with one foot literally in each. Dosojins spend most of their time guarding their chosen sites in the form of nondescript statues and way markers, meditating motionlessly for seasons at a time. While semi-social dosojins within cities and other settlements are not uncommon, the majority of these kami stand along remote and secluded roads, going to great lengths to ensure that their true identity is not known. It is not uncommon for dosojins to create false duplicates of themselves using their stone shape ability, and these misleading markers inspire a certain amount of faith among those who look out for the kami of roads, as one can rarely tell if a sculpture is a dosojin by looks alone. A dosojin requires no sustenance, but it is not uncommon for travelers to leave offerings for a silent watcher, usually tributes of fruits, nuts, and potables, gifts that the kami gladly shares with hungry travelers, happy to inspire such good faith among passersby and to foster a system of give-and-take between strangers.",
			"",
			"Dosojins are fond of the creatures that traverse their roads and trails, and maintain the roadways they guard to ensure both the ward's survival and the safe travel of the voyagers that traverse it. Though they have an affinity for the creatures that constructed their roadways, dosojins still protect their wards with the aggressive righteousness typical of all kami, and scarcely hesitate when faced with an oni or other evildoer seeking to disrupt the balance. Dosojin have little patience for those who litter on their roadways or unnecessarily obstruct the paths, and they take it upon themselves to discipline those they deem worthy of punishment. Rarely violent in an overt sense, dosojins prefer to use their magic in order to trick travelers into becoming lost, letting the wilds they travel through become the primary instruments of their demise. Dosojins prove quite deadly to those who fail to show kami proper respect, as they use their powers of illusion to lead troublesome caravans into impassible ravines and destructive oni onto unsound, derelict bridges.",

			"Dosojins are odd among kami in that they are known to select mates from among their own kind, and it is not uncommon to see two seemingly redundant statues standing next to one another near a trailhead or fork in the road. While they do not reproduce in any typical sense of the word, dosojins are nonetheless sought out by mortal couples hoping to conceive, as many people see the kami as symbols of fertility. However, most scholars agree that dosojins do not collaborate in this way to foster fecundity, but rather act as symbols of camaraderie and companionship for travelers on their roads, encouraging teamwork and cooperation among groups of diverse individuals with a shared goal.",
			"",
			"While most dosojins are content to watch over particular highways or roads for their entire existences and act as helpful guardians for most passersby, some choose instead to act as appraisers of travelers' skills and bravery. Cunning individuals that indulge in acts of trickery more often than their tamer brethren, these rogue dosojins craft obstacles and trials for travelers they deem worthy of the challenge. The tests are not meant to substantially impede voyagers, and are simply forms of innocent fun that a dosojin uses to gauge the strength and resolve of various wayfarers. Those who surpass a dosojin's challenges (which usually take the form of puzzles or illusions) earn the kami's respect and the assurance of safe travel throughout the rest of its domain, while those who avoid the obstacle or overcome it through brutish and witless means garner only scorn. Careful travelers know to watch out for the statuelike kami when making their way along potentially protected roads, as the guardians expect voyagers to act honorably and respectfully while travelling upon their paths. Some of the most important mandates to keep in mind when interacting with dosojin and walking through their territories are as follows.",

			"**Aura of Fate (Su)** A dunagh merged with or within 120 feet of its ward radiates an aura of fate to a radius of 20 feet. Enemies within this aura must roll two d20s whenever a situation calls for a d20 roll (such as an attack, a skill check, or a saving throw) and take the lower of the two results. Allies designated by the dunagh in this aura likewise roll two d20s whenever a situation calls for a d20 roll, but can take the higher result instead. This is a mind-affecting morale effect that doesn't work on fey. A dunagh can suppress and reactivate this aura at will as a free action.",

Unlike others of their kind, however, dunaghs long ago attached themselves to caravans coming over the Crown of the World, eventually establishing themselves in the Lands of the Linnorm Kings, where they're most likely to be found today. Attracted by a family's or clan's intense devotion to a single structure or holding, the dunaghs serve as guardians of family homes, watchful protectors of both the structures and those who live within them.",

			"#### Description",

			"Spiritual guardians of ornamental shrubs and miniature trees, fukujin are highly regarded among Tians as bringers of good fortune and sound wisdom. Fukujins are thought to only come to goodhearted and devoted bonsai gardeners, and since bonsai plants are often only cultivated by astute and aesthetically minded humanoids, the kami are usually of a similar nature, speaking to mortals rarely and always cryptically. Regardless of how much of their coveted knowledge they impart upon favored mortals, however, fukujins always bring with them a sense of hope and good luck, and almost all within close proximity of the kami feel an instant sense of relief.",
			"",
			"Fukujins resemble humanoids with tree branches protruding from their bodies, most often their heads, and some fukujins possess leafy hair or treelike limbs. A fukujin in its physical form is only as tall as its bonsai ward-usually only a foot or two-and weighs less than 30 pounds.",
			"",
			"While many see the art of bonsai gardening as humanoids' attempts at controlling or forming nature, fukujins reflect the practice's virtues of patience and nurturing. Fukujins maintain that a moment of patience and study can reveal multitudes more than years of trial and error, and the diminutive beings spread this knowledge wherever they go. While kami do not reproduce in any typical sense, fukujins are known to sow seeds of bonsai plants in the wake of their footsteps, further delighting communities that appreciate such flora. Though assignment of kami remains up to the mysterious will of the gods, fukujins do their part in creating numerous hosts for these spirits.",
			"",
			"The health and strength of the tree branch protruding from a fukujin's head is often said to be a good indicator of the skill of the warded bonsai tree's caretaker. While the aesthetic values of bonsai trees are often completely subjective, the kami spirits are evidence that there is perhaps a series of core doctrines bonsai farmers should adhere to when taking care of their plants-ideals that a gardener can strive toward to ensure he achieves success in his maintenance of the small tree. A poorly trimmed bonsai plant may sicken the spirit for a time, for instance, while expert grafting can result in a strong or knowledgeable kami. In most cases, however, a kami will almost always leave its ward if a bonsai gardener neglects the plant long enough or effectively ruins the effort, for though fukujins are patient, they have little tolerance for the virtues of negligence and wastefulness.",
			"",
			"While nearly all fukujins are calm, collected, and patient spirits, the beings are by no means all the same, as their physical appearances, predispositions, and demeanors are just as often reflections of the particular bonsai plant that they watch over. Fukujins who reside within the hearts of deciduous trees, for example, tend to be of lighter color as well as more airy and spirited than the hardy and resilient fukujins of coniferous shrubs, who take on a red, earthy hue. Plant type can also hint at particular magical qualities the spirit might have-white-trunked trees tend to attract gaunter, more fatalistic individuals, while plants with brown or ebon bark inspire kami that are more attuned to the energies and mysteries of magic. The tree branch that sticks out of a fukujin's head while the spirit is in its physical form is often of the same variety as the bonsai tree that the kami protects, though exceptions have been known to exist among particularly dual-natured spirits.",
			"",
			"**Family:** [Kami](family/kami)",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"Since their wards are by nature the direct result of humanoid intervention, fukujins are naturally social creatures, and most seek to assist their humanoid partners in not only cultivating beautiful plants, but in all spheres of life. Many bonsai gardeners are often content to live in a permanent home, establish a family, and live a life of tranquility, and fukujins happily provide all manner of advice regarding these domestic issues. In other instances, however, fukujins have been known to travel alongside particularly adventurous cultivators, humanoids who keep the shrubbery and kami spirit in safe and comfortable packs or pouches and consult them for wisdom in circumstances both dire and unusual. The miniature kami's insights and good luck prove as useful in the heat of battle as in the hearthstone, and so humanoids from nearly all walks of life seek the favor of these beings.",
			"",
			"Bonsai trees are delicate plants and their kami reflect this fragility. What they lack in physical defenses, however, fukujins make up for in grace and keen insight, using their natural acumen to avoid and deter hazards before they're even encountered. Some might mistakenly see this expert passiveness as a manifestation of fukujins' philanthropic ideals and good intentions, but more often than not their flightiness is simply what they deem to be the wisest course of action. In situations where violence is inevitable, fukujins seek the aid of stronger individuals to help protect them, true to the tradition of their wards' reliance on humanoid intervention and maintenance. Rather than view this reliance on humanoids as a weakness, however, most fukujins accept it as part of a long-lasting transaction between the two forces, each providing unique benefits to the other throughout the relationship. To bolster this partnership, fukujins harness healing powers as well as the strength of their insight, ensuring that their caretakers remain healthy and able to protect the kami and their wards.",
			"",
			"While they almost always possess pertinent and useful advice, fukujins are known for being reserved under most circumstances, sharing what knowledge they have only when it is absolutely necessary, and they never share wisdom superfluously. Fukujins are normally individualistic and solitary like the plants they watch over, and when they interact with one another they usually do so telepathically. What people often perceive as the luck of fukujins is often merely the result of wise advice garnered from the spirits, though when asked if the kami really are bringers of fortune, fukujins are known to remain even more tight-lipped than usual.",
			"",
			"Occasionally one might encounter a fukujin in the wild, in lands far from the societies and plants where they commonly make their homes. In such cases, these miniature kami often claim shrubs, young plants, and even whimiscal-looking mushrooms as their wards, grooming nearby groves and glades into quiet meditation gardens or into artistic shapes, inviting visitors to rest and reflect."

			"**Infused Quarterstaff (Su)** Any quarterstaff a jinushigami wields functions as a +5 quarterstaff (unless the quarterstaff already has a greater enhancement bonus). If a jinushigami is within its regional ward, it can create a Gargantuan quarterstaff out of the surrounding terrain as a standard action.",
			"",
			"**Manipulate Terrain (Su)** A jinushigami can help any number of creatures travel within its territory. Creatures aided in this way receive a +10 bonus on Survival checks and do not suffer reductions to overland movement from terrain or lack of a highway or other roadway, regardless of the presence of roads or the type of terrain they actually travel through. Alternatively, a jinushigami can make terrain more difficult for any number of creatures to travel through, imparting a -10 penalty on all Survival checks and causing overland movement to be reduced to one-tenth its normal speed. A jinushigami can affect as many creatures as it wishes with this ability, selecting whether it aids or impedes travel for each, as long as it can notice the creature and the creature is within its regional ward. A jinushigami may use this ability while merged with its ward.",
			"",
			"**Ward (Su)** A jinushigami treats an entire region as its ward. This region can be a single forest, swamp, mountain, lake, or any other natural feature, with a maximum radius of 5 miles. Most jinushigami have smaller regional wards, since not all regions are large enough to fill this area, but no region with a radius smaller than 1 mile radius can support (or deserves) a jinushigami. As long as it is within its territory (either merged with it or in its physical form), a jinushigami can observe the world from any point within its regional ward as if it were at that point. While merged with its ward, it can observe all points simultaneously in this way. As a standard action, it can convey information about a creature within its ward (effectively imparting a description and exact location) to all kami within its regional ward.",
			"",
			"#### Description",
			"",
			"Guardians of significant natural wonders like mountains, large lakes, forests, and so on, jinushigami (known also as land kami) are the most powerful and revered of all kami, commanding the very forces of nature itself to ensure the safety and security of their wards. These potent spirits garner the most respect among other kami, wielding great influence over both them and the native creatures that dwell within their territories. Jinushigami tend to stay hidden amongst their land, however, knowing that their intimate tie with the environment makes them highly desirable targets among those who would seek to do harm to nature.",
			"",
			"Strangers to lands protected by jinushigami are well-advised to take the utmost care to not offend the powerful spirit creatures. When displeased, jinushigami can eradicate trails and warp the contours of their terrain, forcing travelers to endure unreasonable hardship in travel. These goliaths have little patience for those who would defile their efforts, and offenders who fail to listen to a jinushigami's initial hints quickly discover how devastating the kami's powers can be as they are forced from the land either by the lesser kami who serve their superior or by the towering jinushigami itself. Of course, those who respect and honor the jinushigami see the kami's other side, as the kami eases their travel by lessening undergrowth, shifting rivers, and otherwise providing subtle but incredible aid to travelers.",
			"",
			"Jinushigami are ancient and wise, and while they are no fools, they prefer to give visitors to their domains the benefit of the doubt. Only when an individual makes known his disruptive intentions toward the structure and cohesion of nature does a jinushigami react with violence. Of course, those who align themselves with naturally opposing forces of the kami, such as the oni, do not receive this friendly grace period, and a jinushigami can perceive most treacherous thoughts, sensing a suspicious visitor through its connection with the land, then tracking it down to stealthily observe it more closely.",
			"",
			"A jinushigami is 38 feet tall and weighs over 30,000 pounds. When they manifest physical bodies, they appear as lumbering humanoid forms made of earth and stone and plant matter, sometimes with strange humanoid affectations like hats or jewelry.",
			"",
			"### Elder Jinushigami",
			"",
			"Of all the kami, land kami are the most ancient and powerful, yet even among these immense outsiders there are variations in that power. Newly formed jinushigami have statistics as presented above, but a jinushigami grows more powerful as the legend and fame of the site it guards grows. For example, a jinushigami of part of a mountain range is impressive, but a jinushigami whose region includes the range's tallest mountain is even more so.",
			"",
			"When a jinushigami becomes this powerful, it is known as an elder jinushigami. An elder jinushigami is generally a Colossal creature, and rarely has fewer than 28 Hit Dice-most are between CR 22 and CR 25, although exact details vary. An elder jinushigami's ward can cover a much larger area than that of a typical jinushigami, usually with a radius of 1 mile per CR possessed by the elder jinushigami. An elder jinushigami also gains additional spell-like abilities to more closely reflect its role in the world. Listed below are several examples.",
			"",
			"Glacier Kami: An elder jinushigami associated with a vast glacier, be it one that carves mountains or runs along a polar coastline, appears as a humanoid made of blocks of ice.

			"Great Reef Kami: An elder jinushigami whose domain contains a sizable coral reef of considerable age appears as a humanoid constructed of living coral draped with seaweed. Great reef kami have the water subtype instead of the earth subtype, gain the aquatic subtype (and the amphibious special quality), gain a swim speed of 60 ft., and gain the ability to use tsunami once per day as a spell-like ability.",

			"Mountain Kami: When an elder jinushigami's ward includes the tallest peak in a range or region, it gains the use of flesh to stone and wall of stone three times per day each.",
			"",
			"Volcano Kami: An elder jinushigami that includes in its ward an active volcano appears as a humanoid made of equal parts molten rock and solid stone. A volcano kami has the fire subtype instead of the earth subtype (and thus gains immunity to fire and vulnerability to cold), can use fireball three times per day as a spell-like ability, and can use wall of lava once per day as a spell-like ability.",

The save DC is Constitution-based.",
			"",
			"**Storm Ward (Su)** A kaminari treats a specific mass of transient storm clouds as its ward. This storm is about 1 mile in diameter, and a kaminari can observe the world from any point within its storm ward, whether merged with it or in its physical form. A kaminari can only control the movement of its ward to a minimal extent, willing it to remain in one place or move in a cardinal direction for up to 2d4 hours every day. After this time, the ward continues on its natural course for 24 hours, after which the kaminari may will it to remain stationary again. When a kaminari is in its physical form and within its ward or within 120 feet of its ward's boundaries, it gains the power to call down bolts of lightning. The kaminari can call up to a total of 15 bolts of lightning each day, each of which deals 5d10 points of electricity damage. This ability is otherwise identical to call lightning storm.",
			"",
			"**Vulnerable to Silence (Su)** A kaminari constantly surrounds itself with sound and music, and can't stand any form of silence. Whenever a kaminari is affected by a silence spell or effect or is rendered deaf by any means, it loses its cacophonous blow ability and its fast healing for the duration of the effect. But because a kaminari possesses incredible resilience to such effects, any silence or deafening effect lasts only 2d4 rounds or as long as the effect's duration states, whichever is shorter.",
			"",
			"#### Description",
			"",
			"Kaminaris are robust spirits of enormous size that watch over the balance of weather, taking the form of violent storms wherever they go. More monstrous-looking and boisterous than most kami, kaminaris are often mistaken for oni upon first glance, their unpredictable natures furthering the confusion. Kaminaris care little for most mortals, primarily concerning themselves with the maintenance and protection of their wards' enormous storm clouds that represent the awesome power of thunder and lightning. In addition to their duties guarding their storm wards and the balance of weather, kaminaris are endlessly fascinated with musical instruments, particularly drums.",
			"",
			"Kaminaris have vibrant skin and equally colorful features; the specific hues vary from kaminari to kaminari. A kaminari stands roughly 25 feet tall and weighs about 10 tons.",
			"",
			"Though a kaminari commands the awe-inspiring powers of lightning and thunder as though they were simply extensions of itself, the kami of storms have limited power over their wards. As dictated by the obscure and convoluted Laws of Golden Perfection, a kaminari has only limited ability to will its ward to travel in any particular direction or halt its movement for a modest amount of time per day. Thus it is often merely a passenger upon the clouds of a storm. Though most storms collect and dissipate with some frequency, a kami-inhabited storm is more permanent than most weather patterns, and as long as both the kami and its ward are neither destroyed nor corrupted, the storm could exist for a potentially infinite amount of time.",
			"",
			"Kaminaris despise the use of magic to alter weather patterns, and attempts to disrupt their storm clouds often result in the enormous kami's unabashed and wrathful ire. A kaminari is as volatile as the storm it protects, and the powerful spirit is quick to exterminate any creature-mortal or otherwise-it deems a threat to the natural balance of weather. Whether an evil sorcerer is trying to bring devastation to a seaside town by calling forth powerful hurricanes or a benevolent wizard is summoning rain to save a desert city in the midst of a natural drought, if such manipulation comes to the attention of the watchful and wandering kaminaris, they find little forgiveness. This is not to suggest that the kami of storms are evil-their threshold for nuisances is simply lower than most kami, and their punishments more destructive.",

			"",
			"Floating thousands of feet above most civilizations, kaminaris are usually isolated from other creatures, and this suits the reclusive kami just fine. A kaminari does not interfere with the matters of mortals beyond the natural destruction caused by its storm clouds, and only aides such diminutive creatures when the task would be required of it because of some stricture of the Laws of Golden Perfection. Once a kaminari has fulfilled its required duty, it is only too happy to continue on its way, where it can remain uninterrupted as it creates its music and fills the air around it with thunder and lightning.",
			"",
			"A kaminari is as devoted to its ward as it is to the practice of music, and the intensity of the storm it sits upon usually corresponds to the amount of aggression with which it plays its instrument. While it rarely cares to interact with mortals, tending first and foremost to its ward, a kaminari may entertain the idea of interacting with a fellow virtuoso. Kaminaris thus have a great affection for bards who practice an instrument, and will occasionally interrupt their diligent guardianship of their storm if doing so allows them the opportunity to play with a skillful accompanist. Amateurs need not apply, as the immortal kaminaris are often among the best players of their instruments, commanding powers of music so stirring that even the most talented bard might have trouble keeping up.",

			"A kaminari goes to great lengths to surround itself with booming noise, and is rarely seen without its instrument of choice. While most kaminaris prefer to use drums and other percussion instruments to fill the air around them with sound, rare individuals also adhere to the use of keyboard, string, and wind instruments. The powers of these kaminaris do not greatly differ, but their choice of instrument is usually a fair indicator of their temperament as well as the kind of storm they travel upon-those who play keyboards are usually found amid desert-quenching storms that wander arid environments, bringing with them the power of tornadoes and dust storms; players of string instruments tend toward oceanic environs, residing within the hearts of devastating hurricanes of incredible magnitude far out at sea; and kaminaris who use wind instruments occupy blizzards, commanding the powers of the ice and snow that constantly whip about them."

			"#### Description",
			"",
			"Revered by druids and rangers for their attunement with the wilds, kodama, known also as tree kami, are the guardians of the wild trees of the forest-they do not protect trees cultivated and grown in civilized areas. (Those trees are protected by different kami, if at all.) A kodama takes a single tree under its protection; typically, all of the trees in a forest that are protected by kodama are clustered together in one particular area.",
			"",
			"A kodama in its physical form resembles a barely humanoid creature with only the vaguest of features on its semi-spherical head. A tree kami is 3 feet tall and weighs 60 pounds. While one might expect the kami of something as large as a tree to itself be larger, the fact that forests are made up of so many trees tends to diminish the singular \"presence\" any single tree might have. In cases where a tree is particularly ancient or immense, however, the kodama associated with it is much larger-statistics for such rare kodama can be generated by advancing the kodama given here by several Hit Dice and increasing its size-theoretically, a Colossal kodama with more than 20 Hit Dice could exist somewhere in the world. Not all kodama increase in power by gaining racial Hit Dice, though, as some instead progress by gaining class levels, particularly levels of druid, though a rare few kodama kami-those possessed of minds more ordered and structured than is normal for their race-take the path of the monk.",
			"",
			"Kodama are more curious about visitors than most kami, and often manifest their physical bodies simply to watch and observe newcomers to their groves. A kodama usually manifests on the far side of its tree, or in the shadows of the undergrowth, so that it can slowly step out into visibility to quietly observe with its distracting, empty-eyed gaze. This gaze can be particularly unnerving. Those who have fallen under its supernatural effects often have different descriptions of how the gaze made them feel (ashamed, frightened, curious, amused, and nervous being the most common reactions), yet the end result is essentially the same. While under observation by a curious kodama, few are those who can continue their actions without being at least somewhat distracted by the kami's attention.",
			"",
			"When a kodama must fight (typically in order to defend its tree or other kami), it moves quickly-kodama work best in groups, and when confronted alone generally use tree stride to travel to another part of the forest to raise a small host of allies to aid it in defending its home.",
