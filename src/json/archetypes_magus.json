Many battlemages focus purely on destructive evocations, but some extend their tactical studies to include use of the tried-and-true protection of steel. These armored battlemages learn to move and cast spells in even the most restrictive armors, and have developed new methods to magically enhance their armor. Most armored battlemages strongly support the Arclords of Nex. Many travel beyond their homelands seeking some method of contacting the archmage Nex, and hope for some excuse to convince the Council of Three and Nine to renew hostilities with the nation of Geb.",

Sometimes it just appears among the magus's possessions, and its origin is a mystery. Other times the magus finds a black blade during an adventure or event of some kind. Sometimes a black blade is passed down generation to generation in an ongoing search for a magus who can unlock its true potential. A black blade is always a one-handed slashing weapon, a rapier, or a sword cane. The magus chooses the blade's type upon gaining the blade, and once chosen, it can't be changed. As a bladebound magus increases in level, his black blade gains power. A black blade is independently conscious but features some personality traits reflecting its wielder. A black blade always has the same alignment as its wielder and even changes its alignment if its wielder does. The blade typically works toward its wielder's goals, but not always without argument or backlash. Each black blade has a mission, and while sometimes two or more black blades will work in concert, each mission is singular in purpose (the black blade's mission is usually up to the GM and the needs of the campaign or the adventure, or a GM can roll randomly for the weapon's purpose using the Intelligent Item Purpose table. Some black blades are very open about their missions, but most are secretive. Certain sages have speculated that an invisible hand or arcane purpose moves these weapons.",

			"**Spell Traps (Sp):** At 4th level, a spell trapper learns how to craft magical traps in exchange for the use of spell slots. These traps work as {ability/ranger traps}, except they always count as spell-like abilities. A spell trap is always considered magical, and is treated as a spell with a spell level equal to 1/3 the spell trapper's class level. A magical trap lasts only 1 hour per level or until triggered, whichever comes first. A trap's DC decreases by 1 for each full hour that passes after it is set. Upon gaining this ability, the spell trapper automatically knows the snare trap.",

			"Setting a spell trap is a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity. If attacked during the course of conjuring a trap, the spell trapper must attempt a concentration check, as though damaged while casting a spell. A trap fills a single 5-foot square, and cannot be placed in the same area as another spell trapper trap or a magical trap such as a glyph of warding. Spell trappers need access to a material component pouch to craft spell traps (unless they have the Eschew Materials feat) and must sacrifice a spell slot to create the trap. The DCs for Perception checks to notice the trap, Disable Device checks to disable it, and saving throws to avoid it are equal to 10 + 1/2 the spell trapper's magus level + the spell slot level sacrificed to create the trap. All spell traps are Trigger location, and Reset none.",

The athame lasts for 1 minute or until dismissed, has an enhancement bonus on attack and damage rolls equal to the level of the spell sacrificed (maximum +5), and is considered a weapon the spellblade is holding for purposes of his arcane pool feature (using the pool to add abilities to a held weapon applies to the magus's physical weapon and to the athame for no additional cost). The athame acts as a dagger, but the hand holding it is still considered free for the purpose of casting spells and delivering touch attacks. The magus can use the athame as if he were fighting with two weapons, or can use that hand to cast spells as part of the spell combat class ability (but not both in the same round).

If the athame misses, it returns automatically to the magus' hand just before his next turn.

As a result, they eschew armor entirely.

The spire defender does not have the magus' ability to ignore arcane spell failure from armor; however, if the spire defender becomes proficient in light armor, he automatically gains the magus's ability to ignore the arcane spell failure chance of light armor. If he becomes proficient in medium armor, at 7th level he ignores medium armor's chance of arcane spell failure.
