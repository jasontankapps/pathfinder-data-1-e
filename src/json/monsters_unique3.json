			"Abadar's herald is the Lawgiver, a golem-like creature of gold and consecrated steel. Massive and powerful, the divine emissary appears as a giant in elaborate golden armor bearing a titanic warhammer. Standing still, the Lawgiver seems to be a fantastic statue crafted in honor of the god of law. When it's active, its steps shake the earth and the blows of its legendary hammer-the god-forged Gavel of Abadar-can shatter castle walls. Stoic, infinitely patient, and entirely dedicated to the Keeper of the First Vault, the Lawgiver is righteous, relentless in its cause, and capable of exacting incredible destruction. This sentinel of civilization appears where the forces of chaos threaten to undo the works of lawful communities and hinder the inexorable march of progress.",
			"",

			"",
			"Over the past century, followers of Abadar have reported seeing the Lawgiver wandering in remote places, from ancient caves to underwater trenches, seemingly searching for something. These travels have lead to widespread conjecture and debate among the faithful.",

			"",
			"- Immunity to charm and compulsion effects, death effects, fire, and poison.",
			"- Resistance to acid 30 and cold 30.",
			"- Telepathy 300 feet.",
			"- Lorthact's natural weapons, as well as any weapon he wields, are treated as evil and lawful for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.",
			"- Lorthact can grant spells to his worshipers. Granting spells does not require any specific action on his behalf. Lorthact grants access to the domains of Evil, Law, Magic, and Trickery. His favored weapon is the quarterstaff.",
			"",
			"**Intelligence Drain (Su)** Lorthact drains 1 point of Intelligence each time he hits with a weapon or natural weapon (Will DC 39 negates). Alternatively, he can make a single melee touch attack per round, dealing no hit point damage but draining 2d4 points of Intelligence (Will DC 39 half). After draining Intelligence from a creature, Lorthact gains the benefit of foresight (as the spell) against that creature for 1 minute.",
			"",
			"**Scholastic Masquerade (Su)** When targeting a dominated wizard with his spell reservoir ability, Lorthact can also steal a school power from that wizard's chosen school. He can steal one of the wizard's 1st-level school powers by using three levels of his spell reservoir, both 1st-level school powers at a cost of six levels, and all school powers at a cost of nine levels. While Lorthact retains these powers, the target wizard cannot use them. The stolen powers function at the target wizard's level. Lorthact can steal school powers or a prepared spell from a dominated wizard, but not both. He may steal school powers from multiple schools if he has multiple wizards dominated.",
			"",
			"**Spell Reservoir (Su)** Lorthact can drain prepared arcane spells from the mind of a creature he has dominated and store them for later use, similarly to a ring of spell storing. Draining a spell requires 1 full-round action if he is able to touch the target, or 1 minute to perform through the mental link provided by the dominate effect; in either case, no saving throw is allowed. He can hold no more than one stolen spell from each dominated caster in his spell reservoir, and the total level of stolen spells cannot exceed 25. These stolen spells take effect at the original caster's level.",
			"",
			"**Temporal Anomaly (Su)** Lorthact exists slightly outside of the normal timestream. Spells that predict the future-such as augury, divination, foresight, and moment of prescience- cannot perceive him and provide no benefit against him or information about him. In addition, whenever a creature within 60 feet of him uses time stop, Lorthact can act normally within the duration of the time stop, as if he had cast it himself. As neither Lorthact nor the caster are frozen in time with respect to each other, each can target and affect the other with attacks, spells, or other effects they create, though they cannot affect other creatures within the duration of the time stop. This ability functions even if Lorthact is flat-footed or unaware of his opponent.",
			"",
			"#### Description",
			"",
			"Lorthact the Unraveler, also named the Dwimmerlaik, the Ur-Magius, and the Diabolus Mystere, was once a high-ranking duke of Hell. Atypically, he was not solely bound to the service of a single archdevil, instead serving openly at various times as a mystical advisor and consultant on magical matters under both Geryon and Mephistopheles. Some believed him to be secretly a favorite of Asmodeus himself; this supposed favor provided some measure of protection from his jealous rivals. His last mistress in Hell was Eiseth, Whore-Queen of the erinyes, but when Eiseth uncovered a plot to reverse their positions-Lorthact arrogating himself to lordship and reducing her to mere consort-her wrath was enormous and eternal. Lorthact's allies deserted him lest they taste the fury of the erinyes. Lorthact proclaimed his innocence, but he saw condemnation awaiting and fled, racing across the planes with the whips of the erinyes at his heels.",
			"",
			"After several planar refuges proved no shelter from his relentless pursuers, Lorthact sought solace in the mortal realms. Laying several false leads, he then doubled back to the diabolists of Cheliax, the first place his pursuers looked for him on Golarion. But after they had moved on, he slipped back into places they thought already thoroughly scoured. Adopting a succession of guises, he kept his presence hidden for years, but he never felt truly comfortable under the gaze of so many potentially unfriendly eyes. Seeking a more remote locale, he traveled to the farthest reaches of Chelish sovereignty: the Varisian city-state of Korvosa. There he found the perfect patsy in the vain and corrupt Lord Volshyenek Ornelos. Rebuffed by House Thrune in his quest to restore his youth and vigor, Volshyenek was easy prey for Lorthact's inveigling. The devil bound him in a web of lies and stole not only his soul but also his life. Impersonating Lord Ornelos for over 200 years, he became a dominant figure in Korvosa, shadow-master of the Acadamae and sire of a great house. Meanwhile, he sought ways to rebuild his diabolic power and his store of souls so one day he might buy his way back to ducal favor in Hell.",
			"",
			"In the end, Eiseth's diabolic assassins found him at long last, and he was forced to fake his own death. Yet he still dominates Korvosa from the shadows, controlling the Acadamae through his descendant Toff Ornelos. Little happens in the city without his knowledge, and he plays the part of the mage through shadow-magic, illusions, limited wishes, and the stolen magic of others. However, casters who delve too deeply into his or Korvosa's secrets find themselves at odds with the deadly duke, his powers honed by centuries of exile to undermine and destroy mages who might uncover his identity or unravel his schemes."

			"Malsandra traveled farther from her mother's stream in the Lands of the Linnorm Kings than any of her sisters when looking for a body of water to call her own, just under a century ago. She followed the stream to the Rimeflow River and from there to the Steaming Sea, where the open water felt new and exciting to her. Once in the ocean, Malsandra swam south along the coastline for many months, never settling and continuing ever toward warmer waters. Nearly a year after setting out on her own, she finally found a marshy estuary where the godless land of Rahadoum meets the Sodden Lands, well within the immediate influence of the newly formed permanent hurricane known as the Eye of Abendego.",
			"",
			"There she inhabited a long-abandoned temple to a forgotten god-all holy symbols and iconography shorn from its walls after the Oath Wars drew to a close- submerged in the center of an ever-growing swamp. The Rahadoumi villagers of the nearby fishing settlement of Mekhum, still coping with drastic shifts in climate as a result of the Eye of Abendego's advent, believed her to be a drowned victim of the increasingly dangerous wetlands. Lacking clerics to exorcise the ghost from the abandoned temple, the people of Mekhum had little choice but to acquiesce to Malsandra's demands, and to this day, they pay her tribute each year on the anniversary of her arrival (a date they believe to have been when she died).",
			"",
			"Malsandra prefers to keep as pets a combination of wayward sailors who find their way into her marshy seaside realm and powerful swamp monsters, which have grown ever more prevalent since the Eye of Abendego has taken hold in the region. From time to time, locals even report seeing the temple ghost with a small black dragon, though these may be simple rumors."

In the past thousand years, the rune giants of Malziarax's people have managed to dominate many of the giants in this relatively new region- including the frost giants of the Tian side of the Crown of the World and several of the mysterious wood giants of the Forest of Spirits. In recent years, however, Malziarax found the icy and often barren realms of the Wall of Heaven not to her liking, and so she set out to reclaim the empires of her ancestors, leading a band of loyal followers back across the Crown of the World to northern Irrisen.",

Though her ancestors gave up on the wild frontier of Varisia and its surrounding lands, Malziarax claims to see the land for its true potential, and knows that somewhere in these vast mountains lie great stores of treasure for the taking and giants for the enslaving."

He was as close as you could get among the Academy's professors to a celebrity. His lectures on anatomy in particular were always standing-room only events that drew far beyond the walls of the Academy itself for audience members. Charming, handsome, and as the Kintargo gossips were so fond of pointing out, quite available, Mangvhune maintained the public facade of the perfect gentleman scholar.",

When Mangvhune was revealed to be the notorious Temple Hill Slasher, a brutal serial killer who tormented his victims for days before leaving their mutilated bodies in the vicinity of Temple Hill, the city was stunned. Despite a swift trial and even swifter execution by headsman's axe, the Alabaster Academy's reputation never fully recovered from the scandalous revelation. Mangvhune's murderous soul went swiftly to the Abyss after his death, where he transformed into a babau demon, mind and personality intact. Since then, Mangvhune's notoriety has only grown, and rumors that the Temple Hill Slasher now stalks the streets of dozens of cities throughout the Inner Sea region persist-particularly in Kintargo during the week surrounding the anniversary of his execution so many years ago.",
			"",
			"The Temple Hill Slasher prefers to face solitary foes, striking swiftly with a sneak attack if possible to set the victim to bleeding and then holding back, hiding in the cover of darkness and watching until the victim dies or recovers from the bleed damage, at which point he slips in again to start the process anew. The babau isn't afraid to teleport to a nearby hiding place if a foe seems to be particularly strong-he merely hides again and then bides his time for another strike when he can. Mangvhune prefers to use his death attack to paralyze foes rather than kill them outright, affording him a chance to torment the victim telepathically for several rounds before he delivers a coup de grace. The babau prefers to avoid fighting larger groups on his own, but when he must, he abandons his sneak attacks in favor of full-attack actions, focusing on healers first. He saves his angel of death ability for particularly hated foes. Mangvhune delights in gathering the dust remaining after such a kill, and keeps an ever-growing collection of painstakingly-labeled vials of these ashen mortal remains in his Abyssal lair.",
			"",
			"This den is called Razorspan, a bridge-like palace built from blades and knives that straddles a deep rift filled with bones near the realm of Shax itself, on a winding route that leads away from the realm of the demon lord of murder into the wilds of unclaimed Abyssal worlds. The ceilings, walls, and floors of Razorspan are riddled with cutting edges, blades that make exploration of the structure a constant battle against a thousand cuts. The blades themselves are incapable of penetrating Mangvhune's damage reduction (or that of most of his minions, for that matter), but are an impossible to ignore hazard for would-be explorers of the notorious structure.",
			"",
			"Mangvhune does not require any additional offering when conjured, but does require that any service he provides to a conjurer includes an equal amount of time allowed in the conjurer's region to stalk new victims of the babau assassin's choice. Wise conjurers take pains to protect themselves from Mangvhune's additional attentions once his services have been carried out. It's a DC 26 check to research the Temple Hill Slasher."

His father, Huratektor, was the ruling tyrant of their tribe, and had recently relocated the tribe to the Bandu Hills, where the mountainous landscape proved more easily defendable than their previous lair within the Kaava Lands. When Huratektor's most outspoken rival-a warrior of low status by the name of Nukamman-assassinated the tyrant, he sparked a civil conflict within the tribe that irreparably split its people into two groups, with Nukamman and his fellow dissenters fleeing further into the mountains, where he was crowned tyrant of his newly created splinter tribe. In the chaos of the conflict, Nukamman managed to abduct baby Mardatektor, renaming him Mardahamman and raising him as his own.",
			"",
			"In the decades that followed, the rift between the Huratektor's old tribe and Nukamman's traitors never healed, and skirmishes broke out frequently between the two tribes. When Mardahamman came of age and brandished a greatclub for the first time, his adoptive father brought the youth with him on the final raid against their rival tribe. When Mardahamman experienced the taste of battle for this first time, unknowingly laying waste to his own people, he knew something was amiss, a notion confirmed when he confronted Nukamman about it later.",
			"",
			"Shamed by his own actions and angry at the betrayal of the tyrant he had thought to be his father, Mardahamman fled from the hills and into the Kaava Lands, not knowing that his people originally hailed from there decades earlier. In that forest, he met a small conclave of cyclops warriors who had stayed behind when Huratektor took his tribe to the Bandu Hills. Feeling that these rebels would be the closest he'd ever have to a real family again, Mardahamman joined their conclave and trained to become an expert warrior, eventually coming to lead the cyclopes of the Kaava Lands as their tyrant, all in hopes of one day exacting revenge on his treacherous adoptive father, Nukamman."

			"Moxix, the Drinker of Human Hopes, is a unique demon bound to the mysterious isle called Yoha's Graveyard in the Shackles. Appearing as an eldritch four-armed statue of weathered gray stone, Moxix has a single emerald eye centered in his horrible face. A nest of twisted horns rests atop his head, and his fang-filled maw is perpetually stained with blood. Those courageous explorers traveling to his seemingly idyllic isle are driven mad by strange visions and dreams, or by inscrutable but disturbing carvings, idols, and glyphs that litter the island. Even if they withstand the island's maddening magic, adventurers in search of legendary lost riches may confront Moxix himself and be scourged of mind, body, and soul. Moxix's baleful presence and malevolent awareness leer from every crudely carved icon, relief, and idol bearing his likeness, bringing with them a tinge of insanity and a ravenous hunger for human flesh. Ghosts and pentagram-branded cannibals and lunatics are all that remain of ill-fated expeditions to Yoha's Graveyard.",
			"",
			"Moxix found his first worshipers among the terrible cyclopes of Ghol-Gan as their civilization fell into ruin. As the one-eyed giants slipped more and more into depravity and violence, they began worshiping foul, otherworldly creatures their brothers and sisters brought up from the vaults of the Darklands after their exposure to the serpentfolk's wicked ways. Among the dozens of fiendish icons was Moxix, who came into influence among the cyclopes as their practice of sacrifice and cannibalism increased. It was at this time Moxix became known as the Drinker of Human Hopes. The ancient Ghol-Gan cyclopes fed him hundreds of captured humans, most of whom were of Azlanti descent. In one instance early in his time among the Ghol-Gan cyclopes, Moxix's followers captured an entire Azlanti embassy and fed them to the strange demon one by one while their companions watched in horror. Some say the sacrifices' spirits still inhabit the region, their wailing cries drifting through the hills and jungles of the haunted island.",
			"",
			"As his reign of blood began to spread from its base in southern Ghol-Gan, a raging contingent of rival cyclopes from elsewhere in the failing empire raided the demon-worshiping clan dedicated to Moxix, bringing both brute strength and the magic of powerful shamans and oracles to bear against it. The battle raged for 2 days, and in the end an oracle sacrificed her life in a final ploy to destroy Moxix. However, the oracle only succeeded in binding him to the high mountain peak that would one day become the island known as Yoha's Graveyard.",
			"",
			"To this very day, Moxix remains trapped in his island domain, ever eager to draw creatures to the ziggurat he calls home. There he delights in turning people to cannibalism, destruction, and insanity. Obscuring and disease-laden mists swirl around the island, keeping its lands hidden and protected from trespassers. Once per year, however, on the first full moon after the rainy season, the mists part for a single night. Some explorers have mounted expeditions to Moxix's island during these events, but as of yet, no one has returned the same person she used to be; all bear the mark of insanity Moxix stamps on their being."

			"Even today, centuries after his 13th and final execution, memories of Riktus Scroon continue to haunt the nightmares of those who live along the northern coastlines of the Inner Sea. During his reign of horror, the man who would come to be known as the Nightripper used his position in the now disbanded Graven Guard of Taldor to move along the shipping lanes with ease. His position among the mercenary company afforded him time in countless settlements from Golisfar to Corentyn, and in these unsuspecting towns he hunted. Scroon preferred young victims, that their vanishing would cause the most distress possible-his favorites were young adults freshly in love, although he seemed to have had no preference between man or woman. He abducted his victims with astonishing skill, tormenting them for hours with his blades before leaving them broken and bleeding to death at the bottom of a specially prepared pit far outside of town. The mass murderer was finally captured by Cesandra Dayne, an obsessed priest of Sarenrae who had lost her fiancee and her father to Scroon. Only by forsaking the teachings of her church was she able to trap the murderer in the slums of Almas, and although the resulting fight saw the death of a dozen innocent bystanders, in the end Cesandra had her man alive.",
			"",
			"After Scroon was turned over to the law in his hometown of Oppara, the authorities thought to prosecute him for the deaths of no fewer than 46 known victims. When Scroon gleefully bragged of having murdered nearly a thousand men, women, and children, the authorities were eager to write off his ravings, yet after Scroon provided exacting details to the sites of 953 victims, and one after the other his directions led to actual graves, the killer's sentencing was hastened-death by hanging. Yet Scroon survived. One after the other, attempts to execute the Nightripper failed-headsmen died of fright as they lifted the axe, guillotines malfunctioned, magic failed. Each botched execution left Scroon more disfigured, but his legend grew. The 13th and final execution put the man down once and for all-or so it was hoped.",
			"",
			"Scroon's soul went to the Boneyard, where something amazing happened-he passed through to the Abyss with his mind and memories intact. So remarkable was his retention of his identity that it drew the attention of Lamashtu herself, who pulled the killer's soul from the shuddersome bosom of the Abyss and made him her personal assassin, raising him from a broken shell of a soul to a nascent demon lord with greater power than he'd ever hoped for in life. His form had changed, transforming into a shape more befitting one of his horrific nature, yet his mind remained sharp and clear. Nightripper harbors a strong desire for revenge, but for now he serves dutifully as Lamashtu's favored torturer and assassin and as the lord of the dungeons below her palace in the Abyssal realm of Kurnugia. But it is said that someday, when he has repaid his debt to the Mother of Demons for his ascension and rescue from the dregs of the Abyss, the Nightripper will return to his old haunts. Only this time, it will not be individuals he breaks and bleeds and buries in his pits-it will be entire cities."

Depending on the herald's progress, these markings may resemble elaborate constellations and star shapes, swift blowing winds and clouds, or even harsh streaks of falling meteorites. Sighting the Night Monarch is thought to bring good luck and favorable dreams, which many hold to be visions from the goddess herself. The Herald of Desna's head rises 14 feet off the ground, and its body is about 30 feet long. It weighs approximately 2,000 pounds."

			"#### Description",

			"No character looms larger in the myths of the Mwangi tribes than Old-Mage Jatembe. Jatembe rose to prominence in the Age of Anguish, a time when mankind was just beginning to recover from the devastation caused by Earthfall and the destruction of Azlant. Jatembe was the first among humanity to rediscover the art of wizardry and written magic, and did much to redeem these arts in the eyes of a superstitious people. Jatmebe worked tirelessly to stem the tide of barbarism left in the wake of the Age of Darkness, and preserve the learning and culture of his people. He is remembered as a folk hero among the Mwangi, and as a beacon of hope in a darkest of times.",
			"",
			"Little is known about Jatembe's origins. Even in the earliest of myths, he's described as an old man. Some scholars point out parallels between Jatembe's ageless nature and the immortal masters of the lost city of Ird, suggesting that fabled city as his birthplace, though the decadent and cruel lords of Ird have little else in common with him. Later accounts claim Jatembe and his disciples destroyed the city of Ird to punish it for its wickedness, casting doubt on this theory. Other myths connect Jatembe with the druids of the Mwangi Expanse, some even claiming he was an ex-druid himself. True or not, Jatembe did have an affinity for druidic magic, and the magical school he founded-the Magaambya-continues to teach druid spells to this day.",
			"",
			"The details of Jatembe's ascension are similarly occluded by millennia of myth and legend. One popular tale holds that Jatembe learned the deepest mysteries of magic from the severed head of Ydersius before sewing the serpent-god's lips shut. Others claim he gained mythic knowledge from sources among the planes, for many tales tell of his dealings with angels, demons, and other outsiders while in search of ways to protect his people. Still more stories say that Jatembe found some potent artifact amid the ruins of the Mwangi that awakened his mythic potential, and that he departed Golarion once the strength of this artifact had faded.",
			"",
			"Prior to his mysterious departure, Jatembe performed many astonishing deeds. The first of these was the gathering of his disciples, the Ten Magic Warriors. These men and women were known only by the golden animal masks they wore, having forsaken their identities in service to Jatembe and his quest. With their help, Jatembe explored the ancient ruins that dot the Mwangi Expanse, uncovering ancient magical secrets and treasures. He founded the city of Nantambu and the Magaambya arcane academy to preserve and share knowledge and wealth with future generations, and to protect the Expanse from further devastation such as that wrought by the Earthfall. In later days, Jatembe fought and defeated the twisted sorcerer known as the King of Biting Ants, who claimed to possess a weapon that would allow him to eat the sun and cast the world into darkness.",
			"",
			"For reasons unknown, Jatembe departed Golarion; if anyone knows where he left to, they're silent on the matter. Some believe he left to fulfill obligations to the beings who granted him mythic power, and others think a magnificent spell took him. He left his Ten Magic Warriors behind to rule in his place, and forged the Ring of Nine Facets to aid them in his absence. He has created and used other artifacts in his travels, but gave them all away to allies, keeping only the beacon of true faith that one of his patrons gave him."

The Oliphaunt can prevent a gate or similar effect from opening inside Jandelay's borders unless the effect was created by an artifact or cast by a mythic character. If brought outside Jandelay, the Oliphaunt attempts a Will saving throw each day to return. The DC is equal to the DC of the spell that transported it, or the DC that spell would have if it allowed a saving throw. The return of the Oliphaunt triggers a magical punishment on those that stole it, laying waste to people and land. Centered on the point from which the Oliphaunt just departed, the ward triggers a mass hold monster spell targeting all creatures in a 5-mile radius. Then, that area is affected by an earthquake and storm of vengeance that last 1d12 months. While in Jandelay, the Oliphaunt's dimensional lock aura extends to protect the entire realm.",

			"Only once did the Oliphaunt of Jandelay set foot on Golarion. A runelord of Thassilon, a precursor of Karzoug, had the knowledge to call the creature, and the ambition and ego to do so despite the risks. He erected the Spindlehorn, a slender tower of dark slate thousands of feet tall, in the Wyvern Mountains simply so he could look the Oliphaunt in the eye and attempt to control it. And control it he did.",
			"",
			"The Oliphaunt caused the carnage the runelord intended, destroying an invading army from Azlant. Black clouds sprang from a clear sky around the mountain of a creature, and lightning and hail shot down on the amassed troops. Every impact of the thing's foot shook the ground, and the thunder of the Oliphaunt's march through the armies drowned out even the screams of the dying thousands. A massive valley marked the path where the Oliphaunt trod, with entire cities lying buried underneath the earth by the crushing footfalls.",
			"",
			"But even a runelord couldn't control such power forever, and the wards protecting the Oliphaunt continued to draw it back to its home realm of Jandelay. The legion following the runelord's ally, Runelord Xanderghul, suffered the parting punishment when the Oliphaunt vanished, torn back to Jandelay. A quarter of Xanderghul's legion froze still in their tracks, then were ripped apart by chaotic, bloody storms and repeated earthquakes left in the Oliphaunt's wake.",
			"",
			"In spite of the repercussions of calling the Oliphaunt of Jandelay, spellcasters of great influence and arrogance still attempt to recreate the singular feat of calling it to Golarion. Desperation drives most who try, most notably the Runelord Alaznist, who was prepared to call the beast down upon Karzoug as he prepared to finally march on her territory. Only Earthfall cut Alaznist's plans short.",
			"",
			"Since the fall of the runelords and Thassilon, lore about the Oliphaunt and Jandelay has become much harder to come by-but it's far from forgotten. Ancient liches still work away in secluded laboratories to recreate the complicated means that once before called forth the great Oliphaunt, meticulously reconstructing what few scraps of ancient records they can find. Speculators collect all sorts of relics purported to be chunks of tusk that sloughed off the beast, vials of water collected from lakes formed by the Oliphaunt's tears, and all manner of other curiosities. Few eyewitness accounts remain, since most who saw the Oliphaunt died.",
			"",
			"Few alive on Golarion even know about the Oliphaunt, but even fewer understand what Jandelay itself is. Some believe it's the name of the person who first scribed a tale of the Oliphaunt, others think it's an even greater progenitor beast that spawned the creature. Those who've deeply researched to topic found only a few hints. The most compelling of these are within the epic poem Jandelay, as inscribed at the base of the Spindlehorn. The poem tells of the Oliphaunt's rampage and the other legendary acts of the runelord who summoned it (though lacking specific details of how the runelord pulled off this feat). However, within the poem is a cipher that when translated reveals these words:",

			"The grotesque marsh giant known as Oozlosh is the high priest of a large tribe in Varisia's Mushfens. His reputation has spread throughout the entire wetlands, and he regards himself as the unofficial ruler of all marsh giants in that wild region. He earned notoriety by bringing many goblins in southern Varisia under his heel and establishing relations with the swamp's boggards. Little occurs among the marsh giants of the Mushfens that the high priest does not command (or at least tolerate).",
			"",
			"The Mushfens are bordered on the south by Conqueror's Bay, forming a long coastline where the brutes practice their frightening rituals to Dagon. They are visited often by the demon lord's sea-spawn, resulting in many births of deformed brineborn. One of Dagon's horrific emissaries stays with Oozlosh's tribe occasionally, reveling in the giants' vulgar devotion. It has tasked Oozlosh with safeguarding the tribe's brineborn until they are called to fulfill a dark purpose, a secret the high priest guards with his life.",
			"",
			"Oozlosh's zealotry for Dagon knows no bounds. He debases himself physically to honor the demon lord and expects his followers to do the same. The high priest's swamp hovel is not grand, but in the muck around his shack, he secretly conceals prizes scavenged from the tribe's victims. Oozlosh also keeps a cage of shocker lizards outside his home, having become addicted to the jolts he receives when chewing the creatures."

Dedicated to the ideals of altruism, they raised her with lessons of the good in all creatures beneath Ioz'om's skies, and taught her all she'd need to know as a future leader and nurturer. Her innate gifts with wind and air emerged at a young age, but with them came the first hints of a darker fate. When the initial signs of her oracular curse made themselves apparent, many of her fellow tribespeople thought her to be plagued by some great evil. The merest hint of danger was enough to send the skittish child into a frenzy of words and phrases that she had no way of learning. With the pain of rejection first came bashfulness, which slowly evolved into utter hatred. Turning her back on her tribe, she abandoned her parents' cause to gather her own legion of followers among the evil cloud giants. She only returned once, nearly a century after leaving, to burn her home to the ground, torching the citadel and all the benevolent cloud giants within, including her parents.",
			"",
			"Now an adult in the fullness of her power, Orania no longer has to fight her own battles, instead sending her minions into combat for her, minions who see her frightful curse of tongues not as a hindrance, but as a god-given gift. Along with her army of cloud giant and mihstu servants, she has traveled along the western side of the Shattered Range for years in search of the fabled floating cloud giant city that lies somewhere within the rocky crags. She has been obsessed with the idea of floating cloud giant castles since she was a child, and sees in these mythic sky towers the means to forever rid herself of her curse. Through her pawns and other agents, she pursues any rumor of a city's discovery, extracting information with torture when lavish gifts won't suffice."

Locals in the area refer to the sasquatch by nicknames such as \"Old Limpy,\" but the Shoanti call the honored being Paakis-si.",

The scar that runs across his face and the soul-piercing gaze of his cerulean eyes lends evidence to the Shoanti's fables, and those who encounter the legendary sasquatch know he is no ordinary member of his elusive species. The magical tree branch he wields as a deadly club lends further evidence to such claims, and many believe the ancient being found his weapon at the same time he received his characteristic scar.",
			"",
			"Those who have caught a glimpse of Paakis-si report that the sasquatch appears extremely healthy and vital for a semi-centennial, and whether he is actually a thousand-year-old nature spirit or just an unusually long-lived and wise sasquatch is left up to debate. Travelers passing near to or through the Churlwood often consider it a lucky omen to spot Paakis-si's signature footprints."

			"",
			"Elders remember tales of Papa Chupar as far as 30 years back, an unusually long time for a chupacabra to live. Some tell a folk tale about a lazy, greedy youth who preferred begging off his neighbors rather than working for an honest living. One day, the youth reluctantly agreed to herd goats in exchange for food when no one would give him a meal for free. Rather than drive the goats to the pasture, the youth let them graze in a nearby graveyard. Outraged at this insolent act, the spirits of the buried ancestors cursed the youth. He took the form of a chupacabra, doomed to forever prey on animals for sustenance, shunned and feared by his former neighbors. The locals say that only death will free the boy's spirit, but Papa Chupar is far too quick and clever to be easily slain.",
			"",
			"Those who have spotted Papa Chupar describe a creature almost 7 feet from nose to tail, standing 5-1/2 feet tall. Gray-green hide thicker than an ordinary chupacabra's seems to draw shadows around it, and two leathery, scaled wings stretch out from the beast's spine. Papa Chupar's eyes glow crimson, and his talons and spines are a deep burgundy. The hilly terrain affords cover that Papa Chupar takes full advantage of.",
			"",
			"Unlike most chupacabras, Papa Chupar is willing to attack adult humanoids and often targets lone travelers, or even travelers in pairs. The chupacabra is particularly clever and vicious, and studies prey for at least an hour before striking. If possible, Papa Chupar prefers to sneak into camps at night and drain blood from sleeping victims. Though a victim's panicked screams wake the whole camp, Papa Chupar easily takes to the sky, invigorated, and flies off. If a watch is set, Papa Chupar has learned to flush small animals from their nests to create a distraction, hoping to lure the guard away and leave sleeping travelers vulnerable to his attack.",

			"Pyralisia, often called \"the Rain of Embers,\" was considered one the strongest and most benevolent phoenixes of Avistan in the early years of the Age of Lost Omens. She rose to prominence during the First Mendevian Crusade by leading the charge against a marilith general and her legion of minions. During the Second Crusade, Pyralisia oversaw the erection of several of the wardstones that kept the Worldwound's demonic hordes contained near the crusader citadel of Drezen. But when an Abyssal rift opened near the wardstone line before the final menhirs were in place, the entire crusade stood on the brink of failure. Without hesitation, Pyralisia threw her body into the yawning chasm, blocking the demons' escape and using her body to absorb the torrents of tainted fire bursting forth.",
			"",
			"Pyralisia's heroic act was not enough, however, and the dark energy pouring from the rift slew her quickly. When she resurrected from her ashes, the Abyssal flames bonded with Pyralisia and corrupted her, instilling her body with dark, negative energy and trapping the Rain of Embers in a body utterly consumed by evil.",
			"",
			"Now, Pyralisia prowls the Worldwound, hunting crusaders and demons alike in her vengeful anger. Phoenixes contend that if she could be killed, Pyralisia's self-resurrection would cleanse her of this malignancy and restore her true goodness. But so far, few have faced Pyralisia and lived to tell the tale. Those phoenixes that have tried to defeat her found themselves outmatched by the new power of Pyralisia's black fire, their own flames as useless against her as against any other of their kind. The phoenix Garidor-Pyralisia's mate prior to her corruption-anxiously watches the roads leading into Mendev, seeking powerful crusaders or adventurers to aid him in destroying his beloved before her perversion becomes permanent.",

Despite this relative youth, they still number among the oldest beings in creation, predating many archdevils, demon lords, empyreal lords, and even gods. Barzahk sees little new in this world, and a powerful boredom drives them to find wonder in small and personal things-the blooming of a flower, the rattle of a last breath, the tears of love that fall at a funeral. Whimsical and distracted, the usher rarely attends to their appointed duties for long and instead takes to wandering the planes to find new small wonders they can experience.",

Barzahk's awareness extends along the length and breadth of these extraplanar routes, and the usher can cast trespassers from their realm as easily as a dog shakes off water-and often with the same dispassion.",
			"",
			"Enigmatic and distracted, Barzahk seems to have trouble recognizing individual servants and worshippers. It is appropriate that the usher of lost travelers and vigils for missing things likewise seems so lost at all times. With their master prone to long wanderings, those psychopomps who serve under the Passage enjoy an unprecedented level of freedom in how they carry out their duties, with many even establishing their own small domains like more powerful outsiders.",
			"",
			"In addition to the usual army of attendant psychopomps, Barzahk commands a unique resource: the way stations and their masters that pin the Dead Roads in space and time. As such, Barzahk can call upon a strange menagerie of outsiders, fey, and experts for specialized tasks. While the various entities Barzahk appoints have no compulsion to obey the Passage, the usher can easily retract the authority they grant, denying these servants an isolated, secure home and relative power.",
			"",
			"Barzahk normally wanders the Dead Roads among the faceless flocks of ravens, jays, vultures, and whippoorwills that infest the Dead Roads, but they sometimes assume a larger, more humanoid form. In this form, they stand just over 5 feet tall and weigh 200 pounds."

They use a unique combination of feral combat and hardened discipline to ward off interplanar invaders as well as foes who would seek to hinder or distract their order. Instead of landing successive strikes with their fists, they rely on their deadly claws to inflict horrendous gashes that blaze with pain thanks to the supernaturally cold energy that infuses their blows. Those seeking to learn the secret techniques of the Qaishan are politely ushered away, and those who press their luck experience the swift and brutal wrath of the normally staid yetis."

This spray of boiling fluid strikes all creatures in a 60-foot burst centered on Chavazvug.

An affected creature takes a permanent -4 penalty on saving throws against fire effects and gains vulnerability to fire. All forms of fire resistance the creature benefits from function at half capacity (fire resistance 30 effectively functions as fire resistance 15, for example). All forms of immunity to fire that the creature has or later gains are suppressed, but in this case, the creature does not take any other penalty from this horrific appearance.

During this period, Chavazvug is technically alive, but immobile and unable to take any actions other than float in the lake. If this new body is slain before the 1d10 days required to completely regrow have passed, Chavazvug is slain forever (although it should be noted that these boiling lakes of bile are rife with dangerous qlippoth and other monstrosities that are quite capable of defending and protecting Chavazvug's body).

The creature takes a -4 penalty on saving throws against the spell-like abilities and supernatural attacks of all qlippoth (this penalty is permanent, but can be removed if the creature dies and is resurrected in some way other than via Chavazvug).

			"Chavazvug appears as a towering mound of greasy, slithering intestines and internal organs held aloft by five long, slender legs that taper to razor-sharp points. Twitching coils and ropes of entrails dangle below the shuddering bulk, and the entire thing steams and glows with heat. Known as the Crawling Inferno, the very touch of this immense qlippoth lord can set flesh alight and his presence can cause living creatures normally immune to fire to burn alive. Chavazvug stands 50 feet high and weighs 20,000 pounds.",
			"",
			"Unlike other qlippoth lords, Chavazvug has chosen to focus on battling demons themselves rather than the sinful souls that spawn them. This makes Chavazvug the least antagonistic of the known qlippoth lords to mortal worshipers, yet the qlippoth lord remains uncaring in the long term for the health and prosperity of \"lesser beings\" that worship him.",
			"",
			"Chavazvug's Abyssal sanctum is a vast, crater strewn wasteland in an immense underground cavern deep in the Abyss. Many of these craters are filled with bile and seepage, boiling hot lakes in which strange creatures roil and froth. New craters form constantly as portions of the ceiling miles above fall and plummet to impact the floor. In time, the constantly collapsing ceiling may well cause subsidence in other demonic realms far above, or even break through into the Astral Plane, at which point cultists of Chavazvug hold that their god will rise in power to become a deity.",
			"",
			"### Chavazug's Cult",
			"",
			"Chavazvug is known as the Crawling Inferno to his worshipers, who venerate the qlippoth lord as a patron of fiery consumption and monstrous recursion. For the typical worshiper of Chavazvug, nothing could be closer to perfection than perishing from an unexpected bout of spontaneous combustion, only to have some form of horrific monster spawn from the steaming ashes left behind by the supplicant's fiery doom. These worshipers believe such a fate is a reward for service, and never seek to trigger such combustion on their own. Worshipers of Chavazvug tend to be solitary lunatics, arsonists, and sadists who delight in burning helpless victims as much as they do in the choking scent of seared flesh or the hypnotic glow of a fiery conflagration consuming a building or woodland. Chavazvug's sacred sites are the burnt-out husks of buildings-particularly buildings where demonic worship once took place.",

			"**Destruction (Su)** Isph-Aun-Vuln's bite resolves as a primary touch attack. A creature bitten by the qlippoth lord must succeed at a DC 33 Fortitude save or take 1d6 points of Wisdom drain and 150 points of negative energy damage. If the creature successfully saves, it takes 1 point of Wisdom drain and 20d6 points of negative energy damage. If a creature is slain by this damage, its body is immediately consumed in unholy fire, leaving behind only its possessions. The only way to restore such a slain creature to life is via true resurrection, a carefully worded wish spell followed by resurrection, or miracle. This is a death effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.",
			"",
			"**Destructive Commands (Ex)** When Isph-Aun-Vuln magically controls a creature via a charm or compulsion effect, she may issue commands to the creature that are self-destructive or against the target's nature. When such a command is issued, the magically controlled creature can resist the command with a successful Will save against the DC of the spell effect in question, but success at this save does not cause the effect to end and does not prevent Isph-Aun-Vuln from attempting to issue the same or a similar command on a subsequent round.",
			"",
			"**Horrific Appearance (Su)** A creature that succumbs to Isph-Aun-Vuln's horrific appearance becomes convinced that it has already succumbed to the qlippoth lord's mental control and can take no action other than to approach. An affected creature gains freedom of movement and a fly speed of 60 feet (perfect maneuverability) that can be used only to approach Isph-Aun-Vuln. Once an affected creature is adjacent to Isph-Aun-Vuln, it becomes dazed as long as it remains adjacent to the qlippoth lord. This dazed affect ends as soon as the creature is no longer adjacent, at which point the compulsion to approach Isph-Aun-Vuln returns. If Isph-Aun-Vuln is not present, the creature is free to act normally, but as soon as Isph-Aun-Vuln reappears, the compulsion to approach returns as well. This is a mind-affecting compulsion and a curse effect. If not removed via magic, this curse ends only after the creature remains outside Isph-Aun-Vuln's presence for 24 consecutive hours.",
			"",
			"**Insidious Possession (Ex)** When Isph-Aun-Vuln tries to possess an object or creature via a spell-like ability, she automatically attempts to dispel any protection from evil or similar spell effect on the creature via greater dispel magic. In addition, once a creature fails a saving throw against Isph-Aun-Vuln's possession spell-like abilities, it takes a -4 penalty on all future saving throws against mind-affecting effects created by any qlippoth. This lingering penalty is a curse effect.",
			"",
			"**Reflect Compulsion (Ex)** Even though Isph-Aun-Vuln is immune to mind-affecting effects, when a creature targets her with a compulsion spell or spell-like ability and that effect fails to penetrate her spell resistance, that effect is reflected back upon the caster. Treat the compulsion spell or effect as if Isph-Aun-Vuln had been the caster, except that the save DC remains unchanged.",
			"",
			"**Soul Shell (Su)** Isph-Aun-Vuln is constantly surrounded by a swirling vortex of soul fragments from the countless creatures that have perished while she was dominating or possessing them. This vortex is a force effect that grants Isph-Aun-Vuln a +12 armor bonus and serves to deflect incoming ranged touch attacks. All ranged touch attacks against this qlippoth lord have a 50% miss chance. The soul shell does not impede Isph-Aun-Vuln's ability to move through solid objects as an incorporeal creature.",
			"",
			"**Toxic Storm (Su)** As a standard action once every 1d4 rounds, Isph-Aun-Vuln can create a blast of hurricane-strength wind around herself. This blast of wind blows either outward from the qlippoth lord to a radius of 120 feet or inward toward the qlippoth lord from a radius of 60 feet, as chosen by Isph-Aun-Vuln. The wind affects creatures as described for [hurricane force winds](rule/weather). The blast of wind lasts for 1 round. These winds are highly toxic, and all creatures exposed to the poisonous winds are affected by the following poison effect. The save DC for the poison effect is Constitution-based.",

			"Isph-Aun-Vuln appears as a human-sized mass of roiling tentacles arrayed around a large toothy maw. These tentacles slip in and out of reality, never fully existing as anything more than vapor, yet despite her immaterial form and relatively small size, she is among the most powerful of the qlippoth lords. Whereas others overwhelm their opponents through size and strength, Isph-Aun-Vuln opts for a more subversive and subtle approach, using possession and mental control of others to achieve her goal of slaughtering every creature with the capacity for sin-in other words, all free-willed mortals. Those she has no such use for she devours, adorning herself with fragments of their souls as vaporous, incandescent trophies-such will be the fate of all who remain should Isph-Aun-Vuln ever succeed at eliminating free will from the universe.",

			"Isph-Aun-Vuln is perhaps the most powerful of the qlippoth lords, so it should come as no surprise that her cult is the most widespread among mortals on hundreds of different worlds throughout the Material Plane. Many who pay homage to Isph-Aun-Vuln, who is often referred to only as the Feaster Within, do so without knowing fully what sort of entity they worship, and only follow the commands of a charismatic but insane cult leader. In many cases, such leaders have been dominated or otherwise mentally controlled by Isph-Aun-Vuln so often that they have lost all remnants of their previous personalities. Isph- Aun-Vuln's worshipers venerate her amid standing stones perched on the edges of towering cliffs or rugged, wind-scoured mountain tops, and sacrifices to the demigoddess generally involve using magic to hurl a victim into the sky, where it is buffeted by winds before being allowed to fall to the earth below, broken and ruined.",

The qlippoth she creates must be of a CR no greater than the slain creature's CR - 2, but otherwise the nature of the new qlippoth is chosen by Oaur-Ooung.

In addition to falling prone, the victim is dazed for 1d6 rounds. Each round the victim remains dazed, it takes 1d4 points of Constitution damage.

Unlike kaiju, which are similarly massive, Oaur-Ooung can make attacks of opportunity against foes of any size and can be flanked by foes of any size.

That they will retain none of their mortal memories or personalities is no deterrent to these people, as long as they survive in some form while the rest of their kind do not. Many have already abandoned their racial identities, repudiating their original cultures and pursuing magical or surgical alteration.

			"",
			"**Entangling Acid (Ex)** Any creature that takes acid damage from any of Thuskchoon's attacks or abilities (whether an extraordinary, supernatural, or spell-like ability) becomes entangled by the thick, sticky acid this qlippoth lord generates. Freedom of movement prevents this entangle effect; otherwise, it persists until a character peels off and discards the acidic sludge; doing so requires a successful DC 20 Strength check. Attempting to do so is a standard action that provokes attacks of opportunity.",
			"",
			"**False Intellect (Su)** In any round that Thuskchoon causes any Intelligence damage to a creature via his swallow whole ability, the qlippoth lord can use that digested intellect to gain the benefits of his intellectual flash ability for 1 round per point of Intelligence damage dealt in that round. This duration stacks if Thuskchoon has swallowed multiple creatures, or if the Intelligence damage continues for more than 1 round.",
			"",
			"**Horrific Appearance (Su)** A creature that succumbs to Thuskchoon's horrific appearance has its mind flooded with horrific recollections that may or may not be real, repressed terrors knocked loose and brought to the conscious mind by the presence of the monstrosity that is Thuskchoon. Often these memories are a strange mix of racial memory and flashes from past lives. The victim also experiences genetic reversions. The victim is immediately affected by feeblemind (as per the spell), and its body is deformed and hideously twisted. Select (or choose randomly) from the list of deformities gained from the [mutant template](template/mutant) to apply to the victim. Alternatively, simply reduce one of the victim's physical ability scores by 4 points (feel free to devise an appropriate cosmetic atrocity to add flavor to this reduction). The feeblemind effect can be cured normally by any effect that removes that condition (see the spell description for more details), but the mutation is permanent and can be removed only via a miracle or wish spell, or by death and subsequent resurrection. Thuskchoon's horrific appearance has no effect on creatures with an Intelligence score of 1 or 0.",
			"",
			"**Intellectual Flash (Ex)** When Thuskchoon enters combat, there's a cumulative 20% chance per round that he receives a flash of intellect. Check for this flash at the start of the qlippoth lord's turn in combat. If the chance succeeds, for that round Thuskchoon loses his nearly mindless weakness and can use his spell-like abilities freely and engage in combat tactics on par with those of a typical human. During that round, Thuskchoon can attempt Knowledge checks untrained with a +20 insight bonus (he retains his -4 penalty from his Intelligence score of 3, so this means his Knowledge checks are attempted with a +16 bonus for this round). The next round, the chance of an intellectual flash occurring is reduced to 0%, but then increases by 20% each subsequent round.",
			"",
			"**Nearly Mindless (Ex)** Thuskchoon's limited intellect and his overwhelming hunger combine to make the creature nearly mindless in his actions. Unless he uses his intellectual flash ability or gains the benefit of false intellect, he cannot activate any spell-like abilities and his tactical choices in combat are those of a violent animal. While in his nearly mindless state, Thuskchoon gains a +8 bonus on all saving throws against mind-affecting effects.",
			"",
			"**Trailing Tar (Ex)** Thuskchoon exudes a thick swath of sticky, tarlike sludge whenever he moves using his base speed. Any square he passes over using this base speed is transformed into difficult terrain for 1 hour. Freedom of movement allows free passage through this sticky terrain, and a dose of universal solvent can cleanse one 5-foot-square area of tar. Spell effects that cleanse an area of filth or detritus can also remove this difficult terrain, provided the spell effect in question is 6th level or higher.",
			"",
			"#### Description",
			"",
			"Not all of the qlippoth lords have alien intelligences that outstrip the minds of most mortals. In the case of Thuskchoon, the qlippoth lord's intellect is replaced almost entirely by a ravenous need to consume and feed. Now and then, the qlippoth lord gains flashes of insight and momentarily comprehends vast puzzles of reality, yet those brief insights fade quickly. These periods of insight are lengthened when Thuskchoon consumes prey, for as he digests flesh, he also digests thought, and can parasitize his victim's minds in order to act with purpose.",
			"",
			"Thuskchoon's Abyssal sanctum is a vast warren of tunnels that wind through the depths of the Abyss and connect most, if not all, of the other qlippoth sanctums. Rarely does he spend time in this maze of caves, though, instead aimlessly wandering the depths of the Abyss in constant search of anything to sate his eternal hunger. Now and then, the qlippoth lord blunders through portals that bring his ravenings to other planes, whereupon it is but a matter of time before he is banished or slain and forced to start his wanderings over anew from his sanctum's heart.",
			"",
			"Thuskchoon measures 40 feet in length and weighs 16,000 pounds.",
			"",
			"### Thuskchoon's Cult",
			"",
			"The worshipers of Thuskchoon refer to the qlippoth lord as the Everglutton to honor his nearly mindless and nigh-constant hunger. Cultists of this unusual qlippoth lord venerate him while not expecting much in the way of intentional reward, for a core part of the faith is the acknowledgement that Thuskchoon is not particularly driven by intellect. The secrets he reveals are potent and world-shaking, yet they are accidental revelations-the circumstantial repercussions of the meandering swaths of destruction the Everglutton leaves in his wake as he lumbers through creation. Temples of Thuskchoon are converted from large caverns or ruined buildings, but the cult is nomadic and never remains in one location for long. Visions of new regions to savage and destroy constantly plague the leaders of this qlippoth lord's cults, but now and then they may settle in a region for a few years. In these cases, they tend to carve hideous pictographs and foul Abyssal prayers into the stones that make up their temporary shrines. Just as the qlippoth lord himself can gain momentary flashes of insight from the minds of digested victims, so do his cultists constantly seek new drugs, poisons, and exotic consumables to feed upon in hopes of being granted strange visions or unexpected answers to questions they haven't dared ask.",
			"",
			"Thuskchoon's symbol is a triangular rune with teeth, and his favored weapon is the greatclub. He grants access to the domains of Chaos, Destruction, Evil, and Knowledge, and to the subdomains of Catastrophe, Entropy, Rage, and Thought.",

			"**Gaze Weapon (Su)** As a free action at the start of his turn, Yamasoth can gape his central maw wide to expose the horrific red eye lodged in what should be his throat. This gaze weapon has a range of 30 feet, and polymorphs creatures affected by it into giant vermin, animals, or magical beasts (Fortitude DC 37 resists). Yamasoth chooses what creatures to transform victims into as they fail their saving throws. This effect otherwise functions as polymorph any object (CL 20th), and is a polymorph effect. Yamasoth can keep his maw open for up to 3 consecutive rounds, after which his throat-eye closes and this gaze weapon cannot be used again for 1 minute. The save DC is Constitution-based.",
			"",
			"**Horrific Appearance (Su)** Creatures that succumb to Yamasoth's horrific appearance are stunned. At the start of each round thereafter, a creature stunned in this way can make a choice- fight the overwhelming chaos and horror and attempt a new DC 29 Will save to end the stun effect and act normally on that round, or accept the chaos into its soul and automatically succeed at the save to recover from the stun effect. This latter option immediately shifts the creature's alignment one step closer to chaotic evil. This shift in alignment can be fixed via atonement, but counts as a voluntary alignment shift for the purposes of atonement's material component requirements. A creature that becomes chaotic evil as a result of this also becomes a willing minion and ally of Yamasoth.",
			"",
			"**Maw (Ex)** Yamasoth's central maw is a primary attack that threatens a critical hit on a roll of 19-20. A creature hit by Yamasoth's maw while his gaze weapon is active takes a -4 penalty on its next saving throw against the gaze attack.",
			"",
			"**Polymorph Plague (Su)** Any creature that has been affected by one of Yamasoth's polymorph effects becomes \"contagious.\" For 24 hours after the creature's initial transformation, any other creature that touches or is touched by the polymorphed creature must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC = 10 + 1/2 the polymorphed creature's HD + the polymorphed creature's Constitution modifier) to resist polymorphing into a creature identical to the current form of the polymorphed creature.",

			"Yamasoth, known also as the Polymorph Plague, dwells in the endless cavern realm of Sekatar-Seraktis in the Abyss. Constantly at war with bickering balor lords and other powerful demons, Yamasoth has held his own as the lord of the Abyss's largest, most centralized region: the Kingdom of New Flesh. The \"new flesh\" in question consists of the qlippoth lord's subjects' men and women from countless worlds who may have been kings and queens at one time, but here are nothing more than base monsters, vermin, and beasts to serve at Yamasoth's whim. Some he feeds upon. Others he keeps for his harem. But the bulk of the denizens of the Kingdom of New Flesh are soldiers. In this army, other qlippoth serve as commanders and generals, particularly Yamasoth's favored minions, the [gongorinans](monster/gongorinan).",
			"",
			"Unlike most qlippoth, Yamasoth does not necessarily prefer to kill but rather to transform. A human who sins and dies produces a soul that fuels the demonic horde, but a dumb beast or feral monster who dies is merely carrion. By transforming free-willed mortals into monsters, Yamasoth's Army of the New Flesh only becomes more capable of ending worlds. Yamasoth's centuries-long alliance with Runelord Alaznist may have eventually resulted in such an assault on Golarion, but the devastation of Earthfall ended those plans before Yamasoth's burgeoning realm could finalize its gestation-proof that even in the greatest of disasters, some good is wrought.",
			"",
			"Yamasoth's interest in transformations goes far beyond mere polymorphing. The qlippoth lord is also fascinated by the act of fleshwarping and reworking life into new forms of mutants. Rumors state that the nature of the experiments that take place deep in the Kingdom of New Flesh closely mimic those the daemons performed in the Abyss so long ago that resulted in the first demons. In fact, some dissident demonologists claim Yamasoth himself is a nascent demon lord, and is in fact that first, primal demon born of daemonic tampering with Abyssal quintessence and sinful souls.",

For the next 700 years, she wandered throughout the peaks of Avistan, staying briefly with each stone giant clan she met along the way. From the Tusks to the Mindspins she roamed, though she was inevitably drawn to leave each new tribe soon after she discovered them. During these journeys she claimed her giant name, Rahstalshan, \"the wanderer in stone.\"",

Near the mountain's top she found an inviting cave overlooking the sprawling lands of the frozen north. Though she had no way of being sure, the ancient stone giant felt that these mountains were her true homeland. Settled in her cave, at peace, she waited for death to take her. Instead, for the first time in her long life, she heard the whispers in the stone, awakening within her the ancient earth magic of her people. She descended from the heights and soon came upon a fledgling tribe of stone giants, bereft of an elder and as lost as she had been. She has guided their path ever since."

Even if it succeeds at this save, the creature can't breathe, speak, or cast spells with verbal components while it remains swallowed.",
			"",
			"#### Description",
			"",
			"Void dragons are a cursed race, born on the boundary between rational space and the vast unknowable nothingness that lurks between the stars. They are not typically evil, but few escape the notice of the unnamable beings that dwell within that distant void. The fortunate ones resist the fell influence of the Dark Tapestry and survive with their minds intact.",
			"",
			"Raskineya was not one of the fortunate ones. The taint of the void shattered her mind, driving her to mindless violence and destruction. In her madness she sought out the inner planets of Golarion's solar system, plunging into the gravity wells of the inhabited worlds to feed and raze before fleeing back to the stars and plotting her next attack.",
			"",
			"This urge to destroy is what brought her to the attention of the cult of Rovagug. Priests of the Rough Beast often enslave powerful creatures to serve as proxies for their shackled god and guardians for their hidden temples, and Raskineya's savagery and madness made her an excellent prospect. The priests called to the stars, whispering promises of blood to the dragon to lure her into their waiting clutches. In her unthinking madness, she was no match for the cunning priests, and soon she was subdued, shackled, and locked in a cavern hidden deep within the earth.",
			"",
			"Raskineya languished at first, longing to once again fly to the stars and seek exotic new prey. Yet the priests had not lied to her when they promised her blood. She was given sacrifices and allowed to hunt and feed within her underground prison. With each such sacrifice, she not only grew stronger and more focused, but also found began to understand the prayers given to her. This world was promised to Rovagug, and he would have it. All worlds were promised to him, and he would destroy them all. Even the gods themselves would fall to his power, and in his wake only nothingness would remain. Raskineya found in Rovagug something she had not realized she was searching for: someone to champion. If she could but release this Unmaker, she could at long last have vengeance upon this existence, and upon the nameless ones who drew her here. All that would be left in his wake would be nothingness, and to nothingness her heart longed to return.",
			"",
			"With her newfound sense of purpose, Raskineya turned upon her captors. Her mind intact for the first time in centuries, she quickly overpowered them. First, she swallowed the high priest alive, consuming his life and essence to fuel her ascension. Then she enslaved the priests, and commanded them to find her a way to unleash their god upon the world once more. From them she learned of a prophecy, set down by the oracles of the brimstone haruspex, that a dark comet would herald the return of Gormuz-the first and most powerful of Rovagug's spawn-who would in turn unleash the Rough Beast himself. Raskineya sees herself as this dark comet, and demands all those who address her to call her by that name (with a slow death awaiting to those who do not).",
			"",
			"In the years since her ascension, Raskineya first scoured the world searching for the Star Towers-artifacts created by the gods to strengthen Rovagug's prison. The dragon was certain that if she could locate the first of these towers and destroy it, the rest will fall like dominoes, weakening the foundations of Rovagug's prison enough to allow his escape. She moved from Star Tower to Star Tower, searching for clues as to the location of the original. She last conquered the Star Tower of Vekheen, winning it from a paladin of Sarenrae named Dazma the Bright, who had learned of the dragon's design on the tower and marshaled an army to defend it. Raskineya vanquished Dazma and her army by dragging meteors from the sky to drop on the Sarenites. Those who survived the initial bombardment were savaged by akatas carried within the meteors, leaving the remainder easy pickings for the dragon.",
			"",
			"Though it seemed she was getting closer to her goal, Raskineya's devotion to Rovagug made her actions unpredictable. Just as she conquered the Star Tower of Vekheen, she heard a pressing call she believed came from Rovagug himself. She flew to the Pit of Gormuz, where she made a den in the Crater of Carnal Joining in anticipation of the Rough Beast's arrival. There she waits, conducting horrific rituals to attract his attention. She brought with her the Sarenite survivors of the raid on the Star Tower, who she keeps alive as subjects for her rites. Once noble soldiers, they're now maimed and driven mad, kept in perpetual darkness within a small cave in Raskineya's lair. The warriors of the Maimed Legion, as she calls them, see light only when they're being tortured."

			"**Divine Deception (Su)** Once per day while Shamira uses her change shape ability, she can choose to emulate a different alignment for the purpose of divination spells that reveal auras (such as detect evil). This effect persists as long as she carries a holy symbol of a deity of the same alignment she wishes to emulate. This holy symbol must have been given to her within the previous hour by a worshiper of that deity; Shamira typically secures these symbols via mind control. This effect last for 2d6 hours, after which point the holy symbol crumbles to ashes. While it lasts, spells and other magical effects treat her alignment as if it were the feigned alignment, not her true alignment of chaotic evil. If she uses a symbol of Sarenrae to appear neutral good, this effect lasts for 24 hours before the symbol crumbles to dust.",
			"",
			"**Dream Haunting (Su)** Shamira can use her energy drain attack, mind-affecting spell-like abilities, and profane benediction abilities on any creature she successfully affects with her nightmare spell-like ability while that ability is in effect. Once she uses one of these abilities against her target, the nightmare spell ends-she can only use one of these abilities per use of nightmare.",
			"",
			"**Energy Drain (Su)** Shamira's energy drain ability functions like that of a succubus, except that it drains 2 levels per use. As a free action as part of this attack, she may choose use her burn special attack with her energy drain. With a successful DC 36 Will save, a character resists the suggestion implanted by this attack, and a successful DC 36 Fortitude save negates the negative level after 24 hours.

Creatures with fire resistance and no immunity to mind-affecting effects take fire damage from Shamira's attacks as if they had no fire resistance.",

			"",

If the target is a worshiper of Sarenrae, the target also gains immunity to fire as long as the profane benediction persists, even if the worshiper at some point later abandons her faith in Sarenrae (as is often the case with those who are eager to keep their profane benedictions).",
			"",
			"**Summon Demons (Sp)** As a nascent demon lord, Shamira can summon any demon or combination of demons whose total combined CR is 20 or lower. This ability always works, and is equivalent to a 9th-level spell.",

			"Shamira, the Ardent Dream, is the nominal ruler of the isle of Alinythia, and by extension the city of Alushinyrra, but with the honor of ruling the largest of the Midnight Isles comes with an unwritten caveat-Nocticula's palace overlooks the city from its own isle. While this position is one that Shamira revels in, and one that has afforded her no small amount of influence (indeed, it's helped to propel her into the ranks of nascent demon lords), the Ardent Dream knows that her mistress watches over her always, and surely regards her not only as a valued lover, companion, and minion, but also as the closest thing Nocticula has to competition. Of course, Shamira does keep an eye out for any opportunity she has to erode some of Nocticula's power, for someday she hopes to wear Nocticula's crown.",
			"",
			"Shamira is unique in her appearance. Even before she became a nascent demon lord, her burning wings and flowing crimson hair marked her as a succubus of power. Close-lipped about her history, she appeared in Nocticula's palace one moonrise and seduced the Lady in Shadow, thus earning the position of Lady of Alinythia. (Nocticula banished Shamira's predecessor, an incubus named Ziforian, to the sewers below the city, where he may yet lurk.) None in the Abyss recall this majestic and unmistakable succubus in the city before her arrival in Nocticula's boudoir. Shamira does little to quell rumors that her previous home was a much loftier place than the Abyss, and her resemblance to the deity Sarenrae provides endless speculation."

			"Even before he was recruited by Deskari to raze the Green Faith from Sarkoris, the vrolikai Shaorhaz had a long tradition of antipathy toward the druidic faith. When Shaorhaz first came to the Material Plane to grow, he had the misfortune of appearing in the small village of Rookhill in southeastern Ustalav. At first, Shaorhaz met little opposition from the villagers, and he fed with impunity. But then a cabal of druids came to Rookhill's aid, and Shaorhaz found his hunting grounds increasingly well guarded and dangerous. Stubborn to a fault, the nabasu refused to move on to easier hunting grounds elsewhere, and time and time again, he clashed with the druids. With each attempt to kill them, though, the druids grew more and more adept at fighting the nabasu, and with each dawn, it seemed that the very wilderness in which he had enjoyed hiding for so many months was turning against him. When the nabasu was nearly slain by the druids' treant ally, he made a desperate attempt to assassinate their leader. This foolish assault earned the nabasu nothing more than the loss of his accumulated growth, as the druid sacrificed his life to return the spiritual energies the demon had fed upon to the land. Only then did Shaorhaz flee Ustalav, teleporting to another wilderness to start over. It took the demon 10 times as long as he'd hoped to finally achieve apotheosis and transform to a vrolikai, and in that time, his hatred of the druidic faith only grew.",
			"",
			"Today, Shaorhaz rules over the ruins of the Forest of Stones in what was once northern Sarkoris. This region, known today as the Stonewilds, was once sacred to the Green Faith, but now the only druids who remain are the warped and twisted undead abominations known as siabraes, for when it became clear that Shaorhaz had won the battle, the last few druids turned again to sacrifice to defeat the demon. Yet this time, the tactic did not work. This time, Shaorhaz was prepared, and the vile energies he commanded reflected back upon the druids, turning them into the very things they detested most. Since then, Shaorhaz has spent the majority of his time within his palace, Greengrave, searching for a way to feed not on more mortal souls but upon the very soul of Golarion itself.",
			"",
			"Shaorhaz prefers offerings of druids, especially those of the Green Faith. He often promises to let these offerings live if they can reveal to him something of the druidic faith that he has not already confirmed for himself-those druids foolish enough to take the demon at his word get the deaths they deserve. It's a DC 33 check to research the Glutton of the Green."

			"**Crush (Ex)** Ulunat uses its immense size as a formidable weapon. As a standard action, Ulunat can move over enemies or objects, using its whole body to crush them, dealing 20d6+30 points of damage. Crush attacks are effective only against opponents that are Huge or smaller. This attack affects as many creatures as fit in Ulunat's space. Creatures in the affected area must succeed at a DC 39 Reflex save or be pinned, automatically taking bludgeoning damage during the next round unless Ulunat moves off them. If Ulunat chooses to maintain the pin, it must succeed at a combat maneuver check as normal. Pinned foes take damage from the crush each round if they don't escape. The save DC is Strength-based.",
			"",
			"**Devour Magic (Ex)** Ulunat has the ability to absorb magic directed at it and create arcane feedback that has the potential to shred a spellcaster's mind. Whenever Ulunat is targeted by a spell or spell-like ability, the caster must succeed at a DC 30 Will save or be affected as if he were targeted by phantasmal killer. If Ulunat is in the area of effect of a spell or spell-like ability, the caster must succeed at a DC 30 Will save or be affected as if he were targeted by insanity. The save DC is Charisma-based.",
			"",
			"**Hibernation (Ex)** Ulunat can sleep for centuries and doesn't need to eat during these periods of dormancy, though it eats ravenously and almost constantly once it has been awakened. If Ulunat is forced into an inhospitable environment, it goes into hibernation until conditions are right for it to reawaken. While in hibernation, Ulunat's damage reduction improves to 50/epic and it gains immunity to any spell or spell-like ability that allows spell resistance as well as all divination effects.",
			"",
			"**Massive (Ex)** Because of Ulunat's size, uneven ground and other terrain features that form difficult terrain generally pose no significant hindrance to its movement, though forests or settlements are considered difficult terrain. A Huge or smaller creature can move through any square Ulunat occupies, and vice versa. Ulunat can make attacks of opportunity only against foes that are Huge or larger, and can be flanked only by Huge or larger foes. Ulunat gains a bonus for being on higher ground only if its entire space is on higher ground than that of its target. It's possible for a Huge or smaller creature to climb Ulunat with a successful DC 30 Climb check, however unlike the normal rules regarding Ulunat and attacks of opportunity, a Small or larger creature that climbs on Ulunat provokes an attack of opportunity from the monster.",
			"",
			"**Regeneration (Ex)** Like all Spawn of Rovagug, Ulunat is a nearly indestructible force. No form of attack can suppress Ulunat's regeneration-it regenerates even if disintegrated or slain by a death effect. If Ulunat fails a save against an effect that would kill it instantly, it rises from death 3 rounds later with 1 hit point if no further damage is dealt to its remains. It can be banished or otherwise transported as a means to save a region from devastation, but a method to kill Spawn of Rovagug like Ulunat has yet to be discovered.",
			"",
			"**Terrible Claws (Ex)** Ulunat's natural weapons ignore all forms of damage reduction and hardness.",
			"",
			"**Tremor Step (Ex)** Ulunat's thunderous steps shake the ground as it moves. While moving along the ground, any creatures within 100 feet of Ulunat that are also in contact with the ground must succeed at a DC 39 Reflex save or be knocked prone as the beast thunders along. The save DC is Strength-based.",

			"Ulunat's carapace towers above Sothis, creating what is now known as the Black Dome. The most exclusive part of the city, the Black Dome shields its district from the sun's blazing heat and the desert's blistering sandstorms. Beneath the Black Dome sit palaces and monuments, the most important of which is the seat of Sothis's government and the home of the Ruby Prince.",
			"",
			"The stories from the beginning of the First Age of Osirion claim that Azghaad killed Ulunat-some even say that he achieved this feat with the divine help of Nethys-but the truth is that the Spawn of Rovagug are unkillable. After a lengthy and dangerous battle, Azghaad banished Ulunat to a pocket realm beneath the place where its bloated shell still stands. In this realm, under the oldest and largest settlement in Osirion, Ulunat sleeps.",
			"",
			"Before this ancient conflict, the great beast emerged from the Pit of Gormuz and thundered across Golarion. As Ulunat neared what is now Sothis, cultists of Rovagug channeling the power of raw chaos in a massive ritual- chanting cacophonous praises to the Rough Beast- opened a direct link between Ulunat and Rovagug. Empowered by this divine connection, Ulunat grew to an immense size and charged across the land, trampling everything in its path.",
			"",
			"Now, thousands of years later, the Unholy First has begun to stir in its prison. Numerous past attempts to free the Unholy First have failed, and most of these were hidden from the public and Osirion's official history in hopes that the proper method for freeing Ulunat would remain unknown. However, this doesn't stop cultists and doomsayers from trying to bring back the terrible beast.",

			"",
			"**Coruscating Charge (Su)** When Talmandor charges, he can transform his body into golden light. He becomes incorporeal until he arrives at the end of his charge and makes his physical attacks. In this form, he radiates light as a daylight spell. Any evil creature whose space he passes through is affected as by sunbeam (Reflex DC 35 negates and Reflex half), while good-aligned creatures whose space he passes through gain the benefit of good hope for 1d4 rounds.

The defensive benefits from the magic circle are not included in the statistics above.",
			"",
			"**Quell the Profane (Su)** Talmandor's frightful presence aura affects only evil creatures. Evil creatures inside Talmandor's protective aura also become sickened, and profane bonuses are suppressed within his aura unless their caster level exceeds 20th.",
			"",
			"**Sacred Slasher (Ex)** When attacking with his claws, Talmandor adds 1-1/2 times his Strength bonus on damage rolls. He also threatens a critical hit on a roll of 18-20 and multiplies critical hit damage by 3. His claws overcome all damage reduction of evil creatures.",
			"",
			"**Twin Talons (Ex)** When using the attack action, Talmandor can attack a single target with both claws.",
			"",
			"#### Description",
			"",
			"Talmandor is the celestial patron of Andoran and a great leader of the avoral agathions, surpassed among their kind only by the empyreal lord Ylimancha, the Harborwing. Talmandor abides in the aptly named Soaring Palace of Talmandor the Golden on the plane of Nirvana, yet travels frequently among the planes. In addition to looking in on the nation that has arisen under his wings, he wanders the Outer Sphere, often acting as an ambassador between mortal priesthoods and the immortal servants of Erastil, Iomedae, and Shelyn.",
			"",
			"Like most agathions, Talmandor takes an interest in influencing mortals and bringing them to a place of enlightenment. He is convinced that the greatest enlightenment for mortals can be achieved through social interaction. He has observed that mortals respond best to a full, robust engagement with their fellow citizens, and that it's important to have a voice in the decisionmaking process of one's society. Talmandor sees hereditary aristocracy and primogeniture as shackles slowing society's ascent into a place of justice and peace where all citizens work together for the common good. Talmandor does not want the rights and importance of individuals to be sacrificed for the greater good, and advocates a balance between collective needs and communitarian works on the one hand and the individual's personal responsibilities and liberties on the other.",
			"",
			"According to popular legend, Talmandor developed his democratic theories and shared them with the mortal poet Darl Jubannich, who transcribed them in his nowfamous treatise, On Government. However, while Talmandor favored overturning established structures of power where necessary, he never promoted anarchy and has long felt great sadness over how the core tenets of his political philosophy have been twisted beyond recognition in Galt. He strives to promote moderation and peaceful reconciliation within government, even in times of upheaval.",
			"",
			"In some parts of Andoran, the adulation Talmandor has earned goes beyond respect to outright worship. The agathion steadfastly refuses to seek godhood in his own right, as he believes he can be a better inspiration to the goals of democratic freedom as a powerful outsider who can aid the mortal citizens of Andoran in times of great need, rather than becoming a godlike creature they worship from afar. Talmandor typically assists only those he feels have earned the right to call upon any ally of Andoran, though he is pleased to give advice to anyone if asked in earnest. He often appears to speak when called upon by the People's Council, offering what guidance he can, but never insists that his suggestions be enacted. He has been known to appear at the meetings of smaller city and town councils as well, though as a guest he does not speak until the council asks him to. Only if Andoran faced some threat it found impossible to handle on its own without his aid would Talmandor take direct action to protect the nation, though his regular presence is certainly considered carefully by Andoran's enemies.",
			"",
			"Though Andoran celebrates a feast day in his honor on 4 Erastus, Talmandor insists the celebration is held to honor him in his capacity as one of many heroes of the nation, rather than as its divine protector. Despite his refusal of the mantle of divinity, a few in Andoran (including a small but growing number of oracles and paladins) revere him as a nascent demigod embodying the virtues of hope, liberty, and community, and his worship has begun to grow in small congregations across the country.",
			"",
			"Talmandor is closely associated with birds of prey and as a result is the patron of the Steel Falcons order of the Eagle Knights of Andoran, as well as a frequent advisor to leaders within the order. Talmandor inspires their work as ambassadors of liberty, and he sometimes even sends aid to those in the midst of dangerous political missions aimed at cultivating peace. Those who rise to greatness also receive Talmandor's direct blessing, which he sees as a rightful reward for good works and a tool that allows those blessed to achieve even greater things. If called to serve through powerful magic (such as gate), Talmandor generally answers but refuses to grant direct assistance except to those overwhelmingly outmatched by evil foes. Even then, he generally requires any aid he gives be paid for in massive donations to the poor and oppressed, though he also often offers a free alternative to his direct involvement, such as receiving his blessing (often crafted with miracle) or gaining some insight into the caller's foes."

It shared none of its progenitors' desires to see Shub-Niggurath's return to Golarion, and eventually left Denebrum entirely. Thath-Malal now resides in the lowest levels of Tian Xia's Darklands, having found its way there by the guidance of determined seugathi explorers and has had several centuries to formulate its strategy for convincing the other species in the area to pay it appropriate tribute.",

Amused, Thath-Malal hopes to expand its influence into Nagajor and Po Li."

The Mourning One only recently escaped its Darklands prison, winding its way through the perilous tunnels of Orv up into Sekamina, and now dwells in Lake Nirthran-the Dying Sea.",
			"",
			"The ghouls of Nemret Noktoria have seen the Mourning One slide through the waters of Lake Nirthran, and avaricious necromancers among their kind occasionally undertake voyages to try to capture the beast for the valuable black blood that seeps from its pores. The skum of Cold Momugado, on the other hand, do not seek the creature for its strange properties-most merely wish the nuisance dead and gone, as it has proven a menace to skum scavengers and raiders since its first sighting. Still other inhabitants of the Darklands would like to see the Mourning One put to different uses-in Delvingulf, drow fleshwarpers view the monstrous sea serpent as a figure of great awe as well as potential. If it were to be captured, they could perhaps learn how to further utilize the strange substance known as black blood in subsequent experiments."

			"The Whispering Tyrant was perhaps the greatest threat that the people of the Inner Sea have ever known. Even after his defeat atop Gallowspire, he wasn't finished. The forces that brought him low had no choice but to seal him within the tower that was once his capital.",
			"",
			"Before becoming a lich, the Whispering Tyrant was a powerful necromancer by the name Tar-Baphon. Though his origins are lost to time, it's thought that he grew up on the shores of Lake Encarthan, where he first studied the necromantic arts. As his power grew, so did his ambition, eventually leading him to the Cenotaph, the resting place of the slumbering runelord of gluttony. After unlocking the powers of Zutha, Tar-Baphon gained power beyond that of mortals. He realized then that true greatness required bringing the world itself under his control-alive or dead, all would serve him.",
			"",
			"His campaign was brutal. Enlisting nearby orcs and undead, he quickly conquered Ustalav and began a conquest that consumed most of central Avistan. He set down stones on the Isle of Terror, intent upon making it his capital. His actions drew the attention of Aroden, the Last Azlanti, who knew what destruction the runelords had caused, and refused to allow the world to return to those ancient ways. The two met on the Isle of Terror in 896 ar. The battle raged for days and leveled the entire surface of the island. Tar-Baphon's broken form lay among the rubble, and Aroden buried him there, thinking that was the end of the threat.",
			"",
			"However, Tar-Baphon had intended to die by Aroden's hand all along. His studies had revealed to him that his only true path to immortality lay in undeath. For Tar-Baphon's last step in becoming a lich beyond compare, he needed to be killed by a god, and Aroden served this purpose. The process sparked by Aroden took time, however, and for 2,307 years Tar-Baphon's body laid dead in the ground before he returned to grim unlife. The Whispering Tyrant was born.",
			"",
			"He soon reestablished his power, animating thousands of dead. For centuries, the forces of the living were unable to resist the tide of the dead-with Aroden gone, nothing could stop the Whispering Tyrant. Only the Shining Crusade had a chance to end his threat. Bearing the Shield of Aroden, General Arnisant faced the lich, but when the Whispering Tyrant used a wish to summon the general's heart to his waiting claw, the symbol of Aroden flared to life, the shield shattered, and the lich's body was destroyed. Without a means to locate the Tyrant's phylactery, let alone destroy it, the crusaders instead sealed him away in his tower, where their descendants remain ever watchful for his return."

			"**Aura of Corruption (Su)** Treerazer exudes an aura of corruption to a radius of 120 feet. This aura causes plants to grow hideous, sprouting thorns, twisting, and becoming fungoid in nature. Creatures with woodland stride or freedom of movement can move through this fungal bloom with ease. Living creatures within Treerazer's aura of corruption must make a DC 39 Fortitude save each round or their flesh grows pasty and clammy as tendrils of diseased plant matter and fungal growth sprout from it. This condition persists as long as the creature remains within Treerazer's aura of corruption and for 1 minute thereafter. While suffering the effects of this aura, the living creature is treated as a plant for the purposes of spells and effects that harm or otherwise inconvenience plant creatures more than other creatures. The victim would thus be subject to antiplant shell, blight, and additional damage from horrid wilting or a plant bane weapon, and could be affected by control plants. The corruption does not otherwise impart plant traits to creatures. The save DC is Constitution-based.",
			"",
			"**Defoliation (Su)** As a standard action once every 1d4 rounds, Treerazer can exude a pulse of defoliating energy in a 30-foot-radius spread. This pulse appears as a wave of sickly green energy, and causes all plants and plant creatures in the area to blacken and wither. Such creatures take 20d10 points of damage and 1d8 points of Strength drain, or half with a successful DC 39 Fortitude save. A plant that isn't a creature (such as a tree or a shrub) doesn't receive a save and immediately withers and dies. Treerazer can choose to exclude any number of plants in the area from this effect, and generally does so to preserve twisted and corrupted plants and fungus. The save DC is Constitution-based.",
			"",
			"**Nascent Demon Lord Traits** A nascent demon lord is a powerful demon that has not yet made the full transition from unique demon to full demon lord of an Abyssal realm. Treerazer's current exile to the Material Plane prevents him from achieving full demon lord status. Yet he still possesses the typical nascent demon lord traits, which are similar to those possessed by a typical demon, only more potent, as summarized here.",

After a failed attempt to wrest that crown away from Cyth-V-sug, Treerazer fled to the Material Plane. Cyth-V-sug was unable (or perhaps only unwilling) to pursue, but took steps to ensure that Treerazer would remain there by exiling him, transforming Treerazer into a native outsider and severing his bond to the Abyss-if the Lord of the Blasted Tarn is slain, his animus will not return to the Abyss and reform. Death, to Treerazer, is a permanent thing.",

			"Treerazer arrived on Golarion near the end of the Age of Darkness, and found the savaged planet much to his liking-so much so that the sting of exile was somewhat ameliorated. He spent many centuries wandering the remote corners of Golarion before finally coming upon the abandoned elven nation of Kyonin in 2497 ar. In the Sovyrian Stone, he found an artifact that he believed he could use to reinstate his Abyssal link and, perhaps, even uproot the entire nation and refocus the portal from Sovyrian to the Abyss, thereby reclaiming his position there and taking one more step toward revenge against Cyth-V-sug. Yet the elves sensed his tamperings and returned to confront the demon. A terrific battle resulted, and while the elves were able to drive Treerazer out of Iadara and into southern Kyonin, they were unable to slay him or force him out completely-they merely concentrated his power in a smaller region. Instead, the elves -walled off - this region, a perverted realm known today as the Tanglebriar. Treerazer lurks at the Tanglebriar's heart to this day, the greatest bogeyman in elven mythology and a very real and constant threat to the nation's security.",
			"",
			"Treerazer begins most combats by casting time stop and raising an antiplant shell to prevent plant creatures (including creatures under the effect of his aura of corruption) from approaching. If he has time, he also creates walls of thorns and summons demons (usually four nalfeshnees and 12 hezrous). In melee, Treerazer gleefully takes up Blackaxe and makes full attacks against the closest foe, or Greater Vital Strikes if he's forced to move or charge. During the first 3 rounds of combat, he targets obvious spell effects with quickened greater dispel magic. If Treerazer is reduced to fewer than 150 hit points, he teleports back to his fortress, Witchbole, to recover and plan his revenge."

Now firmly entrenched in a network of surface caverns, Triaza and her cult prey on those passing to and from the nearest major settlement-the human city of Riddleport.",

She has few concerns about the adventurers and mercenaries of Riddleport who investigate the attacks, but worries significantly more about retaining power. Triaza keeps the members of her cult pacified by allowing them various means of venting their depraved and violent desires, yet still worries about her tenure as ruler, given that her cult is now cut off from the rest of urdefhan society. A time may come when her underlings decide she is not fit to lead, and instead plot to push her to pair with a daemon to continue the propagation of the cult. She has no solid arguments against the importance of increasing their numbers, but is loath to accede to a plan that would take her away from the bountiful death-dealing opportunities offered by the surface world, which are the only activities in which she finds any pleasure or fulfillment."

			"**Overcharge Synapses (Su)** As a standard action, Tychilarius can overstimulate the nervous system of any creature that has taken Intelligence damage from Tychilarius's shatter mind ability. The target takes 15d6 points of electricity damage as every nerve in its body misfires. This damage can be reduced to half with a successful DC 32 Fortitude saving throw. The save DC is Charisma-based.",
			"",
			"**Plasma Bolt (Su)** As a standard action, Tychilarius can fire a bolt of plasma from one of its tentacles at a target within 300 feet (no range increment) as a ranged touch attack. On a successful hit, a plasma bolt deals 15d6 points of damage, half of which is electricity damage and half of which is fire damage.",
			"",
			"**Reform Flesh (Su)** Tychilarius can use the flesh and energy from a creature killed by its void maw ability to give birth to other creatures associated with the Dominion of the Black. It can create a number of such creatures whose total Hit Dice equal that of the creature killed by void maw. For example, if Tychilarius killed a 20th-level human wizard in its void maw, it could give birth to two nehthalggus. This process takes 24 hours.",
			"",
			"**Shatter Mind (Su)** Tychilarius exudes quivering psychic energy. Any creature adjacent to Tychilarius must succeed at a DC 32 Will saving throw or take 1d4 points of Intelligence damage. This is a mind-affecting effect, and the save DC is Charisma-based.",
			"",
			"**Starflight (Su)** In outer space, Tychilarius can survive in the void and fly at an incredible speed. Its travel times vary, but a trip within a single solar system should take it 3d20 hours, and a trip farther than that should take it 3d20 days or more if Tychilarius knows the way to its destination.",
			"",
			"**Void Maw (Su)** When Tychilarius bites and successfully grabs a creature, it can attempt a combat maneuver check as a free action to draw the creature into its massive, chaotic form (as though attempting to pin the target). A creature drawn into Tychilarius's void maw must succeed at a DC 39 Will saving throw each round or be confused for 1 round. This is a mind-affecting confusion effect, and the save DC is Constitution-based.",
			"",
			"Though this ability is similar to swallow whole, a creature in the maw can't cut its way out. Any creature in the area of a magic circle against evil or magic circle against chaos spell is unaffected by the confusion effect. A swallowed creature can escape by using plane shift or similar magic. Every day a creature remains in this void, it gains 1 negative level. A creature that dies from this effect is incorporated into Tychilarius's form; it can be reshaped into another creature via reform flesh, and is difficult to resurrect. Anyone attempting to resurrect a creature killed in the maw must succeed at a DC 32 caster level check to return the creature to life. The caster level check DC is Charisma-based.",
			"",
			"#### Description",
			"",
			"Golarion first heard the name Tychilarius thousands of years ago, when various Garundi tribes gathered in the nascent nation of Osirion and began to build the great empire that would one day arise there. Little information regarding Tychilarius from this bygone era survives to the current day, and what has resurfaced is contradictory and vague. What is known is that Tychilarius is a powerful leader in the Dominion of the Black, a starfaring association of creatures from the Dark Tapestry.",
			"",
			"While Tychilarius's relationship with the early Osirians seems to have been primarily antagonistic, there is evidence that a few cults formed around the being. Many scholarly texts claim that these early cultists gave Tychilarius the appellation \"The Drowned God.\" That title, however, is a misnomer, for while Tychilarius is aquatic and extremely powerful, it can't grant spells and is not a god. In truth, the appellation is a mistranslation made by a scholar-cultist who was less than savvy about the intricacies of the Dominion of the Black's use of language. Older texts suggest that the closest accurate approximation of this being's title is \"They Drown the Gods in Oblivion.\" Modernday scholars, theologians, and would-be worshipers simply use the name \"Tychilarius.\" The name by which the early Osirian cultists addressed the creature has been lost to history, and most extant records suggest that they referred to the focus of their worship primarily by epithets.",
			"",
			"Many academics suspect that Tychilarius originally hailed from the planet Aucturn, considering the being's connection to Osirion and the countdown clocks within that country mysteriously linked to Aucturn's movement. However, recently uncovered texts retrieved from a Night Herald cult suggest that this creature's origin lies across the vastness of space in some far-flung galaxy as yet unmapped by Golarion's astronomers.",
			"",
			"Tychilarius seems to be a singular creature that is made up of thousands of other individual creatures fused into one horrific organism with a united intelligence. It is said that Tychilarius was birthed from a black hole into which millions of foul creatures had been pulled. They were ripped apart into mere particles and reassembled into the terror incarnate that was somehow ejected from the oblivion within the black hole.",
			"",
			"Tychilarius is believed to be immortal, and has traveled throughout the cosmos. Well after its creation, it likely spent time on Aucturn before coming to Golarion. Currently-mercifully-it is locked away in some manner of prison. The nature of this confinement is uncertain, but what matters is that for the moment, Tychilarius cannot reach Golarion. Scholars posit that the creature was banished while it dwelled in Osirion, perhaps by ancient Osirian wizards or clerics, and that the door and key to this prison still rest somewhere in that ancient nation.",
			"",
			"Cultists such as the Night Heralds have performed hundreds of rituals over the years to call Tychilarius back to this world, but to date none have succeeded. Despite these failures, the Night Heralds remain unfazed and continue their dark work. In recent years, a cell of Night Herald cultists uncovered a supposed relic that would draw Tychilarius from its prison into the body and mind of another being. Though the ritual failed and most of the cultists were slain, rumors insist the attempt was almost a success. Admittedly, these tales mostly circulate among other cultists eager to succeed where their predecessors failed. True or not, these claims have spurred an increase in such activity by the Night Heralds. While none have yet managed to free Tychilarius, their attempts have summoned a host of lesser, but still dangerous, malevolent creatures.",
			"",
			"Many scholars study beings such as Tychilarius out of simple curiosity or-especially among theologians of goodly churches-with an eye toward protecting the world from the ravages of these creatures. Yet the most knowledge of Tychilarius rests in the hands of those who study the Dominion of the Black and among the members of the Night Heralds, who hope to attract the attention of the creatures in the Dark Tapestry and bring about the end of Golarion. In addition to delving into this forbidden knowledge themselves, such cultists do what they can to eliminate it from the libraries of those who might use it to keep Tychilarius sealed away, stealing and destroying documents and even murdering scholars. If they ever successfully open the door to Tychilarius's prison, Golarion will certainly fall under the glaring eye of the Dominion, and it would be only a matter of time before the Dominion of the Black's organic starships begin dropping to the planet's surface."

Uchurah was poised to apprentice with the camp's spiritual leader, hoping one day to take on that role, when it began waking unrested each night, remembering horrible dreams.",

			"",
			"Guarding one of a few select entrances to the Midnight Mountains, the rage-filled gug now leads its camp on vicious raids against nearby enclaves of drow and skum. Each victory the camp secures supports Uchurah's claims of divinity, and its followers grow more and more devoted with each passing year. Though Uchurah can't cast any spells or heal its devotees, it nevertheless leads a thriving cult that could grow to be a powerful force in the Darklands."

			"Urburg Armbreaker was born into a tribe of hill giants residing in the Kodar Mountains near Southmoor in the Lands of the Linnorm Kings. Cursed with an unusually small stature, he was deemed a guff by his peers and tribal leaders. The true implications did not hit him until during a hunt his own people abandoned him, leaving the young hill giant to die in the wilds of the Grungir Forest.",
			"",
			"After nearly 20 years of fending for himself in the untamed wilderness, he reemerged from the woods and tracked down the tribe that had abandoned him so many years before. His people hardly recognized the battlescarred Urburg, but soon found themselves in a state of dread and admiration when the vengeful giant cleaved their current chieftain's head off with one swing of his mighty club, claiming the title for himself. Anger still burns within the betrayed hill giant, and his people know to fear Urburg's frequent bouts of violent, indiscriminate rage."

			"An awakened horror shaken from the depths of the sea by the catastrophic calling of Earthfall, the beast known as Urtleytlar swims the Arcadian Ocean, wreaking havoc wherever she treads. Urtleytlar is one of the Lesser Spawn of Rovagug, having escaped the Rough Beast's prison deep beneath the earth like those before her. The drow of Sekamina tell legends of a terrible many-headed beast crawling from the depths of the Dying Sea to prey upon their coastal settlements, and scholars among the dark elves hypothesize that this beast may have originated from somewhere in Orv. In this instance, their legends hold true, for Urtleytlar indeed swam the lightless depths of the Sightless Sea for centuries until she made it up the Braid, raided the aboleth population guarding the Inverted Sea, and emerged into a broken Azlant already claimed by the Arcadian Ocean.",
			"",
			"Urtleytlar spent her first millennia on Golarion's surface terrorizing the eastern coasts of Arcadia, after which the foul beast felt an irresistible call to the lands of the east. The world rippled with destruction after the passing of Aroden, and this surge of chaos washed over Urtleytlar as she felt the pull of her lord Rovagug in the Inner Sea region. She swam eastward, weaving through the shattered continent of Azlant, and as she headed toward the Eye of Abendego, she saw the storm as a manifestation of the Rough Beast's destructive power. The monstrous scylla delights in the powerful storm, and preaches Rovagug's words of destruction through the ruin she sows.",
			"",
			"Since making the Abendego Gulf her home, Urtleytlar has gathered numerous evil aquatic humanoids (and even depraved sailors) to her wretched bosom. The boggards and skum that make up the greatest number of her minions extend her reach to the broken shores of the Sodden Lands and Shackles. Some say she guides foolish sailors hoping to sail into the hurricane, providing them temporary safety in exchange for a taste of their souls.",
			"",
			"A handful of boggard tribes swear fealty to the Tempest Queen by capturing slaves and dragging them to the shores as sacrifices. Urtleytlar makes choice selections from among her minions' offerings, leaving the scraps for the boggards themselves to enjoy. Though she doesn't need the froglike humanoids for her conquests, she nonetheless enjoys their adoration. In addition to these minions, she counts a number of skum armies-left masterless after their abandonment by their aboleth rulers-as her thralls. Beneath the howling winds of the Eye of Abendego, hundreds of skum dwell in the ruins of Lirgen, now sunken beneath the sea. From this base, they make deals with both boggards and humans who have managed to survive in the flooded wastes of the Sodden Lands. These tribes and gangs provide Urtleytlar with slaves and food, and she strengthens their reach by aiding them in their destructive endeavors. In addition to these humanoids, Urtleytlar uses Megrexti, her charybdis counterpart and favorite plaything, as a living weapon, sending it into the middle of fleets of ships or other attackers and laughing in delight as it tears her victims to pieces.",
			"",
			"Urtleytlar chose as her alternate form a strangely beautiful Cyclops woman. As old a creature as she is, perhaps Urtleytlar feels a kinship with the giants who once ruled the land and waters she now calls home. Regardless, her alternate form has tricked many explorers searching for the ruins of Ghol-Gan, easing them into an odd complacency before she utterly destroys them and their crews.",
			"",
			"### Infamous Deeds",
			"",
			"Thriving within the dangerous force of the Eye of Abendego, the Tempest Queen gleefully besets any ship or fleet hoping to penetrate the storm. Many explorers in search of lost cities from Lirgen or ruins of ancient Ghol-Gan risk running across this wrathful creature.",
			"",
			"An insane, destructive whimsy marks Urtleytlar's behavior, and she delights in betrayal at the slightest offense. She leads some sailors safely through the storm for a time, then closes off the pockets of calm on the pitiful crew, leaving them to be ripped apart by the blistering winds and churning waters.",
			"",
			"According to the ship logs of the famed explorer Escobar Vellian, his last major encounter in the Sodden Lands was escaping the clutches of Urtleytlar. Assaulted by her fanatical skum minions and subjected to her numerous magical gambits, Vellian lost two ships during his attempts to escape, and returned to his home port with only one ship and less than one-fifth of his original crew.",
			"",
			"### Adventure Hooks",
			"",
			"Urtleytlar tends to find sailors before they find her, and those who purposefully seek out the legendary monster are regarded as mad.",
			"",
			"- Eager to acquire more power to further her course of destruction, Urtleytlar sends skum scouts to raid the underwater city of Wetan near the Sodden Lands. Once a port city of Lirgen, Wetan fell beneath the waves with the formation of the Eye of Abendego, and after the settlement's destruction, a tribe of locathah squatters sought the protection of its abandoned buildings. There they discovered an inoperable planetary gate and managed to partially activate it. Urtleytlar can sense the power and wants it for her own, despite not knowing exactly what she might gain.",
			"- Though Urtleytlar enjoys the caress of the Eye, she is hardly contained to one place, and her touch can be felt on the shores of the Shackles, the Sodden Lands, and Mediogalti Isle. Her destructive roaming causes especial trouble for the pirates of the Shackles, and a number of unlikely collaborators have settled their grudges, forming a pact to locate the dangerous scylla and kill her. Of course, with an endeavor like this, the pirates are eager for additional help."

			"In the ancient past, long before the rise of Azlant, during the near-mythical era known to scholars as the Age of Creation, two powerful demons met for the first time and descended to a world in the Material Plane to enjoy a short-lived but violently ardent dalliance in the mortal realm. The planet itself heaved and buckled before their blasphemous passions, thrusting upward to create a rasp-like ridge. The result of this vile union quickened much more quickly than a normal pregnancy, and the spawn of the two demons was birthed even as they continued their frolic. When the demons left the world, they left behind a landscape scarred by their coupling, and a just-whelped fiend of tremendous power and potential that slithered into a deep cave in the ridge to hide and grow.",
			"",
			"Certain rare texts on demonology maintain that these two demons were none other than Lamashtu and Pazuzu, and that not long after their meeting their lusts turned to hatred. Today, there is no greater enmity in all the Abyss than the hostility between those two demon lords, and both of their cults deny vehemently that such an encounter as described above could ever have taken place.",
			"",
			"And yet, the spawn of that union lived and grew, and in the Age of Anguish it emerged to conquer the Varisians even as they were beginning to recover from their slavery under Thassilon's rule and the devastation of Earthfall. This fiend was Uvaglor, a vrock who possessed a singular third eye in his brow that could see brief glimpses into the future. Uvaglor ruled the Varisians for many years until the desperate indigenous people invoked Lamashtu's aid in defeating the demon. The Mother of Monsters seemed eager to comply with this request, but as the battle against Uvaglor went on, her minions turned on the Varisians and attempted to destroy them as well. Only the heroics of a priestess of the empyreal lord Ashava, a woman named Sazzleru, saved the people from annihilation and liberated them from Lamashtu's influence while banishing Uvaglor from the Rasp into a nameless prison adrift deep in the Maelstrom.",
			"",
			"Uvaglor lives on still, but only recently managed to escape from the nameless prison to return to the Abyss. After gathering his power, he has turned his attention once again to the site of his conception-the Lost Coast of Varisia, formed when the land west of the Rasp fell into the sea. Already he has installed several of his agents, including a mysterious mothman priest known as the Red Bishop, but his actions have attracted the attention of others who would rule this region, and this time, greater eyes than those of mortals look down upon this building conflict. Lamashtu and Pazuzu's interest in the region cannot be denied, and their unknown ultimate plans, as well as Uvaglor's recent secret arrival in the region, portend dark times indeed.",
			"",
			"Uvaglor prefers offerings of fine art depicting imagery of Ashava, or of clerics of that empyreal lord-works of art the vrock enjoys befouling and destroying in increasingly creative methods. It's a DC 30 check to research the Misbegotten Prince."

			"Born nearly a century past, Valonesse barely survived her first months of life. At the time of her birth, much of the Kodar Mountains was suffering under a blanket of winter that had long overstayed its welcome. As many frost giants are wont to do in times of famine, the young giantess's clan had resorted to cannibalism. Valonesse's own father, the last reigning jarl of Thryheim, demanded her sacrifice to sate his hunger, but before his blade could still her heart, Valonesse's mother smuggled the babe away to live in exile. Her mother died several years after their escape, leaving Valonesse to fend for herself for the vast majority of her childhood and adolescence. When she finally came of age as a seasoned warrior and wanderer, the brutal frost giant returned to Thryheim to find the fortress of her ancestors in ruins and the fierce clan that had borne her whittled down to fewer than a dozen cowardly warriors. Her howls shook the walls, so enraged was she to find that the fickle hand of fate had snuffed out her dreams of murderous vengeance.",
			"",
			"Over the past decades, Valonesse has channeled her unappeased anger into the reestablishment of her forefathers' domain, claiming the title of jarl for her own. She claims to be the consort of Thremyr himself, given a divine mandate to see all of Stormflood Vale bow to her majesty. Though few trust the veracity of such a claim, fewer are those who would speak such doubts openly. Jarl Valonesse rules from Thryheim, an ancient ice fortress that rests high upon a glacial peak rich with untouched supplies of mithral and other rare ores. Though some challenged her right to rule in the early years of her fledgling empire, the period for contesting her reign has long passed-the scars that span her imposing body memorialize her countless victories, both in battle and against challengers seeking to claim her throne."

			"**Blasphemous Embrace (Ex)** If the Voice of the Damned grapples a foe, it can, as a swift action, cause its pages to flense the grappled creature. The pages deal the Voice of the Damned's swarm damage. If a creature takes any of this damage, it is subject to the swarm's distraction ability and must succeed at a DC 38 Fortitude saving throw or be nauseated for 1 round. The Voice can have only one embraced target at a time, but it doesn't have to continue grappling in order to maintain the embrace. If the Voice moves more than 5 feet from the pages or dismisses them (a free action), the pages are rendered inanimate. Any severe or stronger wind effect or any area attack that would damage a swarm ends the embrace.",
			"",
			"**Consume (Su)** If the Voice of the Damned begins its turn with an opponent in its blasphemous embrace, it can attempt a new combat maneuver check as though attempting to pin the opponent. If it succeeds, its foe takes swarm damage and vanishes into a nightmare realm within the Voice of the Damned. The target must be of Large size or smaller. The Voice of the Damned can't consume a creature that has the good subtype or that is affected by holy aura. A consumed creature takes 8d6 points of damage each round as it drifts within the Voice of the Damned's accumulated heresies. Nonevil creatures must also succeed at a DC 32 Will saving throw each round or be affected as per the spell insanity, though any creature that is deafened or affected by silence or a similar effect is immune to the insanity effect. The save DC is Charisma-based. Each round on its turn, a consumed creature can attempt a DC 20 Wisdom check as a full-round action. If the subject succeeds at this check on two consecutive turns, it escapes, emerging into a space adjacent to the Voice of the Damned. The Voice of the Damned cannot attempt to consume an escaped creature again until 24 hours have passed. A consumed creature can also escape by using plane shift or similar magic. The Voice of the Damned is stunned for 1 round and forced to expel all consumed creatures if a creature inside casts holy aura or summons a creature with the good subtype, or if a creature (either inside or out) targets the Voice of the Damned with atonement, freedom, or holy word. The Voice of the Damned can expel any consumed creature as a move action, causing the victim to appear in any square adjacent to it.",
			"",
			"**Discorporate (Su)** The Voice of the Damned can collapse into a cyclone of pages as a free action. All its carried, held, and worn items fall to the ground, and its Strength score drops to 1. The Voice functions as a swarm of Diminutive creatures while discorporated, with a reach of 0 feet (though its space remains unchanged). While discorporated, the Voice maintains its defensive abilities. It loses its claw, slam, and wing natural attacks, but it can make a swarm attack and use its spell-like abilities. The Voice of the Damned can reform into its true form as a full-round action as long as it has at least 1 hit point.",
			"",
			"**Malevolence (Su)** As an immediate action, the Voice of the Damned can attempt to merge its body with a creature it has consumed. This ability is similar to a magic jar spell (caster level 25th), except that it does not require a receptacle. The target can resist the attack with a successful DC 32 Will saving throw. If the creature fails, the Voice of the Damned vanishes and the possessed creature reappears in its space (along with any other creatures the Voice had consumed). A creature that successfully saves is immune to the Voice's malevolence for 24 hours. The save DC is Constitution-based.",
			"",
			"**Master of Symbols (Su)** The Voice of the Damned can speak, read, and write all languages, as per the spell tongues. It casts any spell with the word \"symbol\" in its name as though its casting time were a standard action, and once per day it can cast symbol of death as a swift action. Additionally, it does not need a surface on which to inscribe symbols-they merely float in the air for their duration.",
			"",
			"**Tenacious (Ex)** The Voice gains a +8 racial bonus on combat maneuver checks to grapple and a +4 racial bonus to its CMD.",
			"",
			"**Wracking Gaze (Su)** The Voice of the Damned has a gaze attack with a range of 50 feet that deals 8d10 points of damage and 1d4 points of Strength damage. A creature that succeeds at a DC 32 Fortitude saving throw negates the Strength damage but not the physical damage. The save DC is Constitution-based.",

			"No physical tome, no matter how magical, could ever hope to contain every facet of the multiverse's endless capacity for evil. Even if it could, the moment of the work's completion would also be the moment it became outdated. Realizing this, Tabris employed an audacious solution. He sacrificed a vestige of himself and locked it in the library-cathedrals hidden within the book's pages. These shades of Heaven's scribe were the embodiments of all he had learned of chaos, evil, good, and law, so they were perfectly suited to judge and record new developments across the planes.",
			"",
			"Yet this act, while fulfilling Tabris's charge to record all there is to know in the multiverse, also ensured his exile from Heaven. The celestial choirs simply could not accept their brother's decision to corrupt a piece of himself to create the entity they dubbed the Voice of the Damned, which serves as the Book of the Damned's hidden caretaker. When the Book of the Damned vanished from Heaven's Great Library, many took it as proof that the Voice might be even more dangerous than they'd imagined. And in the eons since, the Voice's knowledge, obsession, and power have only grown.",
			"",
			"The Voice of the Damned is a unique entity bound to the Book of the Damned's demiplane. It can never bodily leave that demiplane (except via its malevolence ability), and it always knows the location of every piece of the Book of the Damned. It seeks to guard the book, its repository, and the Unspeakable Word at the demiplane's center. As long as the Unspeakable Word is active, the Voice of the Damned cannot be slain for long; it resurrects 24 hours later. It can be permanently killed only if the Book of the Damned itself is destroyed."

As one of the multiverse's most prescient beings, Magdh is capable of seeing farther down the long lines of probability and fate than the norns themselves, and the triumvirate often takes on dangerous and enigmatic missions on Magdh's behalf.",

As happens to all norns who die outside the First World, Yrldak was reborn on her native plane, and is quickly growing while traversing Golarion looking for her sisters. Exhibiting the dark features of a reborn norn, whose hair and eyes lighten as they age, Yrldak is distinctive among her kind, and though her ebon hair reveals her still undeveloped power, Yrldak is a force to be reckoned with if any stand in her way or tempt fate in her presence. Eager to rejoin her sisters, Yrldak might seek the aid of adventurers, to whom she may promise wealth, prophecy, and other boons if they assist her in her quest."

As a free action, Ymeri can grant all of her allies with the fire subtype within 300 feet any two of her teamwork feats. Each creature retains these feats until it moves out of range or until Ymeri falls unconscious, dies, or uses this ability again.

Her sacred places and temples are often exposed desert ruins, sanctuaries of igneous rock, and shrines built precariously near active volcanoes. Some even feature active magma flows running through their halls or pits that open deep into the earth's burning bowels, which her cultists use to sacrifice their foes in Ymeri's name.",

			"",
			"**Bitter Flames (Su)** Whenever Zelishkar deals fire damage with any attack or effect, half of the damage is fire damage and the other half is untyped damage, similar to a flame strike spell. In addition, creatures that fail a save against any fire effect Zelishkar creates are sickened for 1 minute. Those damaged by his melee attacks or by fire effects that allow no save are instead sickened for 1 round per attack. This duration stacks.",
			"",
			"**Corpse Cremation (Su)** Whenever Zelishkar reduces a living creature to negative hit points, as a swift action he can turn its body to ashes and feed upon the target's life force, as death knell (Will DC 28 negates). Whenever Zelishkar slays a creature with any attack or ability, the creature's corpse is reduced to ashes (treat as disintegrate).",
			"",
			"**Daemonic Harbinger Traits (Su)** A [daemonic harbinger](family/daemonic_harbinger) is a powerful daemon that has not yet made the full transition from unique daemon to a horseman. It possesses several traits, as summarized here.",
			"",
			"- Immunity to acid, charm and compulsion effects, death effects, disease, and poison.",
			"- Resistance to cold 30, electricity 30, and fire 30.",
			"- Telepathy 300 feet.",
			"- The harbinger's natural weapons, as well as any weapon it wields, are treated as evil and lawful for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.",
			"- The harbinger can grant spells to its worshipers. Granting spells does not require any specific action on its behalf. Zelishkar grants access to the domains of [Evil](domain/evil), [Knowledge](domain/knowledge), [Magic](domain/magic) and [Trickery](domain/trickery). His favored weapon is the quarterstaff.",
			"",
			"**Incandescent Body (Su)** As a free action, Zelishkar can cause his body to erupt into white-hot flame. He sheds light as bright as a daylight spell, and dazzles any creature that does not avert its gaze. Creatures with the fire subtype are immune to this dazzling effect. Zelishkar can dim his flames to burning black shadows as a free action, suppressing the dazzling effect and allowing him to use Stealth without penalty.",
			"",
			"**Incendiary Grasp (Su)** If Zelishkar hits a target with more than one natural weapon in the same round, the fire damage from each hit is combined as if from a single attack for the purpose of overcoming effects that provide resistance to fire. In addition, if Zelishkar succeeds at a grapple combat maneuver, as a swift action he can suppress any fire resistance or immunity the target possesses until the beginning of Zelishkar's next turn. Creatures with the fire subtype are immune to this effect, unless that subtype is granted by a temporary magical effect or magic item.",
			"",
			"#### Description",
			"",
			"The dread Zelishkar of the Bitter Flame is a figure much feared on the crumbling plains of Abaddon and across the multiverse. A monstrous feline in shape but seemingly sculpted of lurid crimson flame, Zelishkar is girded with a crest and cuirass of infernally strengthened obsidian, shaved to razor thinness yet losing none of its terrible strength. His eyes are jet-black pits that mirror his armor, though pinpoints of awful orange radiance gleam deep within. He is surrounded always by a heat shimmer that diffuses his blinding radiance. Zelishkar is reputed to sense the presence of his prey by the tiniest variations in temperature, tracking the movements of creatures both seen and unseen before he pounces. His own fires burn with a hellish uncleanness, tainting even those who thought themselves proofed against his flames and rapidly consuming their body and soul, leaving nothing behind but befouled ashes.",
			"",
			"Zelishkar is feared as much for his incisive tactical acumen as for his dreadful and terrifying powers in close combat. He has single-handedly withered and despoiled cities and farmlands when summoned in the name of his daemonic mistress-Szuriel, patron of war and suffering. She forged Zelishkar's form in the deepest pits of the Cinder Furnace as her terrifying harbinger, embodying the hopeless misery of funeral pyres that consume and cremate the dead in the wake of the war that she brings. He proved so adept that she judged him worthy to transcend his purpose, and he has come to embody all of the hateful and sadistic purposes that fire serves. His name is invoked now by torturers and inquisitors alike as they consign their hapless captives to the ultimate agonies of being burned alive, and even by arsonists both petty and grand. All twisted souls who love nothing more than to see the world burn offer up silent praises to Zelishkar in their hearts; even if they never speak his name, the hate that burns within them is a sweet savor in his nostrils.",
			"",
			"Zelishkar was summoned to Golarion in ancient times, during the height of Osirion's empire, and he led legions of flaming minions against the enemies of the Pharaoh of Forgotten Plagues, notably the Jistka Imperium. In a twist of supreme hubris, the Pharaoh of Forgotten Plagues turned against his summoned ally after several successful campaigns, and chose Zelishkar to be the test subject of his grandest experiment yet. The Osirian king had just finished construction of a grand labyrinth south of the Alamein Peninsula, and in a display of prideful foolishness ordered Zelishkar to be imprisoned within to prove the infallibility of his maze. It took the efforts of an entire army of summoned genies to lock the daemonic harbinger away beneath the desert's churning sands, but his imprisonment was absolute with the aid of an ancient efreeti and a legendary artifact known as the Bottle of the Bound.",
			"",
			"Through all the long millennia since, Zelishkar and the remnant of his host have remained imprisoned beneath the Labyrinth of Shiman-Sekh, the city founded by the Song Pharaoh upon her victory over the Pharaoh of Forgotten Plagues years after Zelishkar's detention. He has emerged from his prison but once, when Szuriel and the ironically named Incorruptible Pharaoh joined to loose his fiery fury upon one of the sky-cities of Shory. His destructive rampage could not be contained, however, and he devastated several cities and oases of western Osirion before he and his host were finally bound back within their prison. There he remains, plotting burning vengeance upon Osirion and all of Golarion for his ages of durance vile."
