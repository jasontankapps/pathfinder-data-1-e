Each charm of aluum control is attuned to a single, specific aluum, but the magic of the charm allows it to function somewhat against other aluums as well. Against its specific attuned aluum, the charm grants you the ability to command that construct as if you were using dominate person on a humanoid creature. This effect functions against other aluums, but non-attuned aluums gain a DC 16 Will save to resist the effect. If an aluum fails such a save, it becomes attuned to that charm and the previous aluum becomes unattuned-a single charm of aluum control can only be attuned to one aluum at a time. For purposes of this effect, ordering an aluum to attack a Pactmaster or someone who appears to be part of Katapesh's government or army or to damage any structure in the city of Katapesh counts as an action against the aluum's nature and allows the aluum a new saving throw with a +2 bonus to resist the charm's effects.

			"Slave collars are popular items among drow, duergar, and other Darklands societies that require obedience and servitude from slave castes. As these collars are relatively costly, they are typically reserved for use on particularly powerful or desirable slaves. A slave collar consists of a simple ring of metal (typically brass or bronze) that latches in place with a lock. Many feature additional adornments like short lengths of chain. Each slave collar's lock is attuned to a unique key. The person who carries a collar's key is aware of that collar's wearer as if it were the target of a constant status spell. In addition, the key carrier can communicate telepathically with the wearer of the collar as long as the wearer is within 100 feet of her. As long as a slave collar is worn, that collar's key carrier automatically penetrates the collar wearer's spell resistance (if any), and the collared creature takes a -5 penalty on all saving throws against the key carrier's spells. A slave collar's lock can be picked with a successful DC 40 Disable Device check, or broken open with a successful DC 30 Strength check-either method immediately destroys the slave collar. The wearer of a slave collar takes a -10 penalty on Disable Device or Strength checks made to disable the slave collar it wears.",

			"Riffle scrolls are somewhat heavier than normal scrolls; a single riffle scroll weighs 1 pound. Each riffle scroll has an AC of 9, 5 hit points, hardness 0, and a break DC of 10. Riffle scrolls cannot be kept in standard scroll tubes; they are normally transported in flat leather cases or boxes similar to containers used to transport books.",
			"",
			"Riffle scrolls can be created by any spellcaster who has the [Scribe Scroll](feat/scribe_scroll) and Silent Spell feats. Scribing a riffle scroll is more time-consuming and expensive than scribing normal scrolls because of the greater number of pages and more complex magic involved. A riffle scroll's market price is equal to the spell level &times; the caster's level &times; 25 gp-but note that only spells that have been modified by the Silent Spell metamagic feat can be crafted into riffle scrolls. This affects the spell's effective spell level for the purposes of determining the riffle scroll's price. Effectively, a riffle scroll costs about the same as a normal scroll of one spell level higher. This also means that 9th-level spells cannot be made into riffle scrolls, because there are no 10th-level spell slots. Abilities that reduce the level adjustment of the Silent Spell feat do not affect riffle scrolls.",

Scribing a riffle scroll takes 1 day for each 1,000 gp in its base price, with a minimum of 1 day of work.

			"A recondite holy symbol is a silver amulet depicting an old or obscure religious symbol that has long fallen out of common use within the religion in question. Each religion has its own unique obsolete emblems, but older religions are likely to have a greater variety of emblems than newer religions. For example, a recondite holy symbol of Desna might depict a single shining star (as she was sometimes depicted in ancient Azlant) or a silhouetted woman astride an elk (as she is depicted by ancient Kellid tradition), rather than her common butterfly symbol. A successful DC 15 Knowledge (religion) check is required to identify the deity or religion associated with a recondite holy symbol, allowing the wielder to utilize the holy symbol without identifying her faith to the uninformed. When the wielder uses an appropriate recondite holy symbol to channel energy, she gains a +3 competence bonus on Knowledge (religion) checks related to her deity or religion for 1 minute.",

The user may apply the [Extend Spell](feat/extend_spell) feat to these spells as they are cast. This does not change the spell slot of the altered spell. The book counts as a metamagic rod for the purpose of combining multiple metamagic effects on a spell. A normal book of extended summoning can be used with spells of 6th level or lower, while a lesser book can be used with spells of 3rd level or lower, and a greater book can be used with spells of 9th level or lower. Each book is keyed to a particular alignment (equal chances of chaotic, evil, good, or lawful) and only works when used to summon a creature with that alignment. Once the book is used, it crumbles into cold ash and is destroyed.",

A goblet holds up to 1 cup of liquid (or 1 dose of a magic potable, such as a potion), and no matter how it is held or shaken, it never spills a drop, except down the throat of a willing drinker. A neverspill goblet does not dispense its contents for someone unwilling to drink from it. The magic of the goblet also keeps fluids from accidentally entering the goblet. This does not prevent poisoning (since the poisoner's addition is intentional), but means if a neverspill goblet is placed underwater and removed, its original contents remain undiluted. It is therefore possible to drink a potion from a neverspill goblet while underwater. Most neverspill goblets are made from light, portable materials such as wood or pewter, or come in larger sizes. Its magical nature does not prevent it from corrosion by acid. Liquids placed in a neverspill goblet do not succumb to the ravages of temperature or time, a fact that more than one adventurer has taken advantage of on journeys.",
