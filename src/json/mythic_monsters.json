Choose one of the anunnaki's skills; for the next 24 hours the target of this ability uses the anunnaki's skill ranks in place of its own, even if this is more than its maximum number of ranks. A creature can't benefit from this ability more than once at the same time. If an anunnaki uses this ability on a creature that is currently the target of bestow knowledge (from itself or another anunnaki), the new bestow knowledge effect replaces the older one. The anunnaki has the following skill ranks: Bluff 10 ranks, Diplomacy 15 ranks, Fly 15 ranks, Heal 20 ranks, Intimidate 15 ranks, Knowledge (arcana, local, nature) 20 ranks, Knowledge (dungeoneering, engineering, history) 8 ranks, Knowledge (geography, planes, religion) 5 ranks, Linguistics 15 ranks, Perception 20 ranks, Sense Motive 11 ranks, and Spellcraft 20 ranks. Devolution (Su) As a standard action, an anunnaki can touch a creature and cause it to permanently lose cognitive function. The creature touched must succeed at a DC 28 Will save or be affected by an effect similar to feeblemind that can be removed only by a wish or miracle. If a creature affected by devolution procreates, its children can't have an Intelligence or Charisma score higher than 2 naturally, nor can this effect be lifted by magic. Progeny created with this affliction also possess physical traits that were more common among earlier evolutionary forms of their parent species. The save DC is Charisma-based. Lantern of Civilization (Su) An anunnaki's lantern of civilization grants it constant true seeing and powers its primal chisel. If it loses its lantern of civilization, it loses both of these abilities. Mimetic Memory (Ex) As a standard action, an anunnaki can touch a willing creature to read and imprint upon that creature's genetic memory as if both the anunnaki and its target were affected by a share thoughts spell. Morphic Anatomy (Ex) Anunnaki are adept shapechangers and can shift their internal anatomy to best suit their immediate needs. This ability renders them immune to critical hits, sneak attacks, and precision damage. Morphic Body (Ex) An anunnaki can assume the appearance of any creature within one size category of itself (other than creatures with the elemental, incorporeal, or swarm subtypes-the body assumed must be solid). The anunnaki's creature type doesn't change in this new form, and it gains none of the mimicked creature's special abilities; the transformation is cosmetic only. In these other forms, the anunnaki retains all of its normal statistics and abilities as noted above, though it does take the appropriate bonuses and penalties based on its new size. Though this ability affects only the anunnaki's outward appearance, it is a transmutation effect. Primal Chisel (Su) An anunnaki's primal chisel is a part of the creature, and is powered by its lantern of civilization. It is a masterwork one-handed piercing weapon that deals 3d6 points of damage with an 18-20 critical threat range, and a successful attack made with it applies the anunnaki's devolution ability. Psychic Warding (Su) An anunnaki generates a field of psychic energy around its body that protects its mind and body from harm, granting it a deflection bonus to its Armor Class and a racial bonus on saving throws against mind-affecting effects equal to its Charisma modifier. Uplift (Su) As a full-round action, an anunnaki can impart incredible capacity for thought and understanding to a creature it touches. The creature must have an Intelligence score of 3 or less to be affected by this ability. This affect is identical to awaken, except that it works on creatures of the animal, plant, humanoid, magical beast, and monstrous humanoid types. Creatures affected by uplift don't change creature type (with the exception of animals, which become magical beasts), nor does the affected creature have any inherent affinity toward the anunnaki. The effect of uplift is permanent and is passed on to any progeny the uplifted creature produces." ],
			"description": [ "Residents of an enigmatic and unknown world that is believed to exist out of phase with the Material Plane, anunnaki are mysterious, god-like beings that shape the very direction of civilizations. Little is known about the anunnaki homeworld, but fragmented information collected by scholars indicates that it comes into contact with the Material Plane only once every few thousand years. During this time, anunnaki travel to other worlds in order to manipulate the course of evolution, creating civilizations and uplifting primitive creatures using their esoteric technology, which includes external power sources called \"lanterns of civilization.\" The anunnaki do not typically remain to guide these societies, and are often remembered as deities by the civilizations they leave behind. Because the anunnaki can take on various forms, piecing together which civilizations have or haven't been visited by anunnaki is exceedingly difficult. The creatures could have arrived to guide one civilization in the guise of powerful, glowing creatures and secretly assimilated into another society by adopting the appearance of members of that society and subtly making changes over the course of decades. Each anunnaki calibrates its form to fit the mores and prejudices of the specific society it means to advance. Anunnaki's role as manipulators of civilization and natural order often puts them into direct confrontation with elohim. The source of the enmity between these mighty creatures is unknown, but the aftershocks of their conflicts can be felt for millennia after the fighting has ended. Some sages believe that the anunnaki and elohim are both working to circumvent some future calamity, but differ along ideological or philosophical lines as to how to prevent this event from coming to pass. Ancient records from cultures that were shaped by the anunnaki reference divine visions of great, devouring rifts in the darkness between the stars and the terrible, unimaginable entities that dwell within them. For all the knowledge and power anunnaki possess, the civilizations they create do not always see them as benevolent saviors. Some anunnaki might have more sinister agendas not shared by the rest of their people. These rogue anunnaki have free rein over the societies they manipulate as long as they can avoid the notice of their fellow anunnaki-and since it is difficult for other creatures to find or contact any of their race, the renegade anunnaki can often do whatever they please. Some of these renegades use their civilizations for large-scale experiments, creating bizarre hybrid creatures. Others advance their subjects too rapidly by the standards of the other anunnaki, attempting to create creatures as advanced as the anunnaki themselves rather than simply giving cultures the means to advance themselves. In many of these cases, the uplifted society isn't truly equipped to handle such vast changes. Rather than advancing in a surge of scientific and creative thought, its members become absorbed with existential doubt or fall into madness as they recognize the gulf between their lofty ambitions and the materials and means they have at their disposal. Anunnaki prefer to interact with most humanoids without being recognized for what they are, and an anunnaki may depart a conversation abruptly if a non-anunnaki reveals that she knows it is not the god or mortal it pretends to be." ],

				"For perhaps a thousand years, the imperial phalanxes of Ninshabur conquered and controlled immense swaths of Casmaron. The independent state of Praramdav, one of many kingdoms that would later consolidate to form Vudra, watched Ninshabur's rise to power with growing discomfort. Its rulers began building its armies to repel the seemingly inevitable invasion, but in -632 ar, the Tarrasque emerged from the Pit of Gormuz in central Casmaron and laid waste to Ninshabur.",
				"",
				"Rather than rejoicing at the news of his rival's demise, the rajah of Praramdav feared that a Spawn of Rovagug might visit the same cataclysm upon his kingdom. He issued incentives of wealth and power to lure the brightest minds to his capitol; hundreds of sages answered his call and concluded that only a comparably large guardian could repel a Spawn's attack. Pointing to Rovagug's destructive power, the scholars informed the rajah that only the purest, most infallible and incorruptible material would do: gold.",
				"",
				"With study and divination revealing no weakness to the Tarrasque, the rajah desperately clung to the idea of a powerful golden guardian and turned his powerful army against his other neighbors in order to fund this ambitious construct. Within 5 years, the form of the colossus was complete, a dozen kingdoms were under the rajah's control, and a great army-known as the Gilded Host-stood ready to fight alongside its golden champion. Despite the construct's tremendous might, further divination determined that the Champion of the Gilded Host was still incapable of defeating a Spawn of Rovagug. The rajah continued to spend money to improve the construct, unwilling to abandon a weapon that had already consumed such vast resources. However, the Tarrasque never came.",
				"",
				"Without a great victory to justify its leader's aggressive policies and reckless spending, Praramdav was unable to hold onto its new territory. It collapsed into bankruptcy, and its vassal kingdoms attempted in vain to melt down the colossus but succeeded only in breaking it into five virtually invulnerable sections: two arms, the head, the torso, and its articulated serpentine tail. A different kingdom claimed each one as spoils of Praramdav's folly. Nearly a millennium later, these same kingdoms had managed to reunite three of the pieces when Unyielding Kothogaz arrived in Vudra, but the Spawn of Rovagug attacked and scattered the pieces far and wide in its rampage. Ultimately, it was not a golden champion but an army of hero-priests that defeated Kothogaz."

Each day she can produce any number of creatures whose combined total base CR does not exceed 3 + her Constitution modifier (usually 21).",
				"",
				"**Gestation Aura (Su)** A drakainia's aura pulses with developing life. All poisons or diseases active within her 30-foot aura have an onset of 1 round and a frequency of 1/minute. Impregnated creatures within her aura gestate in 2d4 rounds. Any creature born within her aura gains a mutation as if it were the drakainia's spawn, though if the creature's parent was not impregnated by the drakainia, the creature born is an infant of the kind its biological parents would produce, and doesn't count toward the CR limit the drakainia can spawn per day.",
				"",
				"**Impregnate Surrogate (Su)** A drakainia can disgorge a monstrous embryo into the mouth of a living, corporeal creature that is pinned or helpless. She makes a grapple combat maneuver check, and if she succeeds she impregnates that creature regardless of its gender. A mythic character must succeed at a DC 38 Fortitude saving throw to avoid being impregnated; a non-mythic character is impregnated automatically. An impregnated creature's pregnancy lasts for 2d4 rounds. During this pregnancy, the victim is nauseated until the monster bursts forth from the victim's abdomen, which deals 10d6 points of damage to the pregnant creature and applies the broken condition to any armor it is wearing.",
				"",
				"Remove disease (DC 28) eliminates the unnatural embryo. Alternatively, as a full-round action another creature can attempt to cut out the growing monster with a DC 38 Heal check. On a successful check, the offspring is removed, and the formerly pregnant creature takes 1d4 points of bleed damage. On failed check, the pregnant creature takes 2d6 points of bleed damage and is stunned for 1 round, but the offspring is not removed. The creature spawned by means of this impregnation is any creature of the drakainia's choice that is at least one size category smaller than the creature she impregnated. These spawn count against the drakainia's daily CR allowance for birth spawn (see above).",
				"",
				"**Invert Birth (Su)** When a drakainia uses her dimension door spell-like ability, instead of the normal range, she can choose to teleport to any space occupied by one of her spawn that is within 1 mile of her. She doesn't need line of sight or knowledge of the spawn's location. If she chooses a spawn that is farther than a mile away, she does not lose the use of the spell-like ability, but does lose the action. On arrival, she explodes out from her offspring, destroying it entirely.",
				"",
				"**Polymorphism (Ex)** The spawn gestating inside the drakainia constantly alter her internal construction, making her immune to bleed, disease, poison, and polymorph effects. When she is subject to a critical hit or a sneak attack, this polymorphism grants her a 75% chance of negating such attacks.",
				"",
				"**Razor Claws (Ex)** A drakainia's claws are razor sharp with a critical threat range of 17-20 and a critical multiplier of x4.",
				"",
				"**Transfer Suffering (Su)** As a swift action, a drakainia can transfer a single harmful spell effect or condition from herself to one of her offspring that is currently within her gestation aura.",
				"",
				"**Well of Life (Su)** A drakainia can unleash the primal life energy within in her body to channel positive energy as if she were a 20th-level cleric (DC 35). She can use this ability 18 times per day and can choose to expend 1 use of mythic power at each use to maximize the damage healed."

			"description": [
				"Hailed as either protectors or plagues, glaistigs are ancient fey, tied to the earth and wielding its powers. Although not evil, glaistigs are unpredictable and hot-tempered-easily stirred to anger and possessing powerful magic to deal great harm to the objects of their scorn.",
				"",
				"A glaistig resembles a comely human woman with greenish skin and the lower legs of a goat, similar to a faun or satyr. Glaistigs usually cover their bestial lower body in flowing robes or gowns, typically woven from leaves frozen in the colors of summer or autumn, and adorn themselves with simple but elegant jewelry. Their haunting eyes show no pupils, and every step they take seems as one move in an endless dance. They can be whimsical, but often move and act with great deliberation, especially when their anger is roused.",
				"",
				"Glaistigs are among the oldest and most powerful fey in existence. Legends say that they were once incorporeal spirits of the earth that strove to protect early humans living the simple lives of farmers in harsh worlds, and it was through that protection and proximity that these spirits coalesced into the forms they now hold. Regardless of their origins, many glaistigs still protect swaths of rural countryside, forests, and swamps, as well as the people who live therein. Their protection is often unobtrusive; they prefer to manifest their power and protection from the camouf lage of foliage, making it seem like the wilderness itself is acting against interlopers. In times of great need, however, or when they become very angry, glaistigs confront dangers in the open. Inhabitants of places protected by a glaistig often leave food, drink, jewels, and crafts at a designated place of honor, or gather to sing songs or tell tales for the glaistig to hear from the shadows. Such communities tell stories of the green maiden who lives in the forest or some other stretch of pristine wilderness, and relate a number of cautionary tales about their fickle protector. Such tales have twofold purpose: to keep the favor of a local glaistig and to protect the young and foolish from doing something that angers the green maiden, which can often mean death. In return for such cautious reverence, those under the elder fey's protection often find furrows dug and earth mysteriously moved for them, troughs and barrels filled with fresh water during droughts, or even marauding monsters driven far away. But such harmony is often tenuous, and those that leave tribute for a glaistig do so as much to placate her as to praise her. For the same glaistig that brings water and turns earth can blight an entire countryside or cause the ground to tremble. A glaistig's mere presence can incite others to uncontrollable fits of dancing and demented antics, and those that move a glaistig to rage earn themselves a powerful foe indeed.",
				"",
				"In combat, a glaistig moves with ease and grace, typically targeting those under the effects of her aura with debilitating hexes before withdrawing to summon earth elementals to aid her, and bombarding her opponents with leaves and dirt. The living link of her body to the earth and its plants and trees makes a glaistig vulnerable in the air, and she does what she can to stay grounded. Even at the height of anger, however, a glaistig can still sometimes be reasoned with. A glaistig will typically pause to parley, and can be swayed to cease hostilities in exchange for some valuable, preferably magical, item of sufficient value, particularly a wooden or stone item. While glaistigs themselves have no compunction about bending the truth or flagrantly dissembling, they take extreme offense when others lie to them, and are quite adept at sniffing out falsehoods. When a glaistig deduces that someone has lied to her, even if the untruths were spoken in an attempt at flattery, her outrage is such that she is unwilling to even speak with that person again.",
				"",
				"Among some of the most prevalent cautionary tales involving glaistigs is that they sometimes lure young children deep into their wilderness homes, kidnapping them and even replacing them with some form of fey impostor. In truth, these fey enjoy the innocence, honesty, and playfulness of children, and usually keep them only to chat and dance with for a short while before sending them home unharmed."

Final expressions of enlightenment, these incredibly powerful entities have guided the development of all life for countless eons.

Scholars generally believe that the solar pitris serve as masters to a number of twilight pitris, and sometimes even various manus, but the exact relationships seem to have a degree of f luidity-as some esoteric texts insist that this group of manasaputras serve Ksathras, the Dominion, while others claim the same group or members of that group serve Ameuritati, the First Immortal. Many of these contradictions stem from transcription mistakes in ancient texts or issues with the variety of spellings or even names by which some kumaras are known, but others can be explained only by shifts in the structure of the manasaputra caste system over the eons.",
				"",
				"The lore regarding the relationship between the solar pitris and mortal races is less muddled. Most stories relate that at the dawn of creation, solar pitris took pity on misguided mortals, who were confused by the teachings and guidance given to them by the twilight pitris. The twilight pitris' nurturing led to overly rational mortals who lacked the compassion and empathy necessary for true enlightenment. The solar pitris intervened, and granted those wayward mortals a favored place in the cycle of cosmic reincarnation. Scholars speculate that this act on the part of the solar pitris was the first step that led to the evolution of samsarans, though many samsarans deny this story, instead insisting that they are early forms of what will later become the next wave of manasaputras.",
				"",
				"Because of their unfathomably ancient minds and farreaching plans, solar pitris rarely interact with other creatures. They must restrain their power, lest their very presence prove deadly to other living beings. Solar pitris are creatures of fire, and even witnessing a solar pitri shifting from corporeality to incorporeality from afar can blind mortals. Creatures that come close to a solar pitri are scorched by the outsider's boundless, radiant energies. Adherents of some cults attempt such approaches regardless of the danger, believing that even if they burn to death, their souls will be purified by the solar pitri's presence. Most of what is known about solar pitris comes from the teachings handed down to mortals by lesser manasaputras, the traditions of those samsarans who believe that they are connected to manasaputras (or even that they are some early form of manu), the often wild and fanciful speculation of occult thinkers, the feverish dreams of eccentric mystics, and the few legitimate historical accounts of the various kumaras leaving their contemplation within the Cosmic Fire and interacting with mortals. But even then, only monumental events such as mass extinctions of whole worlds, the death of gods, the eradication of an entire intelligent species, or other reality-shaking events draw solar pitris' attention. Otherwise, their time is spent pondering unknowable truths and guiding other manasaputras from deep within the heart of the Positive Energy Plane."

				"",
				"**Bonded Harbor (Ex)** When on the Material Plane, a portunus attunes itself to a natural bay, fjord, or inlet.

To receive the boon, a character must perform a 1-minute ritual in or adjacent to the portunus's bonded harbor and succeed at a DC 21 Knowledge (nature) check. The ritual fails if the portunus is not in its harbor or if it has an attitude of unfriendly or hostile to the supplicant. If the ritual is a success, the character can call upon this boon once within the next 24 hours to roll twice on a skill check and take the better result. A character cannot benefit from more than one boon at a time and cannot attempt this check more than once per day. Granting a boon requires no action by the portunus, and there is no limit on the number of boons it can grant.",
				"",
				"**Capsize (Ex)** A portunus can attempt to capsize a boat or ship by ramming it as a charge attack and attempting a combat maneuver check. The DC of this check is 25 or equal to the result of the boat captain's Profession (sailor) check, whichever is higher. For each size category the ship is larger than the portunus, the portunus takes a cumulative -10 penalty on this combat maneuver check.

The portunus can end this ability as a standard action.",

			"habitat": [
				"On their native plane, portunuses are most often found where the Plane of Water borders other planes, playing among the storms where it meets the Plane of Air or hiding within the chasms where it meets the Plane of Earth. Large chunks of other elements floating in the endless sea might also contain hollows where portunuses dwell. On the Material Plane, each portunus is bound to a specific natural harbor, which serves as a link to its home plane. A portunus can leave its bonded harbor, but these excursions are infrequent and usually short. Though they might be found along any coast, portunuses are most common in regions with many inlets, especially the sunken continent of Azlant, the many islands of Iblydos, and the fjords of the Lands of the Linnorm Kings.",
				"",
				"Portunuses serve as protectors of their harbors and the creatures that live there. While they may be initially wary of humanoids making use of their harbors, most portunuses come to view them as just another part of the bay's ecosystem, as long as the humanoids are respectful of nature."
			],
			"description": [
				"Portunuses are a kind of water elemental who inhabit natural harbors. They embody both the regular rising and falling of the tides and the inconstant shifting of the weather. Humanoids who live along bays inhabited by portunuses often revere them as genii loci, and they may give prayers and offerings to the elementals in hopes that their ship will come in-whether literally or figuratively. A portunus is naturally invisible underwater, but when it chooses to be seen, it resembles a translucent, statuesque humanoid with four arms and two faces. The portunus's faces can be the same or different genders. They move about the elemental's head independently, sometimes facing in opposite directions and at other times cheek to cheek. The portunus can sense and speak from either or both faces, though it has a single mind.",
				"",
				"When standing, a portunus towers nearly 24 feet tall and weighs around 12,000 pounds.",
				"",
				"Portunuses are rarely seen, even by those who live along the harbors where they dwell. A portunus shows its approval by granting its boon and by using its spell-like abilities to provide unseen aid. If humanoids don't give the proper respect to its harbor, a portunus shows its displeasure with subtle acts of sabotage, such as causing small leaks in ships or rusting away anchor chains. Only if these hints are ignored does the portunus resort to more destructive magic. A portunus revealing its true form is a sign that momentous events are occurring. The portunus may do so to punish a spellcaster who offends the gods or to defend its harbor-and its pious residents-from a disaster or invasion. Rarely, a portunus may reveal itself to a fellow servant of nature or fate in order to provide information or assistance.",
				"",
				"Portunuses are pious creatures who revere deities of the sea and weather and deities of luck and fate. Indeed, many portunuses consider themselves agents of these gods, even if they are not part of any formal structure. Portunuses of the Inner Sea region point to Gozreh's two faces or Pharasma's affinity for the element of water as proof of their divine connections. Portunuses consider it their duty to keep watch over those who employ magic to alter tides, winds, or luck to ensure they use their powers judiciously and with humility. A spellcaster who abuses or becomes reliant on such magic risks being attacked by a portunus for his hubris. Particularly strong magic may even draw portunuses from their harbors to investigate.",
				"",
				"Portunuses do not actively seek out treasure, but over the years, they may accumulate a hoard from the offerings tossed into their harbor by supplicants and the lost cargo of ships that sink nearby. Even so, those who attempt to salvage a portunus's treasure find their efforts stymied by the unseen elemental. Yet, a portunus is sometimes willing to give some of its treasure to those in need. Such recipients may never know who their benefactor is, as these gifts appear to be merely washed up on the beach."

For this reason, some philosophers suggest shen are creatures of balance seeking to maintain the natural order. They bring about an early thaw to a harsh winter or destroy creatures preying on local villages to return everything to a state of balance. Regardless of what their motivations are, most people fear and respect them. More often than not, unusual good or bad fortune is attributed to shen.",

These castles are often huge, encompassing dozens of empty rooms bedecked in illusory silks and gold, opulent dining halls outf itted with phantasmal furniture, and massive antechambers illuminated by simulated chandeliers. No one understands exactly why these creatures choose to model their mirage homes after human dwellings, and often the surface resemblance only serves to further confuse and befuddle visitors.",

Because of this and out of fear for the great beasts, local peoples give shen considerable reverence, and pay the dragons tribute with sacrifices or treasure."

			"description": [
				"Chained for eons beneath the deepest waves of the endless seas, danavas are the eldest and first of the great outsiders collectively known as titans. Conceived originally at the foundation of reality to govern and regulate the mercurial forces that shaped the cosmos, danavas ultimately proved too harsh, too rigid, and too unf linching for their mission. Finally, when the danavas went to war with their chaotic and less powerful brethren, the gods interceded before creation was rent asunder, placing their elder children in stasis beneath the waves, buried at the cruxes of many worlds.",
				"",
				"Danavas resemble thick-even rotund-but extremely muscular humans of incredible size. Reaching heights of 75 to 100 feet, danavas can weigh up to 200 tons. Their ancient ornamentations cover most of their red-brown skin, and their helmets always reveal their wagon-wheelsized, pupilless eyes.",
				"",
				"Since the time of their imprisonment, the danavas have seldom emerged from beneath the waves. When freed from its sequestration, a danava surfaces in an attempt to restore balance to the world, whether through the raising of an elder god, perhaps devastating a race of humanoids on the brink of a destructive discovery or crushing the unchecked hubris of their own lesser kin. And although danavas focus singularly on their targets, they coldly and ruthlessly dispatch enemies attempting to thwart that goal, raining down lightning and laying waste to entire cities, wreaking fearsome havoc that becomes the stuff of legends. In combat, the titans typically use their massive brawn in conjunction with its mythic resilience to outlast enemies, saving their spell-like abilities for specific targets that pose a greater danger.",
				"",
				"While the forces that release danavas into the world are mysterious, the great outsiders function with autonomy. If a danava's fury is successfully checked or resisted, the creature can be reasoned with. Typically, the titan divulges its charge and purpose, and explains the need for its actions, but without looking for pardon or expressing remorse. Danavas see the absolutes of the universe and rarely appreciate complexity or nuance. While danavas are usually lawful neutral, some lawful good and lawful evil danavas do exist. Lawful good danavas endeavor to cause the minimum necessary destruction to achieve their goals. Once they have righted whatever imbalance they were released to fix, danavas return to the fathomless depths until again no living memory of them remains.",
				"",
				"Danava Pillar",
				"",
				"Certain danavas have, over the eons, merged with the cruxes of the universe they oversee. These danava pillars are more powerful than normal, and destroying one would be a step toward unraveling reality itself, so they are targets for creatures like the hundun, who wish to destroy entire dimensions. Danava pillars are always 10th mythic rank, and they vary from CR 25 to 30. This increase comes from templates like the advanced simple template, class levels, or both. Each danava pillar gains a unique ability from its connection to the fundamental linchpins of the universe, including (but not limited to) the following.",
				"",
				"Akashic Guru (Ex): The danava pillar is connected to the Akashic Record. It gains a +20 racial bonus on all Knowledge checks, and it can expend 1 point of mythic power to recall its previous self from the Akashic Record without spending an action. If it does so, it is restored to full hit points, regains all uses of its spell-like abilities, and loses all conditions and spells currently affecting it (beneficial or detrimental); it does not regain any uses of mythic power. Since the ability does not require an action, the danava pillar can use this ability even when it can't take actions, as the universe itself attempts to prevent the threatened destruction of the pillar.",
				"",
				"Temporal Lord (Ex): The danava pillar is connected to the Dimension of Time, and its multidimensional existence doesn't connect or relate to time in the same way as a typical creature's. Each round, just before its normal actions, the danava pillar benefits from effects identical to those of the spell time stop (though this isn't a spell effect). It doesn't spend an action to do so-this is simply a natural consequence of its nonlinear experience of time.",
				"",
				"Yin and Yang (Ex): The danava pillar is connected to the Positive and Negative Energy Planes and the transmigration of souls. Both positive and negative energy heal the pillar (whether channeled to heal or to harm), and it can channel positive and negative energy at will once per round each as a free action. The channeled energy's effect is as a 20th-level cleric's. The danava pillar gains Selective Channeling as a bonus feat. Finally, a creature reduced to 0 hit points or below by any of the danava pillar's attacks is instantly reincarnated into its next life. Unlike the spell reincarnate, this transforms the creature into an infant with no class levels and little or no memory of its former life. Restoring the original creature from its new incarnation requires a miracle, a wish, or similar magic, and as doing so simultaneously eliminates the new incarnation, it could have profound moral or ethical implications for the restorer."
