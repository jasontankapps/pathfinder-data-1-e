			"- Resistance to electricity 10 and fire 10.",
			"- **Envisaging (Su):** Aeons communicate wordlessly, almost incomprehensibly. Caring little for the wants and desires of other creatures, they have no need to engage in exchanges of dialogue. Instead, aeons mentally scan beings for their thoughts and intentions, and then retaliate with flashes of psychic projections that emit a single concept in response to whatever the other being was thinking. The flash is usually a combination of a visual and aural stimulation, which displays how the aeon perceives future events might work out. For instance, an aeon seeking to raze a city communicates this concept to non-aeons by sending them a vivid image of the city crumbling to ash. An aeon's envisaging functions as a nonverbal form of telepathy. Aeons cannot read the thoughts of any creature immune to mind-affecting effects.",
			"- **Extension of All (Ex):** Through an aeon's connection to the multiverse, it gains access to strange and abstruse knowledge that filters through all existence. Much of the knowledge is timeless, comprising events long past, present, and potentially even those yet to come. Aeons gain a racial bonus equal to 1/2 their racial Hit Dice on all Knowledge checks. This same connection also binds them to other aeons. As a result, they can communicate with each other freely over great distances as if using telepathy. This ability also works across planes, albeit less effectively, allowing the communication of vague impressions or feelings, not specific details or sights. Due to the vast scope of the aeon race's multiplanar concerns, though, even the most dire reports of a single aeon rarely inspire dramatic or immediate action.",
			"- **Void Form (Su):** Though aeons aren't incorporeal, their forms are only a semi-tangible manifestation of something greater. An aeon's void form grants it a deflection bonus equal to 1/4 its Hit Dice (rounded down)."

Within its favored terrain, a blight gains a +2 bonus on initiative checks and on Knowledge (geography), Perception, Stealth, and Survival checks. A blight in its favored terrain leaves no trail and cannot be tracked (although it can choose to leave a trail). Outside of its favored terrain, a blight loses access to its domain of evil, rejuvenation, spell-like abilities, and telepathy; it also gains the staggered condition.",
			"- **Cursed Domain (Su):** Blights are living epicenters for domains of evil. Once per year, a blight may infuse an area of its favored terrain, transforming it into a domain of evil with a radius of 5 miles (this effect does not extend beyond the natural border of the terrain). The epicenter of the domain can be identified via detect evil, for it radiates an aura of overwhelming evil in a 10-foot-radius. The epicenter of a blight's domain may be targeted by a remove curse effect to temporarily lift this affliction. The DC to remove a blight's cursed domain is equal to 10 + 1/2 the blight's Hit Dice + its Charisma modifier. If successful, the remove curse effect suppresses the domain of evil for 1 hour per caster level, during which time the associated blight becomes sickened. The cursed domains of multiple blights can overlap, but the effects do not stack-this simply makes it more difficult to remove the curse effect since there are multiple epicenters. Since all blights have at least 10 Hit Dice, these domains of evil always become strongly evil-aligned. A blight's cursed domain has open borders, and creatures can freely enter and leave. Unlike the typical domains of evil, animals are not particularly unsettled by a blight's domain of evil. While magic and time are not affected in this cursed domain, each blight infuses the domain with a specific hazard, as detailed in the blight's entry.",
			"- **Rejuvenation (Su):** If a blight is slain within its cursed terrain, a new blight of the same type spontaneously forms in 1d10 days at the epicenter of the blight's cursed domain unless the blight's corpse is targeted with a remove curse spell (DC = 10 + the blight's Hit Dice).",
			"- **Spell-Like Abilities (Sp):** Once a blight establishes a cursed domain, it gains the ability to use a small suite of spell-like abilities to issue commands to plants and animals within its domain. Once per day, a blight with a cursed domain can use the following spell-like abilities, once per day each, while within its domain: blight, command plants, dominate monster (animals and magical beasts only), greater curse terrain, and hallucinatory terrain. In addition, each type of blight gains an additional spell-like ability unique to its terrain, as indicated in the blight's stat block. A blight's caster level for these spell-like abilities always equals its CR.",
			"- **Telepathy (Su):** Blights can communicate telepathically with any intelligent creature within their domain.",
			"- **Vision (Ex):** Unlike most oozes, blights have eyes and can see normally. In addition, all blights have blindsight to a range of 120 feet."

A Huge or smaller creature can move through any square occupied by a kaiju, and vice versa. A kaiju can make attacks of opportunity only against foes that are Huge or larger and can be flanked only by Huge or larger foes. A kaiju gains a bonus for being on higher ground only if its entire space is on higher ground than that of its target.

Doing so does not requires an action. A kaiju can attempt a new save to end the effect as often as it wishes, but can attempt to remove only one such effect per round. Once per year, if a kaiju takes an amount of damage that would normally kill it by reducing its hit points to a negative amount equal to its Constitution score, the damage instead heals the kaiju of twice the amount of damage-but this healing leaves the kaiju disoriented and demoralized. At this point, the creature becomes nauseated and seeks only to return to its lair. Any amount of damage dealt to it by an external source before it reaches its lair, though, immediately negates the nauseated effect and allows the kaiju to end its retreat and attack.",

			"- Unless stated otherwise, a troop's attacks are nonmagical. Damage reduction sufficient to reduce a troop attack's damage to 0 or other special abilities can give a creature immunity (or at least resistance) to the troop's attacks. Some troops also have other special attacks in addition to normal damage or deal more damage than their Hit Dice would normally suggest. Troops threaten all creatures within their reach or within their area, and resolve attacks of opportunity by dealing automatic troop damage to any foe in reach who provokes such an attack of opportunity. Troops are still limited to making one such attack per round unless the text states otherwise.",
			"- Because of the chaos of combat, spellcasting or concentrating on spells within the area of a troop or within its reach requires a successful caster level check (DC = 20 + spell level). Using skills that involve patience and concentration requires a successful DC 20 Will save.",
			"- **Looting Troops:** Although troops are composed of a number of individual creatures, the chaos and destruction of battle means that not all of these creatures' equipment survives the rigors of combat. As a result, parties who wish to claim usable gear or treasure from slain foes treat a troop as a single creature for the purposes of looting, and should be able to recover gear worth a total value equal to the troop's expected treasure value (as determined by the troop's CR)."

These effects last for 1 round, and multiple failed saving throws against multiple members of the wild hunt in a single round do not cause this duration to stack.

Each wild hunt creature shares a different set of abilities with other creatures in the link.
