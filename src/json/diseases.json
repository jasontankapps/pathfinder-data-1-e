It slowly freezes creatures from the inside out without dealing cold damage, so sufferers simply feel the weariness and fatigue of exerting themselves in a cold environment. The affliction reduces an affected creature's range of movement and acts in many ways like very gradual petrification. A sufferer is unable to speak, is severely slowed, and takes Dexterity damage; if the victim's Dexterity score drops below 5, it is unable to move at all. Creatures suffering from this plague don't die from it, but it often strands them out in the cold where they die from exposure."

This vile sickness spreads through water, affecting plant and animal life alike. In higher creatures, the demonplague causes madness and then death, but in animals and other unintelligent beasts, it continues beyond death, animating them as undead horrors called plagued beasts. The plague also twists and corrupts plant life-most of the hazardous plants detailed below are the results of normal plants becoming corrupted by the demonplague."
