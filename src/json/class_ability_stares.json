		"At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, a mesmerist's hypnotic stare imposes a further effect upon its target. The mesmerist chooses one option each time he gains a new bold stare improvement, and the choice can't be changed later. The mesmerist can't choose the same bold stare improvement more than once unless otherwise noted. All of the mesmerist's bold stare improvements affect the target as long as it is affected by the mesmerist's hypnotic stare.",
		"",
		"Chelish mesmerists have refined their hypnotic stares to include a suite of gaze attacks useful for negotiating with or undermining outsiders. In the decades since, these secrets have begun to slip beyond the Hell-bound nation's borders, and now can be found throughout the Inner Sea region, especially in areas that interact frequently with outsiders.",
		"",
		"Devilbane gazes, which are marked with a dagger (&ast;) below, can be selected beginning at 3rd level as options for the mesmerist's bold stare improvements. They tend to be more limited in their scope than standard bold stare improvements, but cut to the core of an outsider's being. When a devilbane gaze is used against a creature with the outsider type, double the hypnotic stare penalty applied by the devilbane gaze improvement (but not the Will save penalty the original hypnotic stare imposes). Despite their moniker, devilbane gazes affect all outsiders equally well."
