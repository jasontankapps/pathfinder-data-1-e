These abilities are represented as feats. While some feats are more useful to certain types of characters than others, and many of them have special prerequisites that must be met before they are selected, as a general rule feats represent abilities outside of the normal scope of your character's race and class. Many of them alter or enhance class abilities or soften class restrictions, while others might apply bonuses to your statistics or grant you the ability to take actions otherwise prohibited to you. By selecting feats, you can customize and adapt your character to be uniquely yours.",

			"\"Teamwork\" is a relative term. Many villains don't concern themselves with collateral damage and make their plans with exceeding ruthlessness. Presented below are several teamwork feats with the common theme of reaping a benefit at your allies' expense. All of these feats refer to an initiator and an abettor. The initiator is the one activating the feat (also referred to as \"you\") and the abettor is an ally who also has the feat and whose presence and (perhaps unwilling) sacrifice allows the feat to take effect. Choosing one of these feats effectively grants consent for an ally with the same feat to harm you in combat, and vice versa, but evil characters are often willing to take big risks to get the upper hand. Some recruit devoted minions specifically to use in this way. Characters with class abilities granting allies access to teamwork feats (such as cavaliers or inquisitors) can select these teamwork feats normally, but allies who are granted these feats can use the feats only as initiators, not as abettors. An inquisitor could not grant an ally the Ally Shield feat and then use the ally as a shield, for example, but he could allow that ally to use him as a shield.",

		"description": [
			"**Description Source** [Ultimate Campaign pg. 66](source/ultimate_campaign)  ",
			"A story feat reflects a goal-often an all-consuming one-that shapes your life. Each story feat incorporates a trigger event (which comes from either a campaign occurrence or your background), an immediate benefit, a goal, and a further benefit for achieving that goal.",
			"",
			"Story feats are marked with the story keyword. Each feat has at least two possible prerequisites, representing conditions most likely met during play or a background that fits the feat (see [Backgrounds](rule/character_background)). You need to meet only one of these prerequisites. Anytime you gain a new feat, you may take a story feat, but you can have only one uncompleted story feat at a time. Story feats are designed for PCs, but can be taken by NPCs and monsters as well.",
			"",
			"Unlike typical feats, story feats have nebulous prerequisites, and you should chose one only after talking with the GM. The GM should weave a story feat into the greater story of the campaign and even adjust it as needed to fit the campaign's long-term goals and the specifics of your background. Story feats should work organically within the story of the campaign, rather than be chosen purely for their mechanical benefits.",
			"",
			"Like the prerequisites, the completion conditions for a story feat might require GM adjudication. If the events of the campaign are not likely to resolve the story implied by the story feat, the GM should consider shifting the goal to something you can achieve. Establishing a meaningful story arc is more important than adhering to the letter of the feat.",
			"",
			"Because a story feat represents both your motivation and character development, the GM should make an effort to incorporate elements related to the feat into the ongoing campaign. These can be direct elements, like the appearance of a villain or hated creature, or indirect elements, such as rumors of the fate of a lost relative or NPCs who are impressed by a PC's artistic endeavors. A good rule of thumb is to work in a reference to each PC's story feat once every three to five sessions.",
			"",
			"In most cases, allies can assist in completing a story feat. At the GM's discretion, if you do not take a leadership role in tasks or conflicts related to your own story feat, you might need to complete additional goals to resolve the story feat, or might even be denied completion altogether.",
			"",
			"### Common Rules",
			"",
			"Many story feats share similar terminology in their prerequisites and completion conditions. The following terms have special meanings when used in story feats.",
			"",
			"**Appropriate Number:** These are either creatures whose individual CRs add up to 20, or creatures whose individual CRs add up to 5 times your character level, whichever is greater. For example, if you're at 6th level, an appropriate number of creatures have CRs that add up to 30. This calculation is based on your current character level, not the level at which you selected the story feat. Overly easy challenges (encounters with CRs of 3 or more below your character level) don't count unless circumstances make them much more difficult to handle.",
			"",
			"**Challenging Foe:** This is a foe or group of foes with a total CR of 10 or a CR of 3 plus your character level, whichever is higher. If this refers to a distinct individual, the foe's CR is set when the feat is taken, but the foe advances in power as you do. Otherwise, it refers to your current level. A typical recurring foe advances in CR by 1 for every 1-2 levels you gain.",
			"",
			"**Character's Level:** Normally, this is your actual character level. If you're a creature best represented by CR rather than character level (such as most monsters with more than 1 HD), use your calculated CR instead of your character level.",
			"",
			"**Decisively Defeat:** You overcome a foe in some way, such as by killing the creature, knocking it unconscious, or causing it to be taken prisoner. You must be a significant participant in the conflict to defeat the opponent, even if another strikes the final blow. Whether or not merely causing the enemy to flee qualifies is up to the GM. Generally, driving off an enemy while causing little actual harm does not qualify as a decisive defeat.",
			"",
			"**Slay:** Slaying a foe includes killing it, destroying it, turning it to stone, banishing it to the Abyss, or otherwise eliminating it in a fashion reversible only by powerful magic. Unless otherwise noted, you must deal the final blow yourself to slay a creature.",
			"",
			"**Thwart:** Distinct from defeating a foe, thwarting a foe involves disrupting its plans in a substantial and essentially permanent fashion. Deposing a lord, bringing down a priest's temple, or banishing a sorcerer to the depths of Hell all qualify as thwarting. You keep any benefits gained by thwarting a foe even if it survives defeat and returns more powerful than before. You must be a significant participant in the events that lead to your foe being thwarted for your actions to count toward fulfilling a story requirement.",
			"",
			"### Story Feats and Stacking",
			"",
			"Most story feat bonuses are untyped, and stack with almost any other bonus. However, if you have multiple story feats, their untyped bonuses do not stack with each other. For example, if two story feats gave you a bonus on saving throws, you would add only the higher bonus.",
			"",

			"## Metamagic Feats",
			"",
			"**Description Source** [PRPG Core Rulebook pg. 112](source/prpg_core_rulebook)  ",
			"As a spellcaster's knowledge of magic grows, he can learn to cast spells in ways slightly different from the norm. Preparing and casting a spell in such a way is harder than normal but, thanks to metamagic feats, is at least possible. Spells modified by a metamagic feat use a spell slot higher than normal. This does not change the level of the spell, so the DC for saving throws against it does not go up. Metamagic feats do not affect spell-like abilities.",
			"",
			"**Wizards and Divine Spellcasters:** Wizards and divine spellcasters must prepare their spells in advance. During preparation, the character chooses which spells to prepare with metamagic feats (and thus which ones take up higher-level spell slots than normal).",
			"",
			"**Sorcerers and Bards:** Sorcerers and bards choose spells as they cast them. They can choose when they cast their spells whether to apply their metamagic feats to improve them. As with other spellcasters, the improved spell uses up a higher-level spell slot. Because the sorcerer or bard has not prepared the spell in a metamagic form in advance, he must apply the metamagic feat on the spot. Therefore, such a character must also take more time to cast a metamagic spell (one enhanced by a metamagic feat) than he does to cast a regular spell. If the spell's normal casting time is a standard action, casting a metamagic version is a full-round action for a sorcerer or bard. (This isn't the same as a 1-round casting time.) The only exception is for spells modified by the Quicken Spell metamagic feat, which can be cast as normal using the feat.",
			"",
			"For a spell with a longer casting time, it takes an extra full-round action to cast the spell.",
			"",
			"**Spontaneous Casting and Metamagic Feats:** A cleric spontaneously casting a cure or inflict spell, or a druid spontaneously casting a summon nature's ally spell, can cast a metamagic version of it instead. Extra time is also required in this case. Casting a standard action metamagic spell spontaneously is a full-round action, and a spell with a longer casting time takes an extra full-round action to cast. The only exception is for spells modified by the Quicken Spell feat, which can be cast as a swift action.",
			"",
			"**Effects of Metamagic Feats on a Spell:** In all ways, a metamagic spell operates at its original spell level, even though it is prepared and cast using a higher-level spell slot. Saving throw modifications are not changed unless stated otherwise in the feat description.",
			"",
			"The modifications made by these feats only apply to spells cast directly by the feat user. A spellcaster can't use a metamagic feat to alter a spell being cast from a wand, scroll, or other device.",
			"",
			"Metamagic feats that eliminate components of a spell don't eliminate the attack of opportunity provoked by casting a spell while threatened. Casting a spell modified by Quicken Spell does not provoke an attack of opportunity.",
			"",
			"Metamagic feats cannot be used with all spells. See the specific feat descriptions for the spells that a particular feat can't modify.",
			"",
			"**Multiple Metamagic Feats on a Spell:** A spellcaster can apply multiple metamagic feats to a single spell. Changes to its level are cumulative. You can't apply the same metamagic feat more than once to a single spell.",
			"",
			"**Magic Items and Metamagic Spells:** With the right item creation feat, you can store a metamagic version of a spell in a scroll, potion, or wand. Level limits for potions and wands apply to the spell's higher spell level (after the application of the metamagic feat). A character doesn't need the metamagic feat to activate an item storing a metamagic version of a spell.",
			"",
			"**Counterspelling Metamagic Spells:** Whether or not a spell has been enhanced by a metamagic feat does not affect its vulnerability to counterspelling or its ability to counterspell another spell (see Magic).",
			"",
			"`table0`",
			"",
			"## Item Creation Feats",
			"",
			"**Description Source** [PRPG Core Rulebook pg. 112](source/prpg_core_rulebook)  ",
			"An item creation feat lets a character create a magic item of a certain type. Regardless of the type of item each involves, the various item creation feats all have certain features in common.",
			"",
			"**Raw Materials Cost:** The cost of creating a magic item equals half the base price of the item.",
			"",
			"Using an item creation feat also requires access to a laboratory or magical workshop, special tools, and so on. A character generally has access to what he needs unless unusual circumstances apply.",
			"",
			"**Time:** The time to create a magic item depends on the feat and the cost of the item.",
			"",
			"**Item Cost:** Brew Potion, Craft Staff, Craft Wand, and Scribe Scroll create items that directly reproduce spell effects, and the power of these items depends on their caster level-that is, a spell from such an item has the power it would have if cast by a spellcaster of that level. The price of these items (and thus the cost of the raw materials) also depends on the caster level. The caster level must be low enough that the spellcaster creating the item can cast the spell at that level. To find the final price in each case, multiply the caster level by the spell level, then multiply the result by a constant, as shown below:",
			"",
			"Scrolls: Base price = spell level &times; caster level &times; 25 gp.  ",
			"Potions: Base price = spell level &times; caster level &times; 50 gp.  ",
			"Wands: Base price = spell level &times; caster level &times; 750 gp.  ",
			"Staves: The price for staves is calculated using more complex formulas (see Magic Items).",
			"",
			"A 0-level spell is considered to have a spell level of 1/2 for the purpose of this calculation.",
			"",
			"**Extra Costs:** Any potion, scroll, or wand that stores a spell with a costly material component also carries a commensurate cost. For potions and scrolls, the creator must expend the material component cost when creating the item. For a wand, the creator must expend 50 units of the material component. Some magic items similarly incur extra costs in material components, as noted in their descriptions.",
			"",
			"**Skill Check:** Successfully creating a magic item requires a Spellcraft check with a DC equal to 5 + the item's caster level. Alternatively, you can use an associated Craft or Profession skill to attempt this check instead, depending upon the item being crafted. See Magic Item Creation for more details on which Craft and Profession checks may be substituted in this manner. The DC of this check can increase if the crafter is rushed or does not meet all of the prerequisites. A failed check ruins the materials used, while a check that fails by 5 or more results in a cursed item. See Magic Items for more details.",

			"",
			"**Patronage:** All damnation feats require the patronage of an evil outsider-typically a daemon, devil, demon, or kyton. This evil outsider patron must be favorably disposed toward the character and must have a number of Hit Dice equal to or greater than her character level. An evil outsider summoned via a spell like planar binding might be coerced to serve as a character's patron (whether that character is the spell's caster or another seeking patronage). The caster of a planar binding spell must still attempt Charisma checks to coerce the outsider into service, but she gains a +4 bonus on her Charisma checks if that service is to act as a damnation feat's patron. Other outsiders might more willingly serve as patrons at the GM's discretion.",
			"",
			"#### Damnation",
			"",
			"When a character takes a damnation feat, his soul is damned. The character's spirit is promised to a dark power, whether an evil deity or a foul planar race, and his soul will ultimately be consigned to some grim fate after his death. The method by which one becomes damned typically determines the specifics of this eternal doom, but the in-game effects are the same regardless.",
			"",
			"Upon taking a damnation feat, the character's soul becomes ensnared by dark, otherworldly forces. From that point on, if the character dies, returning him to life proves to be more difficult. Any nonevil spellcaster who attempts to bring the character back from the dead must attempt a caster level check (DC = 10 + the slain character's Hit Dice). Success means the spell functions as normal, while failure means the spell fails and cannot be attempted again for 24 hours. Evil spellcasters, however, can raise the slain character normally, without a check.",
			"",
			"Upon taking a second damnation feat, the character becomes even more ensnared by his doom. He remains difficult to return from the dead (as noted above), and he can't be affected by breath of life or raise dead, even when these spells are cast by an evil spellcaster. Also, the character's alignment shifts one step toward evil (typically toward the alignment of whatever creature serves as his patron).",
			"",
			"This corruption continues if the character takes a third damnation feat. He is affected as previously noted, and in addition, the spell resurrection no longer affects him. The character's alignment again shifts one step toward evil (typically toward the alignment of whatever creature serves as his patron).",
			"",
			"Finally, upon taking a fourth damnation feat, the character can no longer be returned from the dead by any method short of a wish or miracle. The character's alignment shifts one more step toward the alignment of whatever creature serves as his patron.",

			"Character traits are abilities that are not tied to your character's race or class. They can enhance your character's skills, racial abilities, class abilities, or other statistics, enabling you to further customize him. At its core, a character trait is approximately equal in power to half a feat, so two character traits are roughly equivalent to a bonus feat. Yet a character trait isn't just another kind of power you can add on to your character-it's a way to quantify (and encourage) building a character background that fits into your campaign world. Think of character traits as \"story seeds\" for your background; after you pick your two traits, you'll have a point of inspiration from which to build your character's personality and history. Alternatively, if you've already got a background in your head or written down for your character, you can view picking his traits as a way to quantify that background, just as picking race and class and ability scores quantifies his other strengths and weaknesses.",
			"",
			"**Many traits grant a new type of bonus:** a \"trait\" bonus. Trait bonuses do not stack-they're intended to give player characters a slight edge, not a secret backdoor way to focus all of a character's traits on one type of bonus and thus gain an unseemly advantage. It's certainly possible, for example, that somewhere down the line, a \"Courageous\" trait might be on the list of dwarf race traits, but just because this trait is on both the dwarf race traits list and the basic combat traits list doesn't mean you're any more brave if you choose both versions than if you choose only one.",
			"",
			"Character traits are only for player characters. If you want an NPC to have traits, that NPC must \"buy\" them with the [Additional Traits](feat/additional_traits) feat. Player characters are special; they're the stars of the game, after all, and it makes sense that they have an advantage over the NPCs of the world in this way.",

					[ "[Chance Encounter](trait/chance_encounter)", "Campaign", "Wrath of the Righteous", "You always tended to get in over your head as a child, but your biggest youthful misadventure was the time you \"accidentally\" found yourself behind enemy lines in the Worldwound. You probably never would have made it back home to Kenabres if not for the help of a mysterious woman who helped you trick your way through a group of cultists. The woman never told you her name, but you remember her beauty and a deep sense of sadness she seemed to carry with her. Her skill with the bow was impressive as well, but the thing you remember most about her was the symbol of Desna she wore-she often held onto it without seeming to realize it, as if the connection to the goddess was something she clung to in a sense of need, as someone might clutch at a rope while dangling over a vast pit. She left your side a few moments before you were picked up by a patrol of crusaders, who finished the job of escorting you back to safety, and you've never seen her again. Ever since, you've just been lucky when it comes to trickery. Once per day, if you fail an Acrobatics, Bluff, Disguise, Sleight of Hand, or Stealth check, you may immediately reroll that check as a free action. You must take the second result, even if it is worse." ],

					[ "[Cheat Death](trait/cheat_death)", "Religion", "Besmara", "Even Besmara's most faithful worshipers usually call upon her only in times of greatest need.

					[ "[Chelish Noble](trait/chelish_noble)", "Campaign", "Hell's Vengeance", "You had the fortune to be born into one of Cheliax's noble families, and even more importantly, your family is one of those loyal to House Thrune. Perhaps your family has been allied with Thrune since the Chelish Civil War, or maybe Thrune granted your family its title in exchange for its support during that conflict. In any case, your experience growing up among the nation's well-to-do has given you an upper hand when it comes to knowledge of high society, and you start the game with a modest inheritance. With the nascent uprising of the Glorious Reclamation in Cheliax, there is much concern among the aristocracy, and House Thrune needs the support of loyal nobles now more then ever." ],
					[ "[Chelish Sympathizer](trait/chelish_sympathizer)", "Social", "", "You feed intelligence to the Thrice-Damned House of Thrune for your own gain or ideological reasons and are given valuable clues gathered by other Chelish spies in exchange.

					[ "[Chernasardo Hopeful](trait/chernasardo_hopeful)", "Campaign", "Ironfang Invasion", "You've pledged your skills and your life to the Chernasardo rangers, studying to protect your homeland from foreign invaders. You currently remain a neophyte in this secretive guerrilla army. You have yet to be entrusted with many of their secrets, and spend a great deal of time training with the old ranger Aubrin in Phaendar to hone your skills of hunting and tracking. In forest or plains terrain, you may reduce a single target's effective level of concealment against you (from total concealment to concealment to not concealed) by studying your natural surroundings as a move action. This reduced concealment ends immediately once the target moves from its current location. At 10th level, you may study your terrain as a swift action instead." ],

Perhaps it was your parents, or an older sibling, or an uncle or aunt-whatever the case, one of your close relatives is, or was, a well-known and well-loved actor or actress. That this relation died in some compromising and embarrassing way has done little to alter your family's name and fame-if anything, the unfortunate death has increased it. When folk learn your last name, they are quick to assume you live a wild life like your ill-fated relative, and whether you bask in this notoriety or do your best to hide your heritage, the years of association with the acting scene have had their effect. You've certainly inherited your relative's talents, and are a larger-than-life figure, a melodramatic attention-hound, or a sly manipulator of emotions. You gain a +1 trait bonus on Perform (act) skill checks, and the skill is always considered a class skill for you. Furthermore, You've inherited some of your relative's funds, and begin play with a nest egg of 300 gp that you can spend however you wish." ],
					[ "[Child of Kintargo](trait/child_of_kintargo)", "Campaign", "Hell's Rebels", "You had the fortune (or perhaps the misfortune, depending on your viewpoint) to be born into one of Kintargo's noble families. Your experience growing up among the city's well-to-do has given you an upper hand when it comes to knowledge of high society, and you start the game with a modest inheritance. With the new situation in Kintargo brewing, there is much concern about an eventual restructuring of the city's nobility. Already, one noble estate has burned to the ground under what can best be described as suspicious circumstances, but whether the government or rebels were responsible depends on whom you ask. With this trait, the assumption is that you belong to a minor noble family (and can make up your family name). In this case, your family keeps a small manor in the Greens. If you want to be a member of one of Kintargo's major noble families, you must take the Noble Scion feat at 1st level." ],
					[ "[Child of Mumia](trait/child_of_mumia)", "Regional", "Osirion", "During your childhood, you knew someone who was addicted to mumia, a drug made from the flesh of the dead, whether that was a drug-addled parent, an unsavory employer, or a libertine childhood friend.

					[ "[Child of Oppara](trait/child_of_oppara)", "Campaign", "War for the Crown", "You belong to a noble family that matters in Taldor, though as the story begins you may or may not be on good terms with your relatives. Your upbringing among the city's well-to-do gives you an upper hand when it comes to knowledge of high society, and you start the game with a modest inheritance. With Princess Eutropia's efforts to provide for Taldor's common citizens and overturn years of tradition, new lines are being quietly drawn in the sand, and you have found yourself embroiled in these intrigues whether you intended to be or not." ],
					[ "[Child of Two Peoples](trait/child_of_two_peoples)", "Race", "half-elf, half-orc, or human", "Your parents come from two visibly different cultures that maintain distinct identities regardless of their physical proximity (such as Tians and Ulfen).

					[ "[Child of Wati](trait/child_of_wati)", "Regional", "Osirion", "You were raised near the infamous necropolis of Wati, and even managed to sneak into these hallowed grounds on occasion. Entering the clergy of the Voices of the Spire in Wati was a natural choice as you grew older, and your past experiences made you a particularly well-informed disciple of the church. Your effective cleric level is 1 higher for the purposes of channeling positive energy to damage undead. Your effective cleric level cannot exceed your character level." ],

					[ "[Child of the Crusades (WotR)](trait/child_of_the_crusades_wotr)", "Campaign", "Wrath of the Righteous", "Your parents were members of the crusade, as were their parents before them.

They've told you of other family members who have also been involved in the crusade, and it's not uncommon for you to meet a distant cousin or long-lost aunt, uncle, or other family member while traveling among the border towns of Mendev. This strong family tie bolsters your mind and sense of belonging to the crusade. Once per day when you fail a saving throw against an effect created by a demon that would possess or incapacitate you mentally, you may immediately reroll that saving throw as a free action.

As a result, you try to manage the chaos that rages within your soul, but you're always on the lookout for the opportunity to truly unleash destruction. These days, there's plenty of work for someone who will do what needs to be done, no questions asked, and the rewards from House Thrune for those who work with it are a strong incentive as well.

Perhaps your family was asked to give up something dear as a sacrifice, such as the life of a newly born brother or sister. Maybe the church used your family as a scapegoat to cover up a crime someone higher in the church committed. Or perhaps you simply met someone who opened your eyes and showed you the truth-that Asmodeus does not care for his followers, and that the deity of your new religion does.

Over the years, you fell out of favor with the Sczarni, and eventually left to pursue interests outside of simple banditry, though you still remember the lessons your criminal relations taught you.

You finish people's sentences, blurt out the punch lines to slowly-told jokes, rarely make plans, and leap headlong into anything that looks like it might get interesting. While this has sometimes gotten you in trouble, it's also trained you to start moving a split second before everyone else, and that's saved your hide a few times as well. You gain a +2 trait bonus on all Initiative checks." ],

Something, be it your own personal force of will, some strange \"infection\" from the assault, or perhaps a combination of both, has made you stronger than before. You're not sure what to make of the theories that you survived this exposure to awfulness because you yourself have some trace of demonic heritage that helped give you the advantage you needed to survive- but whatever it was, you're glad for it! Your strange resistance to demonic attacks persists to this day.

You owe your sanity and your life to a woman named Haleen. She could be your sister or merely a childhood companion, but whatever your relationship to her, she took care of you and protected you. She's always been a part of your life, and although her temper often kept her from making friends or keeping a job, she's always been kind to you. Haleen was instrumental in securing your freedom from slavery or making sure you got a good apprenticeship or job in society-but recently, she'd been growing strangely morose and depressed. You and Haleen normally kept no secrets, but whatever was bothering her wasn't something she shared with you. One night, she vanished, leaving you a brief note, begging you to forget her and to get on with your life, but something about the note bothered you-something in the way she phrased her words struck you as forced. You may be convinced she'd been kidnapped, forced to leave against her will, or even magically controlled, but you also suspect that she left you to protect you from something-that was ever her way. You're now convinced that it's time for you to step in and protect her, but you had no idea where she may have gone until recently. Several months have passed since she disappeared, and you've spent those months searching for clues to her location, and you've finally found a lead-a mysterious note, a strange dream, the result of a back-alley divination, or a report of a sighting of a woman matching Haleen's description has come to you, placing Haleen in the vicinity of an old ghost town named Kelmarane. What she's doing there and how she came to be there makes no sense to you yet, but the lead is the strongest one you've had. This and Garavel's advertisement for mercenaries to accompany him to the region is all the omen you need. You joined Garavel's group and eagerly await the day you'll be leaving for Kelmarane. Although Haleen chose to become a swashbuckling adventurer, she always encouraged you to seek your own path, and her support is the primary reason you chose the class you did at 1st level. This class is always a favored class to you, and your dedication to it is such that every time you take a level in the class, you gain +1 hit point and 1 additional skill point over and above what you would normally gain.

Although this removed the key witness and resulted in the accused being set free, the stigma was enough to badly damage the accused's reputation.

Whatever the peril was, you would have certainly died if not for the swift actions of Koya or Shalelu, who intervened just in time to save your life. You've never forgotten this, and remain fiercely loyal to the NPC who saved you. Perhaps even more importantly, the method in which she saved you seems to have had an impact on your own skills. If Koya saved you, she did so by casting a healing spell on you just before you died, and as a result you gain a +2 trait bonus whenever you use cure spells to heal damage. If it was Shalelu who saved you, she did so by pulling you to safety while simultaneously defeating the peril that almost did you in, and as a result, you gain a +1 trait bonus on Acrobatics checks and Acrobatics is a class skill for you.

He's even given you a pass to attend the gambling tournament he's about to throw-you're not sure how into gambling you'll be, but perhaps there'll be some visitors from out of town you can talk to about the strange shadow in the sky. At the very least, you're hoping someone at the tourney will be into magic-there's not really enough folk in this town who seem all that interested in magic, you've found. Your interest in magic dates back quite far, and as a result, you've developed a knack for identifying common magical items at a glance.

Either way, you know the system is broken, and you've dedicated your life to fixing it. But tradition rules Taldor as much as any Grand Prince, and change requires more influence than you have- so far. you've got a few friends and allies, and plenty of determination, but while you work toward the power you need to change the nation, you'll have to resort to more discrete ways of righting wrongs and curbing the abuses of the upper class. You gain a +1 trait bonus on Disable Device and Knowledge (local) checks, and one of these skills is always a class skill for you. Once per day, you can call upon your coconspirators to have \"made arrangements\" on your behalf, allowing you to attempt a Knowledge (local) check in place of a single Bluff, Disable Device, Intimidate, or Sleight of Hand check. The DC of this Knowledge (local) check is equal to the DC of the skill check it replaces. Whatever arrangements you make-for doors left unlocked, guards strong-armed out of your way, stolen keys left for you to find-must be reasonable to have anticipated and achieved beforehand; you could arrange to have a noble convinced you're a very important diplomat traveling in disguise, for example, but if a fight breaks out you could not rely on your network of contacts to feint for you in combat.

If you're Ameiko's younger sibling, your ferocious independence and self-confidence give you a +1 trait bonus on Will saving throws. If you're Sandru's younger sibling, your hearty constitution gives you a +1 trait bonus on all Fortitude saving throws. If you're Shalelu's younger sibling, your quick reflexes give you a +1 trait bonus on all Reflex saving throws. Note: Although you're a younger sibling of an established NPC, this doesn't necessarily lock you in to being the same race as that NPC-if you're a different race or ethnicity than the NPC you choose as your older sister or brother, you were adopted into the family by your parents. In addition, you gain a +1 trait bonus on all attack rolls against foes that threaten your older sibling. NPC Choices: Ameiko, Sandru, Shalelu." ],

You gain a +1 trait bonus on Knowledge (religion) checks, and that skill is a class skill for you. As long as you remain completely faithful to the tenets of your faith (as determined by the GM), you never suffer from the Bleaching." ],
					[ "[Zealot's Bearing](trait/zealot's_bearing)", "Faith", "", "Your fiery passion for your faith or philosophy is obvious to everyone around you. Those who share your convictions automatically find themselves wanting to defer to your zealous authority, making you a natural leader of your faith.

Whenever you have a morale bonus to weapon attack rolls, you also receive a +1 trait bonus on weapon damage rolls." ]

You gain a +2 trait bonus on Fortitude saving throws against poison, and once per day when attempting a saving throw to resist girtablilu poison, you can roll twice and take the higher result. |",
			"| [Vigilant Battler](trait/vigilant_battler) |  | You are hard to fool and harder to trick with a feint. You gain a +1 trait bonus on all Sense Motive checks. This trait bonus increases to +2 when used to counter a feint in combat. |",
			"| [Volatile Fuse](trait/volatile_fuse) |  | Firearms you wield are especially dangerous to you and everyone nearby. Whenever a firearm you wield misfires or explodes, roll a d%. On a result of 1-25, the misfire or explosion is delayed; reroll the attack with a -5 penalty (penalties from the broken condition are not applied to this reroll, and a firearm that was already broken does not explode). After the reroll is resolved, apply the effects of the misfire or explosion as normal. (If the d% roll result is 26 or higher, the misfire or explosion happens as normal.) Whenever a firearm you wield explodes due to a misfire, increase the explosion's damage by 1d6 plus 1d6 for every 4 character levels you have. |",
			"| [Wary Eye](trait/wary_eye) |  | You know that you could be exposed at any time. Even your closest friends could someday become enemies, and so you have trained yourself to never be surprised by a betrayal. At the beginning of combat, before initiative checks are revealed, you can select one opponent you are aware of to be the subject of this trait. If you succeed at a Wisdom check opposed by the subject's initiative check, you are not considered flat-footed against this subject for this combat, even if you normally would be. You can use this trait in a surprise round, even if you cannot otherwise act that round. |",
			"| [Weapon of Peace](trait/weapon_of_peace) |  | Even though you are a trained combatant, proficient with any number of weapons, you don't relish killing your enemies. It's not that you're afraid of seeing blood, but rather that disabling a foe is superior to killing someone capable of admitting defeat. When using a melee weapon that deals lethal damage to instead deal nonlethal damage, you take only a -2 penalty instead of -4. |",
			"| [Witty Repartee](trait/witty_repartee) | Kitharodian Academy | You are quick with your tongue and have always possessed the talent to quickly admonish your enemies. You gain a +1 trait bonus on Bluff checks and Bluff is a class skill for you. |",
			"| [Youthful Infiltrator](trait/youthful_infiltrator) |  | You were trained from a young age to ambush the enemies of your order or organization, which makes you hard to trust for most outside your organization if they learn your affiliation. You gain a +1 trait bonus on attack rolls against flat-footed foes, as long as they have not seen you make an attack with this bonus before. |"

			"| --- | --- | --- |",
			"| [Accidental Clone](trait/accidental_clone) | Return of the Runelords; human | Adventuring has been in your blood for as long as you can remember, and this urge to go out and explore the world left you recently in over your head when you (foolishly or bravely, depending on how you look at it) decided to explore an old Thassilonian ruin near your home town. |",
			"| [Adaptive Magic](trait/adaptive_magic) | Reign of Winter | The wonders of magic have always fascinated you, and you find the urge to tinker and experiment with magic almost irresistible. |",

			"| [Alabaster Outcast](trait/alabaster_outcast) | Shattered Star | You are a member of one of Magnimar's wealthiest families' or rather, you used to be. A falling-out left you disowned and disinherited. |",
			"| [Amoral Mercenary](trait/amoral_mercenary) | Hell's Vengeance; NE | You have always looked after yourself first, and done whatever you need to do to survive. |",
			"| [Ancient Explorer](trait/ancient_explorer) | Skull and Shackles | You are a student of the ancient history of Golarion, and you've come to the Shackles to explore the crumbling and vine-choked ruins of the cyclops empire of Ghol-Gan, which have lain abandoned among the isles of the Shackles for thousands of years. |",
			"| [Animal Whisperer](trait/animal_whisperer) | Ironfang Invasion | You've spent more of your life around animals than people, and find them easier to understand. |",
			"| [Apothecary](trait/apothecary) |  | Everyone suspects the sweaty, shifty-eyed apothecary sells poisons from his cluttered, acrid smelling wreck of a shop. You're one of the few in town who know this for a fact. |",
			"| [Apprentice Devilbinder](trait/apprentice_devilbinder) | Hell's Vengeance | It's no secret that conjuring and binding devils is a popular pursuit in Cheliax, and you have served as an apprentice to a diabolist since a young age. |",
			"| [Artifact Hunter (GS)](trait/artifact_hunter_gs) | Giantslayer | You've always had an interest in magic, but you're fascinated with those legendary magic items known as artifacts. You've spent years researching these mythical relics and committed the stories and legends about them to memory, making you something of an expert on the subject. |",
			"| [Asmodean Acolyte](trait/asmodean_acolyte) | Hell's Vengeance | You grew up in the church of [Asmodeus](faith/asmodeus), and have served as a faithful follower your entire life. |",
			"| [Athletic](trait/athletic) | Ruins of Azlant | You have always had a knack for physical activity. |",
			"| [Athletic Champion](trait/athletic_champion) | War for the Crown | Your physique and skill brought you into the public eye, and a winning smile helps you stay there. |",
			"| [Audrahni's Ally](trait/audrahni's_ally) | Return of the Runelords | While every PC should be at least passingly familiar with the elven gravedigger Audrahni, you are one of the few in town she counts as a true friend. |",
			"| [Azlanti Scholar (RoAPG)](trait/azlanti_scholar_roapg) | Ruins of Azlant | You are familiar with an aspect of Azlanti lore. |",
			"| [Barroom Talespinner](trait/barroom_talespinner) | Skull and Shackles | You grew up listening to tales of adventure and piracy on the high seas and the sea chanteys of old salts in dockside dives. |",
			"| [Bastard (KM)](trait/bastard_km) | human; Kingmaker | One of your parents was a member of one of the great families of Brevoy, perhaps even of the line of Rogarvia itself. Yet you have no substantive proof of your nobility, and you've learned that claiming nobility without evidence makes you as good as a liar. |",
			"| [Besmara's Blessing](trait/besmara's_blessing) | Skull and Shackles | You were born aboard a ship at sea or down by the docks in a port city on an auspicious day. Old salts and sea dogs nod knowingly and say that Besmara the Pirate Queen, goddess of piracy, sea monsters, and strife, has marked you for a greater destiny. |",
			"| [Best Customer](trait/best_customer) | Jade Regent | You've sat on your favorite barstool at the Rusty Dragon every night for as long as you can remember- and some nights you can't remember thanks to a few too many drinks. |",
			"| [Best Friend](trait/best_friend) | Jade Regent | You are best friends with one of the NPCs; you've grown up together, and while your friend has had a much more exciting life than you so far, you hope one day to follow in your friend's footsteps and see the world. |",
			"| [Betrayed (CotCT)](trait/betrayed_cotct) | Curse of the Crimson Throne | You were hardly a model citizen as a child or young adult. Your reasons for turning to a life of crime may be varied, but what matters is that you eventually fell in with a certain well-connected and notorious crime lord named Gaedren Lamm. |",
			"| [Bitter Nobleman](trait/bitter_nobleman) |  | A local unscrupulous family was hit hard recently, revealing criminal ties that damaged its reputation as well. One noble is eager to rebuild his presence in town, and you're one of the ones he's selected as an agent. |",
			"| [Black Sheep](trait/black_sheep) |  | You were born and raised in town. You know many of the region's secrets and the locals already know who you are. You aren't quite hated in town, but folk seem to think you're a troublemaker and a bastard and not to be trusted. |",
			"| [Blight-Burned](trait/blight-burned) | Ironfang Invasion | You were raised deep in the Fangwood Forest, but in your childhood the Darkblight overtook your community, and blighted fey attacked your friends and family. |",
			"| [Blood of Giants](trait/blood_of_giants) | Reign of Winter | You're a big person, and people have always said you've got some giant blood in you. |",
			"| [Blood of Pharaohs](trait/blood_of_pharaohs) | Mummy's Mask | Long ago, one of your ancestors ruled over the lands of Osirion. Although you are many generations removed and the line of descent is hard to prove, his or her blood still runs in your veins. |",
			"| [Boarded in Cheliax](trait/boarded_in_cheliax) | Serpent's Skull | While you aren't necessarily a native of Cheliax, you boarded the Jenivere at one of that country's port cities. |",
			"| [Boarded in Mediogalti](trait/boarded_in_mediogalti) | Serpent's Skull | Your travels have brought you to the Jenivere through the dangerous port of Ilizmagorti, home to both pirates and assassins. |",
			"| [Boarded in Mwangi Expanse](trait/boarded_in_mwangi_expanse) | Serpent's Skull | You boarded the Jenivere in the Mwangi Expanse, where you've lived or recently traveled through. You harbor no illusions regarding the deadliness of the jungles, the creatures that inhabit it, or the peoples that make their home therein. |",
			"| [Boarded in Varisia](trait/boarded_in_varisia) | Serpent's Skull | Traveling from lands far to the north, you likely have little experience with the jungle, its denizens, or its strange forces. Just as the lands of Garund are wild and exotic to you, so are you to them. |",
			"| [Boarded in the Shackles](trait/boarded_in_the_shackles) | Serpent's Skull | Your last home was in the Shackles, a dangerous land of pirates and treachery, but also of fantastic opportunity. |",
			"| [Brigand](trait/brigand) | Kingmaker | You hail from the River Kingdoms or the more lawless reaches of Brevoy. Life has been hard for you. |",
			"| [Buccaneer's Blood](trait/buccaneer's_blood) | Skull and Shackles | One of your ancestors was an infamous Free Captain of the Shackles, whose very name struck fear in the hearts of those who sailed the seas in search of an honest living. |",
			"| [Caravan Guard](trait/caravan_guard) | Jade Regent | You recently hired on to Sandru's caravan to serve as a guard, but the job, while it paid well, gave you little chance to scratch the adventuring itch, since the caravan never really ventured into dangerous territory. You understand why Sandru avoided the more dangerous routes, of course, but that didn't help assuage your urge to seek adventure. You've just told Sandru that you're quitting the job in order to try your hand at adventuring- he seemed to understand, and even gave you some good tips on how best to survive potential challenges. You gain a +1 trait bonus on Survival checks, and Survival becomes a class skill for you. NPC Choices: Sandru. |",
			"| [Chance Encounter](trait/chance_encounter) | Wrath of the Righteous | You always tended to get in over your head as a child, but your biggest youthful misadventure was the time you \"accidentally\" found yourself behind enemy lines in the Worldwound. You probably never would have made it back home to Kenabres if not for the help of a mysterious woman who helped you trick your way through a group of cultists. The woman never told you her name, but you remember her beauty and a deep sense of sadness she seemed to carry with her. Her skill with the bow was impressive as well, but the thing you remember most about her was the symbol of Desna she wore-she often held onto it without seeming to realize it, as if the connection to the goddess was something she clung to in a sense of need, as someone might clutch at a rope while dangling over a vast pit. She left your side a few moments before you were picked up by a patrol of crusaders, who finished the job of escorting you back to safety, and you've never seen her again. Ever since, you've just been lucky when it comes to trickery. Once per day, if you fail an Acrobatics, Bluff, Disguise, Sleight of Hand, or Stealth check, you may immediately reroll that check as a free action. You must take the second result, even if it is worse. |",
			"| [Chance Savior](trait/chance_savior) | Carrion Crown | Fate smiled on you and Professor Lorrimor one day in the not so distant past. Through a matter of pure chance, you were in a position to save the late scholar's life and did so. His gratitude was effusive, and he promised that he would never forget you. You are unsure of the nature of the summons in his will, but believe he may have listed you as a possible heir in thanks for saving him from an untimely demise. |",
			"| [Chelish Noble](trait/chelish_noble) | Hell's Vengeance | You had the fortune to be born into one of Cheliax's noble families, and even more importantly, your family is one of those loyal to House Thrune. Perhaps your family has been allied with Thrune since the Chelish Civil War, or maybe Thrune granted your family its title in exchange for its support during that conflict. In any case, your experience growing up among the nation's well-to-do has given you an upper hand when it comes to knowledge of high society, and you start the game with a modest inheritance. With the nascent uprising of the Glorious Reclamation in Cheliax, there is much concern among the aristocracy, and House Thrune needs the support of loyal nobles now more then ever. |",
			"| [Chernasardo Hopeful](trait/chernasardo_hopeful) | Ironfang Invasion | You've pledged your skills and your life to the Chernasardo rangers, studying to protect your homeland from foreign invaders. You currently remain a neophyte in this secretive guerrilla army. You have yet to be entrusted with many of their secrets, and spend a great deal of time training with the old ranger Aubrin in Phaendar to hone your skills of hunting and tracking. In forest or plains terrain, you may reduce a single target's effective level of concealment against you (from total concealment to concealment to not concealed) by studying your natural surroundings as a move action. This reduced concealment ends immediately once the target moves from its current location. At 10th level, you may study your terrain as a swift action instead. |",
			"| [Child of Infamy](trait/child_of_infamy) | Council of Thieves | Your family has long been in show business. Perhaps it was your parents, or an older sibling, or an uncle or aunt-whatever the case, one of your close relatives is, or was, a well-known and well-loved actor or actress. That this relation died in some compromising and embarrassing way has done little to alter your family's name and fame-if anything, the unfortunate death has increased it. When folk learn your last name, they are quick to assume you live a wild life like your ill-fated relative, and whether you bask in this notoriety or do your best to hide your heritage, the years of association with the acting scene have had their effect. You've certainly inherited your relative's talents, and are a larger-than-life figure, a melodramatic attention-hound, or a sly manipulator of emotions. You gain a +1 trait bonus on Perform (act) skill checks, and the skill is always considered a class skill for you. Furthermore, You've inherited some of your relative's funds, and begin play with a nest egg of 300 gp that you can spend however you wish. |",
			"| [Child of Kintargo](trait/child_of_kintargo) | Hell's Rebels | You had the fortune (or perhaps the misfortune, depending on your viewpoint) to be born into one of Kintargo's noble families. Your experience growing up among the city's well-to-do has given you an upper hand when it comes to knowledge of high society, and you start the game with a modest inheritance. With the new situation in Kintargo brewing, there is much concern about an eventual restructuring of the city's nobility. Already, one noble estate has burned to the ground under what can best be described as suspicious circumstances, but whether the government or rebels were responsible depends on whom you ask. With this trait, the assumption is that you belong to a minor noble family (and can make up your family name). In this case, your family keeps a small manor in the Greens. If you want to be a member of one of Kintargo's major noble families, you must take the Noble Scion feat at 1st level. |",
			"| [Child of Oppara](trait/child_of_oppara) | War for the Crown | You belong to a noble family that matters in Taldor, though as the story begins you may or may not be on good terms with your relatives. Your upbringing among the city's well-to-do gives you an upper hand when it comes to knowledge of high society, and you start the game with a modest inheritance. With Princess Eutropia's efforts to provide for Taldor's common citizens and overturn years of tradition, new lines are being quietly drawn in the sand, and you have found yourself embroiled in these intrigues whether you intended to be or not. |",
			"| [Child of the Crusades (WotR)](trait/child_of_the_crusades_wotr) | Wrath of the Righteous | Your parents were members of the crusade, as were their parents before them. (If you are an elf, gnome, or other long-lived race, these could be brothers or cousins instead, since it's possible that the Worldwound simply didn't exist at a time before you were born.) The righteousness of the crusades sometimes feels as if it runs in your very blood, and it bolsters you against demonic influence. Your parents may be alive still, or they may have perished on a mission-that choice is up to you. You grew up knowing them, though, and their zeal and devotion to the crusade is the primary reason you feel the same way. They've told you of other family members who have also been involved in the crusade, and it's not uncommon for you to meet a distant cousin or long-lost aunt, uncle, or other family member while traveling among the border towns of Mendev. This strong family tie bolsters your mind and sense of belonging to the crusade. Once per day when you fail a saving throw against an effect created by a demon that would possess or incapacitate you mentally, you may immediately reroll that saving throw as a free action. You must take the second result, even if it is worse. |",
			"| [Childhood Crush](trait/childhood_crush) | Jade Regent | You've never had the guts to act on it, but for as long as you can remember, You've had a crush on one of the NPCs. Someday, maybe you'll be able to earn the NPC's love, but for now, you're content to spend time in the NPC's proximity, or even to do things for the NPC that might earn you a word of thanks or a smile. Once per day, you may attempt to earn a kind word or a smile from the NPC whom you have a crush on by making a DC 15 Charisma check. If you're successful, the elation and joy at the attention gives you a +1 trait bonus on all saving throws for the remainder of the day. If you're ever lucky enough to win the NPC's love, this +1 trait bonus on saving throws applies at all times, as long as your relationship remains active. Note that gender isn't an issue in the case of these three NPCs. Unless your GM says otherwise, all three of these NPCs are considered to be bisexual as far as this trait's implications are concerned. Note that if you take this trait, you'll likely want to coordinate NPC choices with any other player who chooses this trait as well, since choosing the same NPC could cause unwanted party strife. Of course- if that's what you and the other player are looking for, go for it! In addition, you gain a +1 trait bonus on all attack rolls against foes that threaten your crush. NPC Choices: Ameiko, Sandru, Shalelu. |",
			"| [Close Allies](trait/close_allies) | Return of the Runelords | You and another PC are close allies-friends, lovers, siblings, or even twins. Work with the other player to build a shared history-both you and the other player must choose Close Allies as a campaign trait, and both must agree to the nature of the relationship between the two characters. (At the GM's option, more than two PCs can be linked by this trait.) You and your close ally have always supported each other. You might have the tendency to complete each other's sentences, dress similarly, share the same religion or faith, or have endured a dangerous event together in the past. If you and the other player agree (and have chosen either the siblings or twins option below), you might not even particularly like your close \"ally,\" yet you still respect them and can utilize this trait's benefits all the same. |",
			"| [Colonial](trait/colonial) | Serpent's Skull | You come from a long line of Sargavan colonists, stretching back to Cheliax's original expansion into the land during the Everwar. While your people's control of Sargava wanes every day, and Eleder has functioned independently from Cheliax since House Thrune brought diabolism to the political forefront, you nevertheless maintain a hardy Chelish constitution and natural sense of survival. What took you away from home is up to you, but you return to the land of your birth on the Jenivere in the hope of putting Sargava back on the map. You gain a +1 trait bonus on Knowledge (local) checks relating to Sargavan settlements and politics and a +1 trait bonus on saving throws against disease. |",
			"| [Conspiracy Hunter](trait/conspiracy_hunter) | Council of Thieves | You've long heard rumors of dark deeds afoot in Westcrown. Shipments of valuable cargo that go missing with nary a trace or question asked. People who disappear as though they never existed. Lords of business and nobles who speak in veiled references and accidental slips of masters even they must obey. What lords rule the Westcrown underworld? Do the tales of far-reaching criminal organizations hold a hint of truth? Could the fabled Council of Thieves, said to have been purged from the city ages ago, have somehow survived or reformed? And what hold do they hold over the city today? You don't know, but you're determined to find out! Choose one of the following skills: Bluff, Diplomacy, Knowledge (local), Perception, Sense Motive, or Stealth. You gain a +1 trait bonus on this skill and it is always considered a class skill for you. |",
			"| [Daring Doomsayer](trait/daring_doomsayer) | Second Darkness | The end times are coming, and the shadow in the sky over Riddleport is just the first piece of proof. Convinced that the end of the world is nigh, you've decided to take part in the Golden Goblin's gambling tournament-after all, what do you have to lose? Whenever you roll a -1- on an attack roll, you gain a +1 trait bonus on your next attack roll so long as it is made within 1 minute. You also begin play with a placard bearing an apocalyptic slogan of your choice-this wooden sign can be used as a club. |",
			"| [Devotee of the Old Gods](trait/devotee_of_the_old_gods) | Mummy's Mask | Osirion has a history stretching back over 8,000 years, and the deities worshiped today in modern Osirion are not the same ones revered in Ancient Osirion's heyday-deities with names like Anubis, Osiris, Ra, and Set, among others. Your family never lost the faith of your ancestors, however, and your devotion to one of the deities of Ancient Osirion has helped keep the memory of Osirion's past alive-a past that still lingers on in the untouched necropolis of Wati. You gain a +1 trait bonus on Knowledge (history) and Knowledge (religion) checks, and one of those skills is always a class skill for you. In addition, your faith in the old gods of Osirion grants you a +1 trait bonus on saving throws against divine magic. For more information on the deities of Ancient Osirion, see *Pathfinder Adventure Path #80: Empty Graves.* |",
			"| [Diabolist Raised](trait/diabolist_raised) | Council of Thieves | All your life you've lived within the grip of devil-possessed Cheliax. You care little for the religion of your country, but that is the way of life in the most magnificent empire in the world, and who are you to question the faith of the empire's rulers? Certainly not a fool like some of your more idealistic acquaintances, possessed of bizarre ideals about personal freedoms and egalitarian rulership-who can say whatever happened to them? You know of Hell and the rigidity of its grim rulers, you've seen devils and how they might be employed to the betterment of those with the might to control them, and you know of the dark faith of your country. You might not be a devil worshiper yourself, but there are realities to living in Cheliax, and it's always good to know what's really going on behind the scenes. Your knowledge of diabolism grants you a +1 bonus on Bluff, Diplomacy, Intimidate, and Sense Motive checks made against Westcrown's nobility, and a +1 bonus on all saving throws made against mind-affecting attacks from devils. |",
			"| [Disgraced Noble](trait/disgraced_noble) | War for the Crown | Your noble family used to matter, until your father took a stand against Maxillar Pythareus, the commander of Taldor's military. True or not, the accusations Pythareus leveled against your family in return destroyed your reputation and isolated you from the society you grew up in. Now the only thing that matters to you is clawing your way back up the social ladder, either for your own quality of life or to clear your family's name. You've had to practice deception as you began working your way back into Taldan social circles; you gain a +2 trait bonus on Bluff checks to conceal your identity and a +2 bonus on Linguistics checks to spot or produce forgeries, and one of these skills is always a class skill for you. Once each day, you can choose a single humanoid you believe to have been involved in the conspiracy to destroy your family; you gain a +1 morale bonus on attack and damage rolls against that NPC for a number of rounds equal to your character level. At 10th level, this bonus increases to +2. |",
			"| [Diva in Training](trait/diva_in_training) | Hell's Rebels | The opera is perhaps the most important and prestigious form of entertainment offered in Kintargo, and the Kintargo Opera House is among the most famous of its kind. You're hardly a superstar among the performers who've graced the stage there, but you have performed several times before in small parts. Just recently, you got your big break-you'd won a role in the infamous opera Huntress of Heroes, and had been studying for the role furiously before the onset of martial law dashed your plans to the dirt. Now that the Kintargo Opera House has been claimed by Barzillai Thrune, all shows have been canceled and your chance at success seems to have been lost. Yet you can't lose hope. You still practice your skills, and some day, perhaps the Kintargo Opera House will open its doors again, at which point you intend to be center stage! |",
			"| [Dockside Avenger](trait/dockside_avenger) | Curse of the Crimson Throne | No crime is too despicable for Gaedren Lamm and his thugs-a gang of lowlife murderers, kidnappers, and drug dealers that operate in Korvosa's Midland district. You've lost someone to Lamm and now you're out for revenge. While Lamm remains alive and free, you are not slain until your hit point total reaches a negative number equal to your Constitution score + 3. Once Lamm is imprisoned or killed, you lose the former benefit but gain 3 permanent hit points. |",
			"| [Dockside Brawler](trait/dockside_brawler) | Skull and Shackles | You grew up on the dangerous docks of one of the Shackles' numerous ports or anchorages, and quickly learned that fists often make a better point than fancy words, especially when used the right way. You've always preferred action to talk, anyway. You gain a +1 trait bonus on damage rolls with brass knuckles and improvised weapons. |",
			"| [Dragonfoe](trait/dragonfoe) | Giantslayer | You've always hated dragons. Perhaps one of your ancestors was a well-known dragonslayer, or a rampaging dragon killed your family or friends. Maybe the stories you grew up hearing about knights rescuing captive princes and princesses from the clutches of evil dragons inspired you to slay dragons. Whatever the reason for your obsession, it has driven you to study how to fight dragons and defend yourself against their fearsome attacks. You gain a +1 dodge bonus to AC against creatures with the dragon type and a +2 trait bonus on Reflex saves against breath weapon attacks. |",
			"| [Driven By Guilt](trait/driven_by_guilt) | Strange Aeons; Good-aligned | You awake after your ordeal with a lingering feeling that you have taken part in something outside the normal bounds of your morals. Whether you were corrupted at one point or compelled to perform some forgotten actions, this guilt drives you to fight against those forces in the world that prey upon the good. You see your present condition as a chance to redeem yourself and banish this unsettling emotion. |",
			"| [Drug Addict](trait/drug_addict) | Curse of the Crimson Throne | Someone you know has become addicted to shiver, a drug distilled from the venom of tropical arachnids known as dream spiders. The drug induces sleep filled with vivid dreams, during which the user's body shakes and shivers, giving the substance its street name. You've always thought of shiver as a problem of the lower class, but then someone you know overdosed on the stuff. You've done a bit of investigating and have learned that the villain who got your friend addicted in the first place was a crime lord named Gaedren Lamm. Unfortunately, the guards seem to be focused on the bigger dealers. They don't have time to devote many resources to what You've called \"a bit player in a beggar's problem.\" It would seem that if Gaedren's operation is to be stopped, it falls to you. |",
			"| [Dwarf-Trained](trait/dwarf-trained) | Giantslayer | Dwarves are well acquainted with the threats posed by giants and orcs, and they have spent centuries honing their techniques for fighting these foes. You have trained with the dwarves and have learned some of the tactics they use against their hated enemies. You gain a +2 dodge bonus to AC against creatures with the giant subtype (this does not stack with the bonus granted by the defensive training racial trait of dwarves and gnomes) and a +1 trait bonus on attack rolls against creatures with the orc subtype (this does not stack with the bonus granted by the dwarf hatred racial trait). Dwarves and gnomes can't choose this trait. |",
			"| [Eager Performer](trait/eager_performer) | Rise of the Runelords | Hearing that Sandpoint had a theater rivaling those found in large cities like Magnimar and Korvosa, you decided to try your luck getting stage time there. After sending a letter to Cyrdak Drokkus requesting an audition and not hearing back, you've taken it upon yourself to travel to Sandpoint and meet him in person, trusting your force of will and charming influence will get you what you want. You gain a +1 trait bonus on checks for any one Perform skill. Additionally, choose any one spell of the enchantment school; its save DC increases by +1. |",
			"| [Eagle Knight Recruit](trait/eagle_knight_recruit) | Ruins of Azlant | Since Talmandor's Bounty is an Andoren colony and is unlikely to see the threat of slavery, the presence of the Eagle Knights isn't strongly needed, and the Bountiful Venture Company would prefer to not have that organization immediately associated with the colony (despite the colony's name having been derived from the Eagle Knights' patron, Talmandor). However, the need for safety can't be overlooked. You were a soldier in the Andoren army or you were a civilian who showed great promise in military matters. The Eagle Knights recruited you and offered unofficial Eagle Knight status if you managed to make it into the ranks of the colonists. There, you would see to the safety of the colony and send back reports with each supply ship regarding the general state of the colony and any threats you notice. The Bountiful Venture Company admired your military prowess and selected you for the second wave of colonists to arrive at Talmandor's Bounty. |",
			"| [Earning your Freedom](trait/earning_your_freedom) | Legacy of Fire | You've been a slave your whole life, and have passed from master to master more times than you can count. Some of those masters were cruel, others kindly. In all cases, You've yearned to be free. When your most recent master fell on hard times, he sold many of his slaves to the city government, and as luck would have it, a recent opportunity to earn your freedom has manifested. The Pactmasters of Katapesh are looking to revitalize an old trade route to Osirion, and a band of mercenaries and guards is gathering to go out and supplement forces already in place near the ruined village of Kelmarane, now said to be infested by gnolls. You've secured a place among those mercenaries, under the watchful eye of Garavel. If you help in retaking Kelmarane, You've been promised your freedom. In any event, your life as a slave has toughened you and made you more resistant to hardship. Choose one of the three categories of saving throw; you gain a +1 trait bonus on all saving throws of that type. |",
			"| [Employee](trait/employee) | Ruins of Azlant | You have worked for the Bountiful Venture Company or you are the child of one of its current employees. This connection helped you get a leg up on the competition to get involved in the establishment of Talmandor's Bounty. The company didn't want nepotism to show through too strongly, so you weren't included in the first wave of colonists and instead have been selected to accompany the second wave of colonists to the island. You don't want people to know that you're part of the company, but your contacts in the Bountiful Venture Company didn't necessarily tell you that you needed to keep it a secret. |",
			"| [Enduring Stoicism](trait/enduring_stoicism) | Strange Aeons | Even though your pulse is pounding in your ears when you awake in the asylum, you feel strangely nonplussed. You can recognize that the situation you find yourself in is horrific, but you refuse to let that fear control you. It doesn't feel like it's worth worrying over too much. You know that when you face unspeakable forces, keeping your cool will keep you alive. |",
			"| [Erratic Malefactor](trait/erratic_malefactor) | Hell's Vengeance; CE | Some people follow codes and traditions; others look out for only themselves. You don't care-you do what you want, when you want, sometimes for a good reason, and sometimes for no reason at all. You revel in your status as an outlier, and take pride in the fact that you follow no one else's orders-at least most of the time. In a lawful land like Cheliax, one has to be more careful and at least pay lip service to the rules and restrictions of society. As a result, you try to manage the chaos that rages within your soul, but you're always on the lookout for the opportunity to truly unleash destruction. These days, there's plenty of work for someone who will do what needs to be done, no questions asked, and the rewards from House Thrune for those who work with it are a strong incentive as well. If working with others gives you the freedom to carry out some of your darkest instincts without fear of repercussion, then why not-at least for now. You can worry about the future when it comes. |",
			"| [Ex-Asmodean](trait/ex-asmodean) | Hell's Rebels | You, or perhaps your family, were once worshipers of Asmodeus, but something happened that made you lose your faith. Perhaps your family was asked to give up something dear as a sacrifice, such as the life of a newly born brother or sister. Maybe the church used your family as a scapegoat to cover up a crime someone higher in the church committed. Or perhaps you simply met someone who opened your eyes and showed you the truth-that Asmodeus does not care for his followers, and that the deity of your new religion does. In any event, you left the church, and as a result, your family was punished; they were either put in prison, exiled from Kintargo, or perhaps even executed. Ever since, you've vowed to some day get revenge against the church. |",
			"| [Ex-Iomedaean](trait/ex-iomedaean) | Hell's Vengeance | You, or perhaps your family, were once worshipers of [Iomedae](faith/iomedae), but something happened that made you lose your faith. Perhaps your family was accused of being dishonorable or cowardly, or maybe one of your family members was the victim of church \"justice.\" Or perhaps you simply met someone who opened your eyes and showed you the truth-that the Inheritor's so-called honor, valor, and justice are just tin plating on a strict dogma that seeks to control people by restricting their free will. In any event, you left the church, and as a result, your family was subjected to scorn and holier-than-thou disapproval. Ever since, you've vowed to some day get revenge against the church of Iomedae-and with the current situation brewing in Cheliax, you might finally have the opportunity. |",
			"| [Ex-Sczarni](trait/ex-sczarni) | Shattered Star | Though you were raised as a member of one of Magnimar's various Sczarni gangs, you never fit in with the rest of your settled, metropolitan brethren. The Pathfinder Society in particular recognized your wanderlust and potential as an agent, and on more than one occasion you impressed or bamboozled their agents with your street smarts and finesse. Over the years, you fell out of favor with the Sczarni, and eventually left to pursue interests outside of simple banditry, though you still remember the lessons your criminal relations taught you. You gain a +2 trait bonus on Bluff checks to pass hidden messages. Also, anytime you deliver a coup de grace, you deal an additional 1d6 points of damage. |",
			"| [Exchange Agent](trait/exchange_agent) | Shattered Star | Although you're a relative newcomer to Magnimar, you're not some naive stranger. You've been sent by the Pathfinder Society lodge in your home country to learn more about Varisia by experiencing the frontier firsthand. After arriving, you reported to the Magnimar lodge and placed your expertise at the venture-captain's disposal. To represent your experience in distant lands, choose a country other than Varisia as your homeland and gain one of the languages spoken in that country as a bonus language (see The Inner Sea World Guide). Additionally, choose one of the following skills: Handle Animal, Knowledge (geography), Linguistics, or Survival. You gain a +1 trait bonus on checks made with this skill and it is always a class skill for you. |",
			"| [Expert Explorer](trait/expert_explorer) | Ruins of Azlant | Adventurous scholars raised you, or perhaps you were born during an expedition and haven't known any other life. You get fidgety and impatient when you become too familiar with a certain place. You are used to having excitement and the quest for knowledge guides your path in life, and you picked up a number of skills along the way that relate to this lifestyle. During your interview with the Bountiful Venture Company, they were impressed with the diverse locations you've visited in your life and selected you because of your skills in maneuvering uncharted territory. |",
			"| [Exposed to Awfulness](trait/exposed_to_awfulness) | Wrath of the Righteous | When you were a child, you were nearly slain by a demon that managed to make its way through the wardstones into the lands beyond. The demon was slain before it could kill you, but you lingered at death's door in a coma for weeks before waking. Ever since then, you've been unusually hale and hearty, as if your body had endured its brush with awfulness by becoming supernaturally fit. But still, the scars (whether physical or purely mental) of your brush with death remain, and nightmares of what could have happened often plague your sleep. Something, be it your own personal force of will, some strange \"infection\" from the assault, or perhaps a combination of both, has made you stronger than before. You're not sure what to make of the theories that you survived this exposure to awfulness because you yourself have some trace of demonic heritage that helped give you the advantage you needed to survive- but whatever it was, you're glad for it! Your strange resistance to demonic attacks persists to this day. Once per day when you fail a saving throw against an effect created by a demon that would kill or physically incapacitate you, you can immediately reroll that saving throw as a free action. You must take the second result, even if it is worse. |",
			"| [Eye for Plunder](trait/eye_for_plunder) | Skull and Shackles | You've always had a keen eye for the glitter of gold or silver, and You've robbed enough rich merchants and raided enough ships to have a feel for where the most valuable plunder is hidden. You gain a +1 trait bonus on Appraise and Perception checks to find concealed or secret objects (including doors and traps). In addition, you begin the campaign with a selection mundane trade goods worth 50 gp that you were able to scrounge together during your first day on the Wormwood. |",
			"| [Failed Winter Witch Apprentice](trait/failed_winter_witch_apprentice) | Reign of Winter | As a child, you were apprenticed as a winter witch in the frozen land of Irrisen, but you did not complete your training. Perhaps you disagreed with the politics of Irrisen's White Witches, or you had an altercation with one of your teachers, or maybe you were just ill-suited to the practice of witchcraft. Whatever the reason, you left the ranks of the winter witches and left Irrisen. Whether or not you have continued your training on your own, you still retain some small knowledge of witchery and the magic of the icy north. You gain a +1 trait bonus on Knowledge (arcana) and Spellcraft checks to identify spells or magical effects with the cold descriptor, and one of these skills (your choice) is a class skill for you. In addition, you gain Hallit or Skald (this does not count toward your number of languages). |",
			"| [Family Ties (RotRL)](trait/family_ties_rotrl) | Rise of the Runelords | While not ethnically a Varisian, you have been raised among Varisians and they consider you one of their own. Furthermore, you managed to get in good with a group of Sczarni and consider them your new family. After being run out of the last place your Sczarni family camped, you tracked down a friend of the family in Sandpoint-a ruthless thug named Jubrayl Vhiski at the Fatman's Feedbag. During your time with the Sczarni, you learned a few tricks of the trade. You gain a +1 trait bonus on Knowledge (local) checks and Knowledge (local) is always a class skill for you. In addition, you begin play able to speak and read Varisian. |",
			"| [Favored Son or Daughter](trait/favored_son_or_daughter) |  | You were born and raised in the town of Sandpoint or its surrounding farms. You know many of the region's secrets, and the locals already know who you are. You are well liked in town, and you'll have lots of friends in the region, but the town's tougher side sees you as a snitch or a pansy. You gain a +1 trait bonus on Knowledge (local) checks, and Knowledge (local) is always a class skill for you. In addition, you can choose any one law-abiding citizen of Sandpoint from below as an ally; depending on the person you pick, you'll get different benefits. |",
			"| [Fed-Up Citizen](trait/fed-up_citizen) | Hell's Rebels | Kintargo is a tough place to live if you count yourself as a law-abiding citizen. While you likely agree with most others of Kintargo that many of the laws put in place by House Thrune seem excessive, you always respected the law and honored it as best you could. You likely worship a deity such as Abadar or Iomedae -a lawful neutral or perhaps lawful good power allowed to practice within Cheliax, but only under restrictions. Yet despite this, Thrune has always made Cheliax a safer place to live. But with recent events, enough is enough. As much as it pains you to admit, the law of the land is now manifestly and obviously not correct, and something must be done to oppose this misuse of power. If that means aligning yourself to a rebel faction such as the Silver Ravens, so be it. |",
			"| [Finding Haleen](trait/finding_haleen) | Legacy of Fire | You never knew your parents-perhaps they died when you were a child, or maybe you were taken from them and raised elsewhere as a slave. You owe your sanity and your life to a woman named Haleen. She could be your sister or merely a childhood companion, but whatever your relationship to her, she took care of you and protected you. She's always been a part of your life, and although her temper often kept her from making friends or keeping a job, she's always been kind to you. Haleen was instrumental in securing your freedom from slavery or making sure you got a good apprenticeship or job in society-but recently, she'd been growing strangely morose and depressed. You and Haleen normally kept no secrets, but whatever was bothering her wasn't something she shared with you. One night, she vanished, leaving you a brief note, begging you to forget her and to get on with your life, but something about the note bothered you-something in the way she phrased her words struck you as forced. You may be convinced she'd been kidnapped, forced to leave against her will, or even magically controlled, but you also suspect that she left you to protect you from something-that was ever her way. You're now convinced that it's time for you to step in and protect her, but you had no idea where she may have gone until recently. Several months have passed since she disappeared, and you've spent those months searching for clues to her location, and you've finally found a lead-a mysterious note, a strange dream, the result of a back-alley divination, or a report of a sighting of a woman matching Haleen's description has come to you, placing Haleen in the vicinity of an old ghost town named Kelmarane. What she's doing there and how she came to be there makes no sense to you yet, but the lead is the strongest one you've had. This and Garavel's advertisement for mercenaries to accompany him to the region is all the omen you need. You joined Garavel's group and eagerly await the day you'll be leaving for Kelmarane. Although Haleen chose to become a swashbuckling adventurer, she always encouraged you to seek your own path, and her support is the primary reason you chose the class you did at 1st level. This class is always a favored class to you, and your dedication to it is such that every time you take a level in the class, you gain +1 hit point and 1 additional skill point over and above what you would normally gain. If multiple PCs take this trait, they should be siblings who were both protected and raised by Haleen. |",
			"| [Fixer of Odds](trait/fixer_of_odds) | Second Darkness | You're going to win the Golden Goblin's upcoming \"Cheat the Devil and Take His Gold\" tournament one way or the other. You gain a +1 trait bonus on Profession (gambling) checks, and creatures searching you for objects hidden on your body don't gain the usual +4 bonus on their Perception checks. Additionally, you begin play with a \"fixed\" six-sided die (it has two -6s' and no -1-) and a dagger. |",
			"| [Foe of the Strange](trait/foe_of_the_strange) | Strange Aeons | You awake feeling emboldened after a terrifying nightmare. Instead of being frightened by the bizarre creatures from your nightmares, these experiences have steeled you against these startling alien beings. You know that you fell victim to strange circumstances and loathsome forces, but you refuse to give in to a creeping sense of helplessness. Instead, you vow to fight back against whoever or whatever is responsible for your current situation. The creatures of your nightmares won't hold fear over your head. You'll take the fight to them. |",
			"| [Following in the Footsteps](trait/following_in_the_footsteps) | Ruins of Azlant | One of your dear friends or family members was part of the first wave of colonists to be selected by the Bountiful Venture Company to establish Talmandor's Bounty. You applied for the first wave as well, but weren't selected. Now that you've made your way into the second wave, you can't wait to be reunited with your family member. Your devotion to your family or friends is important to you, and it shows not only in how you feel about that friend or family member you are soon to reunite with, but also in how you treat other people with respect. |",
			"| [Fools for Friends](trait/fools_for_friends) | Second Darkness | You don't think of yourself as a gambler. In fact, you rather detest the whole thing. Unfortunately, one or more of your friends (pick one or more of the other players' characters) doesn't think so, and you've recently learned that friend-or friends-have decided to go to the Gold Goblin's \"Cheat the Devil and Take his Gold\" tournament. Which pretty much means you have to go as well, since if no one's there to watch out for them, they'll lose all their money and respect. Again. Sometimes it's hard being the responsible one. Your devotion to your friendships (even when said friends seem, at times, to be trying to test that devotion) is a point of pride to you. Whenever you take the [Aid Another](rule/aid_another) action to help an ally, or whenever an ally [aids you](rule/aid_another_2) in this manner, a successful check grants an additional +1 trait bonus to the check for which aid was being rendered. Additionally, as long as one of your friends is within 30 feet, you gain a +1 trait bonus on all saving throws against charm and compulsion effects. |",
			"| [Foreign Opportunist](trait/foreign_opportunist) | Mummy's Mask | You're not a native Osirian, but the opportunity to explore the tombs of Ancient Osirion-and \"liberate\" the treasures they hold-is too good to pass up. Whether or not you're interested in the history of this land, you're definitely interested in the wealth that's lain hidden in dusty crypts for millennia- such as the tombs in the newly opened necropolis of Wati. You gain a +2 trait bonus on Appraise checks, and that skill is always a class skill for you. In addition, your contacts in the antiquities markets allow you to sell relics of Ancient Osirion for 60% of their listed price, rather than the normal 50% value. What is considered a relic of Ancient Osirion is left to the GM's discretion. |",
			"| [Foreign-Tongued](trait/foreign-tongued) | Jade Regent | Intrigued by the travels of one of your long-time acquaintances, you've convinced her to teach you one of the exotic languages she picked up in her journeys. Choose one of the following characters. You may select one of that character's languages as a bonus language. Additionally, you gain a +2 trait bonus on Bluff checks made to pass secret messages to the chosen character (see the description of the Bluff skill). NPC Choices: Ameiko, Koya, Sandru, Shalelu. |",
			"| [Formerly Mind-Swapped](trait/formerly_mind-swapped) | Strange Aeons | You awake with a strange sensation beyond the frightening experience of extensive memory loss. Full recollections of the experience-like so many others-have been wiped from your mind, but at some point in your past your mind was swapped with that of a yithian, an alien being from beyond time and space. You don't remember details of your experiences wandering the yithians' peculiar city in a foreign body- and even worry whether this might be some strange hallucination- but every so often, a flash of insight strikes you as a result of this experience. You know that you can rely on these alien flashbacks during your investigation into your current situation, as it gives you greater perspective into an otherwise confusing world. |",
			"| [Foster Child](trait/foster_child) | Jade Regent | Koya Mvashti might be old enough to be your grandmother, but to you, she's always been your mom. Ever since your parents passed away, Koya's been taking care of you as if she were your mother. You never really figured out why Koya took you into her care, but you do know she's done this before-most recently with Sandru Vhiski, whom you think of as your brother. Growing up, Koya made sure that you had the best education possible, particularly in one particular topic. Choose any Knowledge skill-you gain a +2 bonus on skill checks with that Knowledge skill, and it becomes a class skill for you. In addition, you gain a +1 trait bonus on all attack rolls against foes that threaten your adoptive mother. NPC Choices: Koya. |",
			"| [Foxclaw Scout](trait/foxclaw_scout) | Ironfang Invasion | You are part of Nirmathas's informal network of hunters and scouts known as the Foxclaws, and study the secret vulnerabilities of those dangerous beasts that prey upon your fellow settlers. You gain a +2 trait bonus to confirm critical hits against creatures of the animal, magical beast, and vermin types, and while wearing a trophy from an animal, magical beast, or vermin whose CR was higher than your current class level, you gain a +1 morale bonus on Will saves. |",
			"| [Framed](trait/framed) | Curse of the Crimson Throne | Someone you know and love was accused of murder. A supposed eyewitness account from a local fisherman seemed to be enough to seal the case, but the accused had enough alibis that sentencing wasn't immediate. Someone confronted the fisherman and discovered he was intimidated into providing false witness and forced into planting the murder weapon by the actual murderer-a local crime lord named Gaedren Lamm, whose thugs killed the fisherman before he could recant his testimony. Although this removed the key witness and resulted in the accused being set free, the stigma was enough to badly damage the accused's reputation. If you can find Gaedren, you're sure you can find evidence that ties him to the murder and can clear the accused's name. |",
			"| [Friend of the Family](trait/friend_of_the_family) | Jade Regent | Your family has been close friends with the Mvashtis for as long as you've been alive. Old Niska Mvashti's recent death wasn't all that unexpected- she must have been over a hundred years old, as far as you know-but it was a sobering moment nonetheless. What no one else in your family knows, though, is that in the weeks before her death, Niska must have known that her days were numbered, because she called you to her house one day and made you make a promise: If her daughter Koya ever went on a long trip, you would go with her to ensure her safety. Although the chances of Koya going on a long trip seem remote (she must be at least 60 years old, after all), you've made a promise to Niska to accompany her daughter if such an event comes to pass. Ever since you made this promise, you've felt a strange sense of destiny looming in your future-you might even think that Niska is now watching over your shoulder, just as she asked you to watch over her daughter. As a result of this eerie sense of being watched over, you've been able to react to dangerous situations more quickly than ever. As long as Koya remains alive, you gain a +1 trait bonus on Perception checks, and Perception becomes a class skill for you. In addition, you gain a +1 trait bonus on all attack rolls against foes that threaten Koya. NPC Choices: Koya. |",
			"| [Friends and Enemies](trait/friends_and_enemies) | Rise of the Runelords | One of your family members, perhaps a parent, cousin, aunt, or uncle, helped Daviren Hosk put down a group of goblins near Sandpoint. Since then, your family member passed away, but not before telling you about that day and the offer Daviren made her should she ever be in need. Once you make it to Sandpoint and meet up with Daviren Hosk at the Goblin Squash Stables, he gives you one of his best steeds and all the necessary accoutrements as gratitude for your family member's help: a heavy combat trained horse, a military saddle, saddlebags, bit and bridle, a month's worth of feed, and lifetime stabling at the Goblin Squash Stables. |",
			"| [Frontier Healer](trait/frontier_healer) | Ironfang Invasion | You make your way in life by putting people back together after the rigors of the world take their toll-brewing herbal remedies, setting broken bones, and treating diseases. You gain a +1 trait bonus on all Heal and Knowledge (nature) checks, and one of these skills is always a class skill for you. Any time you restore hit points using the Heal skill or a cure spell (but not with channeled energy, lay on hands, or a magic device such as a potion or wand), you restore 1 additional hit point, plus 1 for every 2 class levels you have beyond 1st. |",
			"| [Get the Cargo Through](trait/get_the_cargo_through) | Serpent's Skull | Sea trade is never safe, even on the highly trafficked waters of the Inner Sea, but the way to Eleder is more perilous still. The ever-present hurricane known as the Eye of Abendego blows hundreds of ships each year off course, into jagged rocks, or directly to the sea floor. Pirates operating out of the Shackles Isles wait on the other side to take cargo from ships lucky enough to traverse or bypass the storm. Your job is to ensure a precious cargo aboard the Jenivere arrives safely in Eleder-what form this cargo takes and the nature of your relationship to it are up to you and your GM. Your character's history as a merchant or mercenary has earned her a respectable living, and you begin the campaign with an additional 300 gp in starting wealth. |",
			"| [Giant Slayer](trait/giant_slayer) | Rise of the Runelords | Your family's village was plundered by giants in the wilds of Varisia, leaving nothing but a smoldering ruin. After the destruction of your village, your family trained for combat against giants to prevent such a tragedy from ever happening again. Since hearing of giants mobilizing throughout the countryside, you ventured to Sandpoint to help the town prepare for a possible incursion. You gain a +1 trait bonus on Bluff, Perception, and Sense Motive checks and +1 trait bonus on attack rolls and damage rolls against creatures of the giant subtype. |",
			"| [Giant-Blooded](trait/giant-blooded) | Giantslayer | Your family has always been dogged by rumors that a bit of giant blood got into the family's veins at some point. Whether this was through alchemical or magical experimentation, or because your great-great-grandfather married a giant, it has made you big for your race, and may have given you other minor cosmetic features of giants, such as flaming red hair, a bluish tinge to your skin, or oversized hands. When you wield a weapon that is larger than your size, the penalty on attack rolls for using inappropriately sized weapons is reduced by half. In addition, you gain a +2 trait bonus to your CMD against awesome blow combat maneuvers. If you're a dwarf, your stability racial trait applies to awesome blow combat maneuvers as well. |",
			"| [Giantslayer Scion](trait/giantslayer_scion) | Giantslayer | You grew up listening to tales of a famed ancestor's mighty battles against giant foes. Just the mention of your ancestor's name is enough to strike fear into the heart of the most stalwart giant warrior, and you've resolved to follow in your forebear's footsteps. You take no penalty on Intimidate checks against creatures with the giant subtype that are larger than you, and you gain a +1 trait bonus to the DC of any fear-based effect you use against a creature with the giant subtype. |",
			"| [Gifted Satirist](trait/gifted_satirist) | Hell's Rebels | You grew up among Kintargo's performers and entertainers. Perhaps your parents or older siblings were singers at the Kintargo Opera House, or maybe you simply had to make ends meet as an orphan of the streets by busking. Whatever the case, you've long been exposed to the practice of cloaking scathing political commentaries in the form of harmless entertainment. Whether you conceal your satire in the form of novels, plays, screeds, or public letters, you've yet to make a name for yourself as a political presence in Kintargo-but in time, you hope to change that! |",
			"| [Gnoll Killer](trait/gnoll_killer) | Legacy of Fire | You grew up in rural Katapesh, in a region where gnoll activity was a fact of life. You killed your first gnoll at a young age when a group of gnoll slavers attacked your village, home, or caravan, and your hatred of gnolls has only grown since then. Something in your past fueled your hatred of gnolls even further- perhaps your family was slaughtered by gnolls, or maybe you even served a few harrowing weeks as a prisoner of a gnoll tribe before a miraculous escape. When you heard that Garavel was looking for brave men and women to aid in retaking the village of Kelmarane from a tribe of gnolls in the service of the notorious Carrion King, you knew you had to be part of the group, and signed up immediately. You gain a +1 trait bonus on attack rolls and weapon damage rolls made against gnolls. If you are a barbarian and you're fighting gnolls, your rage lasts 1 round longer than normal. If you're a ranger and you select humanoid (gnoll) as a favored enemy, your trait bonus on attack rolls and weapon damage rolls against gnolls increases to +2. If you're a spellcaster, you gain a +1 trait bonus to spell save DCs for damaging spells against gnolls. |",
			"| [Goblin Watcher](trait/goblin_watcher) | Rise of the Runelords | You grew up in Sandpoint staring off the cliff across the Varisian Gulf. Spending so much time there at Junker's Edge watching the goblins below as they scrounged through the discarded junk and seeing what they made out of the garbage, you developed an eye for spotting the most useful and valuable discarded items. You gain a +1 trait bonus on Perception and Appraise checks, and a +5 trait bonus on Appraise checks to determine the most valuable item visible in a treasure hoard. |",
			"| [Good Slip](trait/good_slip) | halfling; Hell's Vengeance | Halflings are a common sight in Cheliax and make up the majority of that nation's slave population. Known derisively as \"slips,\" halflings are almost universally treated with scorn and contempt, while paradoxically valued as the most precious slaves. You are a Chelish halfling, but unlike most of your race, you have embraced your role in Chelish society, and used it to your own advantage. People constantly overlook you or discount you as an inconsequential slip, but you know the truth-halflings are just as vital to the empire's health as its nobles, priests, and warriors. You may have been born a free halfling who has never known the chains of slavery, or a slave who was later freed after a period of loyal servitude. Or perhaps you are still a slave, happy (or at least content) in your enslavement, and hoping for some eventual recognition of your contribution, however small, to Cheliax's great and orderly society. |",
			"| [Hagfish Hopeful](trait/hagfish_hopeful) | Rise of the Runelords | Ever since passing through Sandpoint when you were a child and hearing about the contest at the popular tavern known as the Hagfish, you wanted to take that coin purse as your own and carve your name on the ceiling beam above the bar. Training yourself to choke down indigestible food and drink water a pig would refuse, you've built up quite a strong resistance to all things putrid and gross. You gain a +2 trait bonus on Fortitude saves against disease and poison. |",
			"| [Healthy](trait/healthy) | Ruins of Azlant | You come from a long line of hale and long-lived people. Growing up, you rarely got sick and had enough energy to run all day if it suited you. You don't get as tired as other people and repeated physical activities don't seem to bother you much. You were selected as part of the expedition because the Bountiful Venture Company saw great importance and promise in your robust health. |",
			"| [Hellknight Aspirant](trait/hellknight_aspirant) | Hell's Vengeance | You have always admired the authority, discipline, and righteousness of the ebon-armored [Hellknights](unknown/hellknights). Whether it's their unwavering self-control, uncompromising dedication to law and order, relentless pursuit of justice, or merciless administration of punishment, you have tried to model your own actions on the Hellknight philosophy called the Measure and the Chain. Your most fervent wish is to eventually join one of the Hellknight orders and take your place among the grim ranks dedicated to upholding and enforcing the laws of Hell and of Cheliax. |",
			"| [Hero Worship](trait/hero_worship) | Jade Regent | Everyone in town seems to admire Ameiko and Shalelu-they're heroes, after all, and played key roles in the recent troubles that plagued Sandpoint. You, though, take this admiration to a new level-you practically worship one of these two. This could be because you saw one of them perform a particularly impressive act of bravery at some point in the past, or maybe they just happened to give you the exact right words of encouragement or a kind gift at some point a few years ago when you were young and impressionable. In any case, they've done your best to emulate your hero's talents at spellcasting or combat. If your hero is Ameiko, you gain a +2 bonus on concentration checks. If your hero is Shalelu, you gain a +1 bonus to your AC against attacks of opportunity. In addition, you gain a +1 trait bonus on all attack rolls against foes that threaten your hero. NPC Choices: Ameiko, Shalelu. |",
			"| [Historian of the Rebellion](trait/historian_of_the_rebellion) | Hell's Rebels | You've long been interested in the legacy of the Silver Ravens-a group of freedom fighters that rose to prominence in Kintargo during the Chelish Civil War. There's frustratingly little information today about the group, and you suspect that most of what was recorded about the Silver Ravens has long since been redacted or destroyed by government agents, but You've managed to pick up a tidbit here and there. Most of your knowledge isn't so much about the Silver Ravens specifically, but more about general histories of rebel groups and freedom fighters who have fought against oppressive governments throughout history, both in Cheliax and beyond. |",
			"| [Ilizmagorti Native](trait/ilizmagorti_native) | Skull and Shackles | You grew up in the city of Ilizmagorti on Mediogalti Island, a pirate port infamous for both the scoundrels who visit it and the feared Red Mantis assassins who run it. You've been around pirates all your life, but You've learned to be wary in your dealings with people, as there's no telling who might be a Red Mantis in disguise. You gain a +1 trait bonus on Sense Motive checks, and Sense Motive is a class skill for you. In addition, your familiarity with the pirate's life allows you to make untrained Knowledge (local) checks regarding pirates or the region of the Shackles. |",
			"| [Infernal Bastard](trait/infernal_bastard) | Council of Thieves | You are a tiefling. You might be an escaped slave, a hidden shame, or a homeless vagabond, but whatever your upbringing, life has been particularly hard on you. You have suffered greatly, nearly starving to death one winter, nearly being beaten to death by racist sailors one summer, and so on. Whether or not these experiences have made you a bitter and cynical scoundrel or a pious and hopeful optimist is up to you, but one thing is certain-you are something less than even your tiefling kin. Perhaps it is a result of your hard life, or perhaps it is due to some fault in your fiendish heritage, but you lack a tiefling's standard resistances to cold, electricity, and fire-instead, you merely have a +2 bonus on all saving throws made against these effects. Likewise, you do not have the ability to use darkness as a spell-like ability once per day-instead, you may choose any one 0-level spell that you can instead use at will as a spell-like ability. |",
			"| [Inquisitive Archaeologist](trait/inquisitive_archaeologist) | Mummy's Mask | You have studied the architectural styles of nations throughout the Inner Sea region, but none have fascinated you like the architecture of Ancient Osirion. Hearing that the famed necropolis of Wati has finally been opened for exploration, you've come to that city to get firsthand experience with the lost secrets of Ancient Osirion's master builders. You gain a +2 trait bonus on Knowledge (engineering) checks, and that skill is always a class skill for you. In addition, you gain a +2 trait bonus on Perception checks to find concealed or secret doors in structures built in the style of Ancient Osirion. |",
			"| [Inspired by Greatness](trait/inspired_by_greatness) | Carrion Crown | Whether you knew Professor Lorrimor well or only in passing, as a colleague or competitor, his career and lifetime of discovery inspired you to be better at what you do. As you honed your craft, you and the professor corresponded, and he was delighted to hear that he had directly or indirectly motivated you to strive for your full potential. Saddened by the news of his death, you feel that you should honor his memory by fulfilling his final wishes and attending his funeral, and by ever striving to attain greater heights and someday match the influence and impact of your idol. |",
			"| [Into Enemy Territory](trait/into_enemy_territory) | Second Darkness | The shadow in the sky is visible from all around Riddleport, not just in town. It's certainly come to the attention of several druids, rangers, and other rural folk who dwell in the nearby mountains, forests, and swamps-among them, yourself. You've consulted with several seers and Harrowers, and may even have performed some simple auguries yourself, and all the signs point the same way-something or someone in Riddleport is connected to the blot, and it means bad news for the region. You've avoided the sleazy, dirty town for most of your life, traveling there only when absolutely necessary, and although you don't relish the prospect of going there now, you see little other choice (especially if one of your superiors is ordering you to go investigate). Fortunately, an eccentric friend of yours (pick another PC) is in town, and You've heard this friend will be taking part in some gambling thing at a place called the Gold Goblin. Your friend's always had better luck interacting with the cityfolk, so You've decided to accompany your friend to this gambling tournament and plan on letting him find a safe place for you to stay while you're in town. Your long life of self-sustenance has toughened you and made you more resistant to hardship, in any event-pick one of the three categories of saving throw. You gain a +1 trait bonus on all saving throws of that type. |",
			"| [Intrigued by Thassilon](trait/intrigued_by_thassilon) | Return of the Runelords | The rediscovery of Thassilon's legacy several years ago was an eye-opener for many, including you. After living so long in the shadow of these enormous ruins, you were intrigued to find out that they were much older than anyone could have guessed and that the runelords who built them may still exist. You've made a promise to yourself to uncover all that you can about Thassilon, its runelords, and the mysterious history of that ancient civilization. |",
			"| [Ironfang Survivor](trait/ironfang_survivor) | Ironfang Invasion | Whether you were serving in the military or simply beset by a surprise attack, you barely survived an encounter with the Ironfang Legion, one of Molthune's infamous monster regiments. Maybe you even survived the horrors of the Ramgate Massacre. You can't scrub the memories of their brutality from your waking or sleeping mind, and you keenly recall their distinctive fighting styles. You gain a +2 dodge bonus to AC against goblinoids, and once per day when you attempt an Intimidate, Sense Motive, or Stealth check against a goblinoid, you can roll two dice and use the better result. |",
			"| [Issian](trait/issian) | Kingmaker | You were raised northern Brevoy, a land of misty shores and harsh hill lands, of snowy vistas and violet-hued mountains. You are descended from an able and intelligent people, and you have grand ambitions, a mind alert for opportunity, and the tenacity to fight for your goals no matter the challenge. You care for little more than achieving your aspirations and opportunities to win wealthy and grandeur, for which few costs prove too great. You see yourself as a citizen of Brevoy through and through. The call for champions willing to help take back your country's rightful holdings in the Stolen Lands has inflamed your dreams of profit and possibilities, so you have joined an expedition to quest south. Your agile mind grants you a +1 trait bonus on all Will saves made to resist mind-affecting effects. |",
			"| [Jenivere Crew](trait/jenivere_crew) | Serpent's Skull | This trip to Eleder is just one of many in a long career as a sailor aboard the Jenivere and other cargo vessels. Whether you joined the crew with the hope of one day captaining your own ship, as the means of paying your way to a foreign port with sweat and blood, or as a slave or indentured servant, you now call the ship home. Pick one of the following skills: Acrobatics, Climb, Knowledge (nature), Knowledge (geography), Swim, or Survival. You gain a +1 trait bonus on that skill, and that skill is always treated as a class skill for you. |",
			"| [Kraggodan Castaway](trait/kraggodan_castaway) | dwarf; Ironfang Invasion | You hail from the dwarven Sky Citadel of Kraggodan in southern Nirmathas and have spent the past several years among the surface people serving as a mercenary in the war, trading with Nirmathi towns, or simply seeing the surface world. Molthune's recent siege of Kraggodan has squelched any hopes you had of returning home, and now you struggle to find a home on the surface. Thanks to your travels, you gain one of the following as a bonus language: Common, Hallit, Varisian, or Undercommon. In addition, your homesickness means time spent underground revitalizes your spirits; whenever you are underground-either in natural caverns or an artificial complex-you automatically stabilize if brought below 0 hit points, and if reduced to 0 hit points (or you are stable and conscious when below 0 hit points) you do not take the usual 1 point of damage disabled characters take from performing a standard action. This revitalizing effect fades after 4 consecutive days spent underground, but returns after you spend more than a week above ground again. |",
			"| [Local Ties](trait/local_ties) | Iron Gods | You have ties to a prominent local in the town of Torch-the missing wizard Khonnir Baine. If you're a wizard, alchemist, or other scholarly type, he may have been your tutor or teacher. If you're of a more martial bent, Khonnir could instead have been a friend or business associate of your mother, father, or patron. He may even have been your adoptive father, in which case you likely have a bond of friendship or rivalry with his adopted daughter Val (your GM has more information on her in this case if you wish to know more for your character's background). Your association with Khonnir has given you insight into how technology works. Choose Disable Device or Knowledge (engineering). You gain a +1 trait bonus on checks with this skill, and it is a class skill for you. In addition, you are treated as if you possessed the Technologist feat for the purposes of resolving checks associated with that skill. If you gain the Technologist feat, your trait bonus for the selected skill increases to +3. |",
			"| [Local Tough](trait/local_tough) | Hell's Vengeance | You were born and raised in the town of Longacre on the southwestern fringes of the Whisperwood, or at least have lived there long enough that you're considered a native. You've never been one for the quiet life, and have been considered a miscreant and reprobate since you were a child. As an adult, You've made something of a name for yourself as a thug, enforcer, and petty thief in town, hiring yourself out to anybody who needs muscle in exchange for a few coins. In the course of such employment, You've worked with another local troublemaker named Cimri Staelish and have become friends. Cimri has recently gotten involved with some shadowy, though powerful, characters, and as Hell's Vengeance begins, you and a group of other ne-erdo- wells have agreed to help Cimri burgle a tannery just outside town. With luck, this could be the start of bigger and better things than just working as hired muscle. You gain a +1 trait bonus on Intimidate checks, and Intimidate is a class skill for you. In addition, you gain a +1 trait bonus on weapon damage rolls when you are flanking a foe with an ally. |",
			"| [Looking for Work](trait/looking_for_work) | Second Darkness | Although out of work, you aren't particularly keen on the prospect of gambling away your last remaining coins simply for a chance at riches. That said, if the Gold Goblin's fortunes reverse after this big gambling tournament, you're relatively certain its owner, Saul Vancaskerkin, will be needing to hire on some new staff members. You've secured payment for the tournament, and intend on attending mostly to check the place out, to decide if it's a place you'd want to work at (as a bouncer, bartender, croupier, server, entertainer, spotter, or cook), and hopefully get a chance to catch Saul's eye and make an impression. You've long worked at honing your skills, and are quite accomplished and certain that you have something to offer. Pick one of the following skills: Bluff, Craft (any), Diplomacy, Intimidate, Perform (any), Profession (gambler), or Spot. You gain a +1 trait bonus in that skill, and that skill is always considered a class skill for you. |",
			"| [Love Lost](trait/love_lost) | Curse of the Crimson Throne | Someone you loved was knifed to death in a dark alley one night. You were called to the scene by the Korvosan Guard to identify the body, and as rough as that was for you, you also noticed a ring was missing from your loved one's finger. Whoever murdered your loved one stole that ring- you're convinced of it. You've done some investigation on your own and recently found the ring for sale at a local merchant's shop. To your great frustration, you can't yet afford the 500 gp to buy it back, but the merchant did tell you from whom he purchased the ring: a man named Gaedren Lamm. It seems likely this criminal killed your loved one, or at the very least, he knows who did. The only problem is finding him. |",
			"| [Making Good on Promises](trait/making_good_on_promises) | Carrion Crown | At some point in the past, Professor Lorrimor did you a favor under the condition that he would someday call on you to repay it. After he came to your aid, however, you never saw nor heard from him again, leaving you with a sense of unending anticipation that each day might be the day you were asked to return the favor. Yet that day never came, and your fears and anxiety about what the professor would call on you to do abated. Assuming the old man had either forgotten about you or died, you eventually assumed you'd never have to follow through on your end of the bargain. When you received word of the professor's death, and that he had named you specifically in his will, your dread of what he could possibly want from you has grown throughout your entire journey to Ravengro. |",
			"| [Merchant Family](trait/merchant_family) | Rise of the Runelords | You are related to one of the four noble families from Magnimar who founded the Mercantile League of Sandpoint. You either grew up in Magnimar as a cousin in the Valdemar or Deverin family or were born and raised in Sandpoint. Education in running a business and years of looking after the family enterprise have given you a knack for trade. You increase the gp limit of any settlement by 20% and can resell items at an additional 10% over the amount of gp you normally would get from selling off treasure. |",
			"| [Methodical Mind](trait/methodical_mind) | Strange Aeons | When you awake with nothing but hazy memories, you begin carefully cataloging your thoughts to determine the reasons for your condition and where you might be. This comforts you, and you know deep down that you have always relied on your ordered mind and pragmatic approach to face challenges. You use this focus and sensibility to your advantage as you investigate your current dire situation. |",
			"| [Missing Child](trait/missing_child) | Curse of the Crimson Throne | You suspect that a child you know has been abducted by Gaedren Lamm. Whatever the relationship, you've heard rumors about \"Lamm's Lambs,\" and of how the old man uses children as pickpockets and agents for his crimes. you've even heard rumors that the child you're looking for has been spotted in the marketplaces in the company of known cutpurses and pickpockets. Although the Korvosan Guard has been understanding of your plight, it has its hands full with \"more important\" matters these days, it seems, and has not yet been able to learn anything more about Gaedren. No one else is interested in bringing Gaedren down and rescuing his victims' that task falls to you. Yet where could the old scoundrel be hiding? |",
			"| [Missionary](trait/missionary) | Legacy of Fire | You've spent much of the last several years serving your faith, and the conviction and dedication to your church has impressed many. Perhaps You've donated much of your personal wealth or time to serving the church, or you're the child of a powerful or well-loved member of the church, an orphan raised by the church, or a foundling with a strange birthmark that bears more than a passing resemblance to your faith's holy symbol. The faith has long supported you, and you are eager to repay the church in some way. In Katapesh, the establishment of a new village is always cause for interest to the nation's churches, as establishing new temples in villages is an excellent way to expand upon the church's resources and bring in more faithful. If the Pactmasters' plans to revitalize and rebuild Kelmarane are successful, the village will need a temple, and your faith is keenly interested in being represented there. This campaign trait is particularly suited to worshipers of Sarenrae, as Kelmarane was founded near an old monastery dedicated to the Dawnflower, and reconsecrating that monastery is of great interest to Sarenrae's church. Furthermore, a temple dedicated to her once stood in Kelmarane itself, but it has long since fallen into ruin; whispers among the religion tell that the church's old pastor may have fallen from grace and may even have been part of the cause of the hard times that befell the village. You've joined Garavel's band in hopes of helping to establish a new temple in the soon-to-be revitalized village. You've been selected for your dedication to the church and your strong social graces-pick one of the following skills: Bluff, Diplomacy, Intimidate, Knowledge (religion), Perform (any), or Sense Motive. You gain a +1 trait bonus on checks using that skill, and it is always considered a class skill for you. |",
			"| [Monster Hunter](trait/monster_hunter) | Rise of the Runelords | Perhaps you came to the Varisian Gulf in search of the Sandpoint Devil, or maybe you followed fisherman's tales of Old Murdermaw- regardless, you've ventured through Varisia to hunt down famous monsters. While they have all eluded you so far, you made it to Sandpoint to research and restock before heading back out into the wilderness. Because of your training, you gain a +1 trait bonus on attack rolls and weapon damage rolls against aberrations and magical beasts. |",
			"| [Monument Scholar](trait/monument_scholar) | Shattered Star | As a child in Magnimar, the city's ancient monuments inspired you with wonder. Your fascination with these relics has only grown in the years since, encouraging you to join the ranks of the Pathfinder Society so you can further quench your thirst for knowledge. Though you know little about the actual lore of the monuments, you've studied these colossal works extensively, developing an in-depth knowledge of some of the city's most famous landmarks. You gain a +1 trait bonus on Knowledge (history) checks made in Varisia due to your familiarity with its historical remnants. This bonus increases to +2 if the check relates to the city of Magnimar. Additionally, you gain a +2 trait bonus on any skill check made to receive a boon from one of Magnimar's magically imbued monuments (see Magnimar, City of Monuments for more details). |",
			"| [Mummy-Cursed](trait/mummy-cursed) | Mummy's Mask | One of your ancestors ran afoul of a mummy's curse while exploring an ancient tomb. This curse was passed down to later generations of your family, but over time, your line has become more resistant to curses. You've come to Wati to explore its untouched necropolis, and while you hope you won't have to face a real undead mummy, at least you have some defense if you do. You gain a +2 trait bonus on saving throws against curses and curse effects (including mummy rot and spells with the curse descriptor) and a +2 trait bonus on saving throws against a mummy's aura of despair. |",
			"| [Mwangi Scholar](trait/mwangi_scholar) | Serpent's Skull | The Mwangi Expanse is one of the richest regions in all of Golarion, and also one of the most mysterious. Despite its history of countless years and its fostering of nameless empires, very little is known of the Mwangi Expanse by outsiders or even natives of the primeval, jungle-covered land. You have long studied the region and its lore, and count yourself among a small handful of genuine experts throughout the Inner Sea. The Jenivere promises to take you to the very subject of your fascination, and you eagerly await firsthand investigation of the deep jungles and cyclopean ruins of Garund's interior. You gain Polyglot as a bonus language and receive a +1 trait bonus on all Knowledge (history) checks regarding the Mwangi Expanse. |",
			"| [Natural Born Leader (HR)](trait/natural_born_leader_hr) | Hell's Rebels | Whenever you found yourself involved in a group effort in the past, be it working with siblings to handle a family emergency, conspiring with friends to orchestrate a prank, or throwing in with coworkers to take care of an unanticipated complication at work, you tended to end up in a position of leadership. It might be unclear to you why this is the case, or you might deliberately seek out such positions, knowing you can organize any group to be something greater than the sum of its parts, but your knack for managing groups has always pushed you to the front of any operation you've found yourself a part of. |",
			"| [Noble Born](trait/noble_born) | Kingmaker | You claim a tangential but legitimate connection to one of Brevoy's noble families. If you aren't human, you were likely adopted by one of Brevoy's nobles or were instead a favored servant or even a childhood friend of a noble scion. Whatever the cause, you've had a comfortable life, but one far from the dignity and decadence your distant cousins know. Although you are associated with an esteemed name, your immediate family is hardly well to do, and you've found your name to be more of a burden to you than a boon in many social situations. you've recently decided to test yourself, to see if you can face the world without the aegis of a name you have little real claim or care for. An expedition into the storied Stolen Lands seems like just the test to see if you really are worth the title \"noble.\" Choose one of the following noble families and associated benefits. |",
			"| [Nontraditional Native](trait/nontraditional_native) | Shattered Star | You are a member of the Shoanti or Varisian ethnicity who left your people to learn more about the mysteries of your strange homeland. Your travels have recently brought you to the Pathfinder lodge in Magnimar. Although none of your family members are present, you carry them and your family traditions with you. |",
			"| [Northern Ancestry](trait/northern_ancestry) | Reign of Winter | One of your parents came from the North, and the tales of the frozen lands at the top of the world that you grew up listening to excited your imagination. Alternatively, maybe one of your ancestors passed on the blood of some frost-rimed creature. You feel most alive during the chill of winter, and as a child, you spent hours playing in the snow. You rarely feel the cold, and you've always had a restless longing to travel north. You gain a +1 trait bonus on Fortitude saves, as well as cold resistance 2; this resistance does not stack with cold resistance gained from any other source. |",
			"| [Numerian Archaeologist](trait/numerian_archaeologist) | Iron Gods | Numeria is a land ripe for archaeological exploration, since so many of the strange technological dungeons have been either avoided by the superstitious barbarian tribes or have been locked down by the Technic League, leaving many of them untouched and ripe for exploration. You've studied the strange language associated with these eerie technological ruins, and are eager to start exploring them-you suspect that Torch's namesake is in fact part of a larger buried ruin, and you hope to enter these ruins and learn their original purpose by exploring the caves below town. You gain Androffan as an additional language. In addition, you possess a knack for technological items; when you use a timeworn technological item, roll twice when determining any glitches the item might cause and choose which result to use as your actual result. Talk to your GM for more information about resolving glitches. |",
			"| [On the Payroll](trait/on_the_payroll) | Carrion Crown | Whether he needed a bodyguard in a rough neighborhood, a guide to an isolated archeological dig, or information on a specialized topic, Professor Lorrimor was never shy about hiring professionals to help him attain his goals. Over the course of his long career, thousands of people throughout the world served his needs and benefited from his generous wages (usually covered by his academic benefactor at the time). He had contacts in most areas of expertise in every corner of the known world, a knack for recognizing talent, and a desire to be surrounded by the best and brightest at all times. Whatever job the professor originally hired you for, your performance captured his attention, and he hired you many times throughout your career, sometimes even for jobs away from your home, always paying your expenses and compensating you well for your time. In your area of expertise, you are among the best. |",
			"| [Optimistic Gambler](trait/optimistic_gambler) | Second Darkness | You've always seemed to have trouble keeping money. Worse, you always seem to have debts looming over your head. When you heard about the \"Cheat the Devil and Take His Gold\" gambling tournament, you felt in your gut that your luck was about to change. You've always been optimistic, in fact, and even though right now is one of those rare times where you don't owe anyone any money (you just paid off a recent loan from local moneylender Lymas Smeed), you know that'll change soon enough. Better to start amassing money now when you're at one of those rare windfall times! You've set aside a gold coin for the entrance fee, and look forward to making it big-you can feel it in your bones! This time's gonna be the big one! Your boundless optimism, even in the face of crushing situations, has always bolstered your spirit. Effects that grant you morale bonuses persist 1d4 rounds longer than they normally would as a result. |",
			"| [Orphaned by Giants](trait/orphaned_by_giants) | Giantslayer | You grew up in a tranquil, happy home near the mountains, but that peace was shattered when giants came down from the mountains to raid your settlement. The giants killed your parents and left you a young orphan, and since that day, you've sworn to avenge the deaths of your kin. You gain a +1 trait bonus on attack rolls against creatures with the giant subtype, and a +2 trait bonus on rolls to confirm critical hits against creatures with the giant subtype. |",
			"| [Outlander](trait/outlander) |  | You are not from town; you've recently come from somewhere else and are hoping to make your fortune here. Pick one of the following reasons to be a newcomer to the area. |",
			"| [Pathfinder Recruit](trait/pathfinder_recruit) | Ruins of Azlant | Explore, report, and cooperate. This is the credo you've lived by since you've joined the Pathfinder Society, and after hearing about the expedition to found Talmandor's Bounty you applied, eager to see the remains of Azlant. However, you quickly learned that the Bountiful Venture Company wasn't interested in involving the Pathfinder Society in the formation of the colony. This struck you as strange, because who else has as keen an understanding of some of the elements of ancient Azlant as the Pathfinder Society? Regardless, you went through the application process, making sure to highlight all of your applicable skills and experience while keeping your involvement in the Society to yourself. You were elated to receive notice that you were selected for the second wave of colonists bound for the broken continent of Azlant. You begin play with a standard [wayfinder](magic/wondrous/wayfinder) and you gain a +1 trait bonus on initiative checks. |",
			"| [Pattern Seeker](trait/pattern_seeker) | Hell's Rebels | There are patterns in the world, both natural and artificial, that if only one can interpret them correctly, great secrets could be divined. You have long been fascinated by the idea of these hidden patterns, perhaps because a sibling or parent went to the grave obsessed with seeking a pattern, or maybe because you feel that you've uncovered a previously unknown pattern. Kintargo has a particularly unique pattern of its own; the belfry atop the Temple of Asmodeus rings at what seem to be random intervals. None know who or what rings the bells, and no true pattern by which the so-called Devil's Bells has yet accurately predicted the tolling. Many have tried, and extensive but always incomplete documents exist that track the dates and times of recorded ringings back to the end of the Chelish Civil War, when the church of Asmodeus first claimed the abandoned temple of Aroden as their own. Maybe you will be the one to solve the pattern of the Devil's Bells? |",
			"| [Peg Leg](trait/peg_leg) | Skull and Shackles | One of your legs was bitten off below the knee by a shark when you were just a child, and was replaced with a wooden peg leg. You've long since gotten used to your prosthesis, however, and take none of the normal penalties from having a peg leg. You've had to learn to deal with the pain of your injury as well, and you gain a +1 trait bonus on Fortitude saves. Ever since your accident You've hated sharks, and you also gain a +1 trait bonus on damage rolls against sharks and other animals with the aquatic subtype. |",
			"| [Pioneer](trait/pioneer) | Kingmaker | You have long lived along the southern border of Brevoy, in the shadow of wilderness known as the Stolen Lands. Life has been hard, but through hunting, trapping, trading, and coaxing crops from the freezing earth, you've learned how to survive on the rugged frontier. With the wilderness ever at your door, you've also learned much about its denizens and the wild creatures that lurk in that unwholesome land. Your family might even claim holdings in the Stolen Lands, with elders telling stories of being driven from or robbed of a lost ancestral homestead, fertile farmlands, bountiful orchards, or a hidden mining claim. Whether because of your personal expertise and familiarity with the borderlands or in order to reclaim your family's land, you've joined the expedition into the Stolen Lands. You begin play with a horse. Also, choose one of the following skills: Climb, Handle Animal, Knowledge (nature), Perception, Ride, Survival, or Swim-you gain a +1 trait bonus on this skill. |",
			"| [Portentous Perception](trait/portentous_perception) | Second Darkness | You've come (or been sent) to Riddleport to observe the strange Blot that has appeared in the city's sky. You've decided to put your keen senses to the test at the Golden Goblin's upcoming gambling competition while you're here. Your sharp eyesight makes it easier for you to notice things at a distance. For you, Perception checks only start increasing in difficulty at a range of 20 feet or farther, as opposed to the normal 10. This has no effect on checks made to perceive things within 10 feet. |",
			"| [Pugnacious](trait/pugnacious) | Strange Aeons | You awake in the asylum with sore muscles and bloody knuckles, as if you were recently in a fight. You even have a vague feeling that you won. You can't explain it, but you know that you've always been easy to set off, and your first instinct when pressed into a corner is to lash out. Stuck in the asylum sets you on edge, and you not only want to figure out what happened to you, you want to free yourself and find whoever did this to you-and make them pay. |",
			"| [Reclaiming your Roots](trait/reclaiming_your_roots) | Legacy of Fire | Your interest in the village of Kelmarane is more personal than most of the others who are heading out to aid in the reclamation. You aren't seeking revenge against gnolls, glory, money, or anything else-to you, this is purely a matter of honor, as Kelmarane is where you were born. Your were forced to flee the village when you were only a few years old, and you didn't discoverer this until a few years ago-perhaps you found an old document that revealed the truth, or maybe you learned the news from a relative. Both of your parents are now dead, and from what you've been able to piece together, one of your parents actually died in the village when whatever happened there happened. Your surviving parent spirited you away to safety to grow up elsewhere, but never spoke of Kelmarane and always told you that your other parent died when you were a child in a horrific tragedy like a fire or a flood that swept away the body. Now that you've started to uncover the truth, you are convinced that your heritage remains hidden in Kelmarane. Whether you just wish to find out what really happened to your parent that died there or you want to rebuild the village in his or her honor is up to you-but Garavel's caravan to the village is just the opportunity you've been waiting for. When your other parent died recently, among his or her effects was a single item that once belonged to the parent who died at Kelmarane. This item is your most valued possession-a piece of jewelry worth 350 gp, any masterwork weapon or armor worth no more than 350 gp, or a wand containing any 1st-level spell (CL 1st) with only 20 charges remaining. If you ever lose this item, your resulting depression imposes a -1 penalty on Will saves for 1 year. |",
			"| [Rescued](trait/rescued) | Jade Regent | At some point in the past, you had a terrifyingly close brush with death. Maybe a goblin nearly killed you during an attack on the town, or perhaps a building struck by a giant's boulder collapsed around you. Whatever the peril was, you would have certainly died if not for the swift actions of Koya or Shalelu, who intervened just in time to save your life. You've never forgotten this, and remain fiercely loyal to the NPC who saved you. Perhaps even more importantly, the method in which she saved you seems to have had an impact on your own skills. If Koya saved you, she did so by casting a healing spell on you just before you died, and as a result you gain a +2 trait bonus whenever you use cure spells to heal damage. If it was Shalelu who saved you, she did so by pulling you to safety while simultaneously defeating the peril that almost did you in, and as a result, you gain a +1 trait bonus on Acrobatics checks and Acrobatics is a class skill for you. In addition, you gain a +1 trait bonus on all attack rolls against foes that threaten your savior. NPC Choices: Koya, Shalelu. |",
			"| [Researching the Blot](trait/researching_the_blot) | Second Darkness | You may or may not be seeking membership into Riddleport's most prestigious magical guild, the Order of Cyphers, but you certainly have heard their call for aid in determining the nature of the strange shadow in the sky above Riddleport. You arrived in town several days ago and had some issues with security and safety at several inns before you finally settled on the Gold Goblin; you've been staying there as a guest for several days now, and the owner, Saul Vancaskerkin, seems like a nice guy. He's even given you a pass to attend the gambling tournament he's about to throw-you're not sure how into gambling you'll be, but perhaps there'll be some visitors from out of town you can talk to about the strange shadow in the sky. At the very least, you're hoping someone at the tourney will be into magic-there's not really enough folk in this town who seem all that interested in magic, you've found. Your interest in magic dates back quite far, and as a result, you've developed a knack for identifying common magical items at a glance. You can use Spellcraft to identify magic items in the same way you can use Spellcraft to identify a potion. The DC to identify a magic item is equal to 20 + the item's caster level. |",
			"| [Resourceful](trait/resourceful) | Ruins of Azlant | You've always had a knack for building and repairing things. As a kid, you always got into your parents' tools and tinkered with things around the house. As you got older, you started making things not only to entertain yourself but also to take in a little extra money. People have noticed your skill and have frequently come to you to make something for them or to repair a pesky device or item. Every time You've amazed them at how quickly you do your work and how few resources you squander in the process. Likewise, the Bountiful Venture Company noticed your skill at not only creating wonderful wares, but also how effortlessly and efficiently you work in your trade. You always seem to make do with less, often in unexpected ways. |",
			"| [Restless Wayfarer](trait/restless_wayfarer) | Reign of Winter | You have long led a nomadic life-perhaps because your parents were travelers (whether roaming Varisian caravaneers or traveling merchants who traded far and wide), you belonged to a nomadic tribe, or you ran away from home to discover the world at a young age. Some call it wanderlust, but to you the thought of new places and experiences is truly what makes life worth living, and no region catches your imagination like the windswept wilderness of the North. You are used to getting along in unfamiliar lands and interacting with interesting new people. You gain a +1 trait bonus on Knowledge (geography) and Knowledge (local) checks, and one of these skills (your choice) is a class skill for you. You can also speak one additional language (this does not count toward your number of languages). |",
			"| [Resurrected](trait/resurrected) | Mummy's Mask | At some time in the recent past you died, but you were brought back to life-whether because of magic, a blessing of the gods, a destiny you have to fulfill, or perhaps it just wasn't your time to die yet. Whatever the nature of your resurrection, your experience gave you a fascination with death, and you hope to find some insight into the nature of mortality by exploring the tombs of Wati's famous necropolis. You gain a +2 trait bonus on saving throws against death effects. In addition, you do not die until your hit points drop to a negative amount equal to or lower than your Constitution score + 4. |",
			"| [Riftwarden Orphan](trait/riftwarden_orphan) | Wrath of the Righteous | You bear a strange birthmark on your body-something you've learned is the Sign of the Seeker's Spiral, a rune associated with the secret society known as the Riftwardens. You have researched this rune, and have learned that the mark sometimes appears on the children of Riftwardens who have been exposed to particularly strange planar energies. Unfortunately, you never knew your parents, for you were raised by a foster family in Kenabres. Your foster family has confirmed that both of your parents were Riftwardens, and has further confirmed that your parents went missing on a secret mission into the Worldwound less than a month after you were born. You're not sure what happened to them, but you're certain you're dead-and your gut tells you that the one who murdered them yet lives! In any event, you've long felt magic in your blood, and casting spells comes easily to you. You gain a +2 trait bonus on all concentration checks. |",
			"| [Rising Star](trait/rising_star) | War for the Crown | All too often, great minds must suffer for their art, but you're one of the lucky ones. Your skills attracted the attention of a noble patron who pays for your food, housing, and tools. As your patron introduces you to other cultural elites, you're slowly learning to navigate the treacherous waters of high society, but you still remember the lean times when each meal was a hard-won treasure. You gain a +1 trait bonus on Sense Motive and Survival checks, as well as checks using a single Craft or Perform skill of your choice; one of these skills is always a class skill for you. Once each day, you can invoke your patron's reputation or name one of your own prominent works to gain a +2 circumstance bonus on a single Bluff, Diplomacy, or Intimidate check. You begin the game with a masterwork musical instrument or tool appropriate to the Craft or Perform skill you selected, a gift from your patron. |",
			"| [Ritualistic](trait/ritualistic) | Strange Aeons | You awake with a sense of purpose and a tingle of magical power. Though it's unsettling that you can't recall your past, you have a hunch that if you and your companions do everything just right-follow the correct steps and order-the answers will reveal themselves and you will be free of your condition. You get the feeling that you've always fallen back on careful planning and time-tested evidence in the past, but a nagging sensation also tells you that you used these skills in less-than-kind ways all too recently. |",
			"| [Robot Slayer](trait/robot_slayer) | Iron Gods | The strange automatons that plague the wilds of Numeria are a blight upon the world, and the idea that there could be countless more of these creatures lying in wait in the unknown ruins scattered throughout the region chills your blood. Khonnir's recovery of a deactivated robot from the caves below Torch worries you-not only could that thing wake up and run amok in town, but there may well be more lurking below! You want to explore the caves under Torch to determine if there is indeed a lurking robot threat below town. You gain a +1 trait bonus on attack rolls against robots and a +1 dodge bonus to AC against attacks made by robots. |",
			"| [Roll With It](trait/roll_with_it) | Giantslayer | You've trained with some of the best giantslayers out there, and have learned how to avoid the worst effects of a giant's powerful attacks. You gain a +1 trait bonus on Reflex saves. In addition, once per day, when a creature with the giant subtype successfully confirms a critical hit against you with a weapon or a slam attack (not a spell or special ability), you can roll with the attack. You take normal damage from the blow, as if the critical had not been confirmed. You must be aware of the attack and able to react to it-if you are denied your Dexterity bonus to AC, you can't use this ability. If you are a dwarf or a gnome, you can use this ability twice per day. |",
			"| [Rostlander](trait/rostlander) | Kingmaker | You were raised in the south of Brevoy, a land of dense forests and rolling plains, of crystalline rivers and endless sapphire skies. You come from hearty stock and were raised with simple sensibilities of hard work winning well-deserved gains, the importance of charity and compassion, and the value of personal and familial honor. Yours is the country of the Aldori swordlords and the heroes who refused to bend before the armies of a violent conqueror. You care little for matters of politics and nobles or of deception and schemes. As you are thoroughly Brevic, the call for champions willing to expand your land's influence into the Stolen Lands has inflamed your sense of patriotism and honor, and so you have joined an expedition to quest southward. Your hardy nature grants you a +1 trait bonus on all Fortitude saves. |",
			"| [Ruin Raider](trait/ruin_raider) | Shattered Star | While the mercantile industries of Magnimar appeal to your keen eye for monetary gain, you know that the boldest route to true fortune lays in hunting down rare relics and selling them to the highest bidder. Becoming a Pathfinder seemed like an obvious decision, allowing you to travel throughout Varisia in your search for wealth, so you signed up right away. You brought with you a sharp eye and keen ability to distinguish fakes from the genuine article. You gain a +1 trait bonus on Appraise checks. Additionally, you gain a +4 bonus on Perception checks made to distinguish statue-like creatures (like caryatid columns and gargoyles) from actual sculptures. |",
			"| [Sandpoint Faithful](trait/sandpoint_faithful) | Rise of the Runelords | As a faithful adherent of Abadar, Desna, Erastil, Gozreh, Sarenrae, or Shelyn, you've come to the Swallowtail Festival to celebrate the consecration of Sandpoint Cathedral. You gain a silver holy symbol of your chosen deity, and so long as you worship that deity and openly wear his or her symbol, you regain +1 additional hit point every time you receive magical healing. |",
			"| [Scholar of the Ancients](trait/scholar_of_the_ancients) | Rise of the Runelords | Growing up with your nose in books, you've had a great interest in past cultures and ancient history. Furthermore, having grown up in Varisia, you know the monuments dotting the landscape belong to an ancient civilization known as Thassilon. From your life of study and dogged research, you've pieced together the language and partial history of this once-great empire. You gain a +1 trait bonus on Knowledge (arcana) and Knowledge (history) checks, and begin play able to speak and read Thassilonian. |",
			"| [Scion of Legend](trait/scion_of_legend) | Return of the Runelords | Your character has a personal link or association with one of Varisia's established heroes. This hero should be a PC you played in a previous campaign (and could be, but need not be, one of the Sihedron Heroes). Your character could be a younger sibling, younger cousin, or even an apprentice of the hero. If enough time has passed, you might be the hero's child, or your character could have reincarnated from the soul of a hero that died before your character was born. |",
			"| [Scion of the Nine Circles](trait/scion_of_the_nine_circles) | Hell's Vengeance | While the worship of [Asmodeus](faith/asmodeus) is widespread throughout Cheliax, you follow a different path: that of the philosophy of diabolism. Asmodeus and the other archdevils are worthy of respect and emulation, certainly, but rather than worship one Lord of Hell above all others, your faith is instead based on the veneration of the order and laws of Hell itself as a model for a perfect society. Free will must be suppressed to prevent rebellion, slavery is required to keep the unworthy in their place, and evil and cruelty are necessary for good and kindness to exist. |",
			"| [Scouting for Fiends](trait/scouting_for_fiends) | Second Darkness | You belong to an organization (most likely a religion) that has definite views on the menace posed by the lower planes. The willfulness with which the city of Korvosa (they even allow a temple of Asmodeus to operate in broad daylight!) tolerates infernal influences is, to you and your organization, the greatest symbol of what's wrong with civilization today. And now, in Riddleport, there's news that a gambling tournament is using devils and Hell as an idle decoration. It's likely that this is just an example of poor taste, but there's a chance that something sinister may be lurking beneath the goings-on at the Gold Goblin. You have been contacted by your organization (or may have decided on your own) to travel to Riddleport (if you don't already live there) and attend this tournament under the guise of a patron. Keep an eye on things there, even after the tournament is over; if you can, get a job working for the owner. Demons and devils can be subtle, and it could take weeks or even months to find proof of their involvement. Your near-obsessive hatred of all things fiendish grants you a +1 trait bonus on all attack rolls made against foes you know to be evil outsiders. |",
			"| [Seasoned Hunter](trait/seasoned_hunter) | Ruins of Azlant | You grew up hunting every season, any season. Maybe you grew up in a rural area and hunted to put food on the table, or perhaps you come from a comfortable lifestyle where hunting for sport is an excellent excuse to camp in the wilderness and hone your skills. After sharing stories of your most exciting hunts and proving to them that you can hit a bull's eye at 100 feet, the Bountiful Venture Company selected you for the expedition assured that you can provide food and security to the young colony. |",
			"| [Seeking Adventure](trait/seeking_adventure) | Legacy of Fire | The Pathfinder Society has long intrigued you-tales of the exotic lands and strange discoveries made by Pathfinders have enchanted your dreams and fired your imagination since childhood. When Pathfinders came through your village or neighborhood, they immediately enthralled you with their stories and knowledge. Yet at the time, you were far too young to join them, and when they left for adventure you had to stay behind. Now that you are of age, you've traveled to Absalom to apply for membership. The application process went well, and you're now a full member. Your first assignment is to accompany Garavel's group to Kelmarane-the Pathfinder Society has heard rumors of several ancient structures in the area, including a ruined monastery once dedicated to Sarenrae, and would like to learn more about them. Even more pressing is the mystery of what brought about Kelmarane's ruin in the first place-reports of which are vague at best. If you can determine the cause of the village's abandonment so many years ago, you're sure the Society would be impressed. You begin the game with your own wayfinder, a loan from your venture-captain. you've promised to pay your venturecaptain 500 gp for the wayfinder some day, but for now it's yours to use. A wayfinder is a magical compass that grants you a +2 circumstance bonus on Survival checks to avoid becoming lost, and can be commanded to emit light as the spell (CL 5th) as a standard action. Further details on the Pathfinder Society and wayfinders may be found in the Pathfinder Chronicles Campaign Setting (pages 194-195) or Seekers of Secrets. |",
			"| [Senatorial Hopeful](trait/senatorial_hopeful) | War for the Crown | While you belong to a noble family, hailing from the outlying prefectures means you lack the pull and wealth needed to rub shoulders with the stars of Oppara's social scene. Your life has been quiet, isolated from the thrum of fashion and pop culture, but you see this as a source of insight and aim to help people by someday joining the senate. It'll be a long journey, but you've already begun learning which hands to shake and how to listen carefully when others tell you what they want. You gain a +1 bonus on Diplomacy and Knowledge (local) checks, and both of these skills are always class skills for you. Once each week you can call on family connections to obtain a single piece of equipment or consumable magic item (such as a potion or scroll) worth up to your character level &times; 25 gp. Delivery of the goods you request takes 1d4 days. At 10th level, the potential value of a magical item increases to your character level &times; 50 gp, and your requests can also include spellcasting services and wands. |",
			"| [Sensitive Mind](trait/sensitive_mind) | Strange Aeons | You awake in the asylum horribly aware of dangers lurking nearby. While your memories are hazy and indistinct, everything around you looks vibrant and clear. You have an inkling that you have always been perceptive and can tell a lot about a person even in a quick meeting. This sensitivity can overwhelm you at times, especially in your current situation. |",
			"| [Serpent Runner](trait/serpent_runner) | Shattered Star | You've participated in the mock gladiatorial battles and athletic feats at the Serpent's Run, Magnimar's grand hippodrome, but the safe nature of those games leaves you bored. Seeking greater thrills and tests of your abilities, You've pledged your arms and skill to the local Pathfinder lodge. Choose one of the following benefits to represent the techniques you learned from your time at the Serpent's Run: |",
			"| [Set Mind](trait/set_mind) | Ruins of Azlant | Every time that you've said you'd do something, you've made sure to follow through. You can't remember a time when you weren't this way. People have a hard time making you change your mind once you've set yourself on a certain path. You might be exceptionally stubborn or you may just have a particular determination. Either way, you're going to keep doing what you set your mind to. The Bountiful Venture Company recognized this useful trait of yours and selected you for the second wave of colonists because of your great resolve and unswerving dedication to what you set your mind upon. |",
			"| [Shadow Child](trait/shadow_child) | Council of Thieves | Westcrown has long suffered under a peculiar curse, a blight that rises every night, bringing with it fell beasts that hunt the shadows. No one can say from whence these night-horrors come-though some blame the mysterious wizards of Nidal, other claim that it's some curse laid by fallen Aroden, while still others suggest some shadowy mastermind manipulates an ebon brood from the depths of Westcrown's northern ruins. Whatever the case, the people of Westcrown have long feared the night, but not you. You're goal is to reclaim the darkness from the beasts that hide within. You've acclimated yourself to the dark, and thus act with greater precision in the shadow than most. When attacking targets in areas of dim light, you do not suffer the standard 20% miss chance on attack rolls for being in the poorly lit area. |",
			"| [Ship's Surgeon](trait/ship's_surgeon) | Skull and Shackles | On a ship, a sailor often has to learn multiple skills, and this rule certainly applies to you. Your father was a woodworker, and you learned your first trade from him. But on your first voyage at sea you quickly found out that a carpenter is often a ship's doctor as well-after all, who knows more about sawing off limbs than someone who saws wood for a living? People are a lot bloodier than wood, that's for sure, but you haven't had many complaints-those sailors who have enjoyed your services are either happy to be alive or dead, and there's old salts who swear the peg legs you for made them are better than the real legs they used to have. You gain a +1 trait bonus on Craft (carpentry) and Heal checks, and Heal is a class skill for you. |",
			"| [Skillful](trait/skillful) | Ruins of Azlant | You've always been interested in a wide array of things, and growing up You've spent time honing some of these talents, which has helped you in life. Some have attributed your successes to luck, but others have recognized what you truly have- skill. This interest in and practice of a diverse array of skills and abilities has served you well in a number of different jobs, and following in your varied interests you learned of the expedition to the ruins of Azlant. After your application, the Bountiful Venture Company selected you for the expedition because your skillful approach to matters would be helpful for a growing colony. |",
			"| [Skymetal Smith](trait/skymetal_smith) | Iron Gods | The fires atop Torch Hill have long been a boon to smiths and metalworkers, and your family is no exception. Whether you grew up in Torch or simply made several trips here with your parents to use the fire, this was to be your first time to use the torch for your own project. You managed to use the fires to craft a small weapon or piece of armor from skymetal, but not long thereafter the fires went out. The violet flames are as much a part of your upbringing as anything else, and their loss distresses you; you hope to find a way to rekindle the torch below the hill. You've long hoped to work with skymetal, and begin the game with a small metal bauble made of the skymetal of your choice-you made this item yourself. The item is nothing more than a valuable art object worth 100 gp. You can sell it to gain an additional 100 gp when creating your character, but if you keep it, your pride in its crafting grants you a +2 trait bonus on Will saving throws made against emotion and fear effects. You lose this bonus if you willingly sell or give up the item, but if it is destroyed or lost through no fault of your own, you retain a +1 trait bonus on such Will saves. |",
			"| [Sphinx Riddler](trait/sphinx_riddler) | Mummy's Mask | You've always been fascinated with the ancient race of sphinxes, and are inspired by them to love puzzles and riddles and enjoy solving difficult dilemmas. Like so many others, You've come to Wati to explore its ancient necropolis, but You've also heard that sphinxes occasionally visit a sphinx-shaped ruin called Ubet's Folly in the city-perhaps you'll have the chance to meet and talk with a sphinx yourself! You gain a +1 trait bonus on Bluff and Diplomacy checks against sphinxes, and a +1 trait bonus on any skill check to decipher a puzzle or riddle. In addition, you may choose Sphinx as one of your bonus languages. |",
			"| [Spirit Touched](trait/spirit_touched) | Return of the Runelords | As a child, you were influenced by overwhelming emotional trauma associated with death or undeath, and that influence marked you for the rest of your life. You may have been possessed by a ghost, had strange dreams in a haunted house, or suffered from an affliction from an undead source. You might even have had a near-death experience, or actually died and been returned to life. Work with your GM to determine the details of how you became spirit touched; she may have suggestions for you to tie your experience more tightly into the themes of the Return of the Runelords Adventure Path. |",
			"| [Star Struck](trait/star_struck) | Hell's Rebels | Growing up in Kintargo, it's hard not to become obsessed with one of the city's celebrities. There are so many to choose from, and they're all so glamorous, rich, and successful! Wouldn't it be amazing to, perhaps some day, meet one of them? Or even better, to be a Kintargan celebrity yourself? Your interest in one of Kintargo's celebrities could be completely benign, with the NPC acting as a muse, inspiration, or role model for you that you used to guide many life choices leading you to this day. Or perhaps your interest is more akin to an obsession, in which you hope to some day live a life like that you imagine your idol lives, or perhaps even to some day meet and become friends (or perhaps more than friends) with your idol. Keep in mind, though, that sometimes a celebrity's public persona and real personality are two very different things, and if some day you were to meet your idol, you might be surprised at the truth! That said, the fact that, by all accounts, your idol has been missing since House Thrune instituted martial law has you worried; you hope he or she is all right! The fact that all five of the local legends listed below have been rumored to have ties to the Silver Ravens further concerns you, considering how that group seems to have been particularly targeted by Barzillai Thrune's agents over the past week. The fate of all five of these Kintargan icons will be revealed at some point during the Hell's Rebels Adventure Path, but keep in mind that some of those fates might not be pleasant discoveries for you! |",
			"| [Stargazer (IG)](trait/stargazer_ig) | Iron Gods | They say the strange technological ruins scattered throughout Numeria came from the skies several thousand years ago. The concept of life on other planets far beyond Golarion has always fascinated you, and you've long hoped to learn more about what life on those other planets may have been like. you've heard stories about the strange alien creatures found in Numerian dungeons and hope to learn all you can about them-perhaps some of these aliens can be found in the caverns below Torch!

			"| [Stolen Fury](trait/stolen_fury) | Wrath of the Righteous | You were forced to take part in a demonic ritual as a youth after having been captured by cultists. Whatever the ritual's purpose may have been, it didn't work out the way your captors envisioned-rather than corrupting your soul, you absorbed the ritual's energy and made it your own before you escaped to safety. Ever since, you've been haunted by strange nightmares about the ritual, and have long felt that the energies it bathed you in have changed you. Recently, those energies have changed- it's as if you've finally managed to come to terms with your past and have turned the ritual's aftereffects to your advantage, following the old adage of what doesn't kill you makes you stronger. you've been unable to learn more about the ritual or what it was for, but the question lingers in the back of your head to this day. This nagging has instilled in you a fury against demonkind. Today, when you face demons in combat, those energies bolster your fury, granting you a +2 trait bonus on all combat maneuver checks against demons. |",
			"| [Stowaway](trait/stowaway) | Serpent's Skull | Not all passengers on seafaring vessels are legal or even known to the captain and crew, and the Jenivere is no exception. Whether too poor to book legal passage on the ship or fearing discovery by customs officials in your home port, you or an ally stowed away on the ship in secret. This may mean that the crew doesn't know you're on board, or perhaps they do now but didn't when the ship set sail. You gain a +1 trait bonus on Stealth checks and Survival checks to find food. |",
			"| [Student Survivalist](trait/student_survivalist) | Jade Regent | Although she is seen as something of a mystery to most of Sandpoint's citizens, Shalelu has never really seemed all that mysterious to you. Of course, that's probably because she helped raise you. You have never quite figured out why Shalelu decided to treat you as a younger sibling, but you certainly appreciated it- and you eagerly absorbed all of the survivalist tricks that she showed you over the years. As a result, you gain a +2 trait bonus on all Survival checks, and Survival is a class skill for you. In addition, you gain a +1 trait bonus on all attack rolls against foes that threaten your mentor. NPC Choices: Shalelu. |",

			"| [Subject of Study](trait/subject_of_study) | Carrion Crown | Professor Lorrimor approached you as part of his studies, as he had heard that you had survived a recent encounter with a strange monster or had another fateful encounter. Interested in the conditions of the runin and the means by which you avoided death or injury, he met with you and maintained frequent correspondence until several months ago. The scars of your experience and his continual reminders of the encounter prompted you to hone your skills lest you someday face the same type of creature again. The professor assisted you in this endeavor, providing you with insight into the anatomy and defenses of the creature that attacked you. |",
			"| [Sword Scion](trait/sword_scion) | Kingmaker | You have lived all your life in and around the city of Restov, growing up on tales of Baron Sirian Aldori and the exploits of your home city's heroic and legendary swordlords. Perhaps one of your family members was an Aldori swordlord, you have a contact among their members, or you have dreamed since childhood of joining. Regardless, you idolize the heroes, styles, and philosophies of the Aldori and have sought to mimic their vaunted art. Before you can petition to join their ranks, however, you feel that you must test your mettle. Joining an expedition into the Stolen Lands seems like a perfect way to improve your skills and begin a legend comparable to that of Baron Aldori. You begin play with a longsword or Aldori dueling sword and gain a +1 trait bonus on all attacks and combat maneuvers made with such weapons. |",
			"| [Taldan Patriot](trait/taldan_patriot) | War for the Crown | You love your country, its history, and its people... even though they may not love you back.

In addition, once per day you can recall a specific fact about a Taldan noble's personality-quirks such as a hobby or pet peeve- including information you would normally learn as a discovery check in social combat. |",
			"| [Teacher's Pet](trait/teacher's_pet) | Carrion Crown | Professor Lorrimor traveled the Inner Sea region lecturing and teaching at universities in locations as far-flung as Manaket and Magnimar, and as different in scope as the bardic colleges of Taldor and the battle colleges of the River Kingdoms. Speaking before standing-room-only lecture halls on topics as widely ranging as military strategy, planar anomalies, theology, and agriculture, Lorrimor's time was highly valued among those ambitious to benefit from his expertise. Despite this, he still managed to provide one-on-one assistance to the most promising of his acolytes. When he saw the potential for greatness in one of his charges, he took it upon himself to nurture their spark. You were such a student. Over the course of several months, you and the late professor spent hours debating the finer points of your topic of interest, and the intellectual doors he opened for you continue to flavor your outlook on the world. |",
			"| [The Artisan](trait/the_artisan) | Tyrant's Grasp | Precision is important in getting exactly what you want, and you give careful consideration in building everything from homes and vases to roads and empires. Your own attention to detail has proven vital in rebuilding Roslar's Coffer from the orc occupation a decade ago, whether you are an accountant, architect, engineer, or herbalist. Your attention to detail provides you a +1 trait bonus on Appraise and Heal checks, and one of these skills becomes a class skill for you. Once per day, you can spend a full round casting a spell you can cast that has a normal casting time of 1 standard action to increase your effective caster level for that spell by 1. This ability has no affect on spells with a casting time other than 1 standard action. |",
			"| [The Lawbringer](trait/the_lawbringer) | Tyrant's Grasp | The frontier is a land of risk and disorder, and while people are welcome to brave those elements themselves, they all too often bring pain down upon folk who never wanted such a risk. You might serve on the town guard or as part of a detachment of soldiers supported by Vigil, or you could be simply a concerned farmer who endures when others cannot, but your purpose is to stand as a bulwark against the cruel whims of fate for anyone who needs it. You gain a +2 trait bonus on saving throws against fear effects. If you have the aura of courage class feature, the bonus provided by your aura increases by 1. Your courage is inspiring; the first time each day you are knocked unconscious or killed, all allies within 30 feet of you immediately gain a number of temporary hit points equal to your level plus your Charisma modifier, as they rally to your defense. These temporary hit points last for 1 minute. |",
			"| [The Optimist](trait/the_optimist) | Tyrant's Grasp | People don't need to take your word that things are getting better; they only need to look around and see the proof before their eyes. The town's recovery from the orc occupation more than a decade ago is all but complete, and the monster in the Sarenite temple outside of town has finally been bested. Your irrepressible sense of optimism seems to fly in the face of the hard life that most residents of Roslar's Coffer face, but you're convinced that your positive attitude lifts up your community. You gain a +1 trait bonus on saving throws against mind-affecting effects. Further, your optimism can be infectious. As a swift action a number of times per day equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum 1), you can grant this bonus to an ally within 10 feet. This bonus lasts for 1 minute. |",
			"| [The Outsider](trait/the_outsider) | Tyrant's Grasp | You don't have a place, but the frontier seems comfortable enough for now. Maybe you're too informal for city life, too selfish for Lastwall's general culture of camaraderie, or too scarred by things you've seen to entirely trust another person. You are accustomed to moving without drawing much attention to yourself, gaining a +1 trait bonus on Stealth and Survival checks, and one of these skills is always a class skill for you. Accustomed to working alone, you gain only half the benefit (+1) from aid another actions, but you're accustomed to doing the job right the first time and so increase the bonus you provide by 1 when aiding another character. |",
			"| [The Pathfinder's Exile](trait/the_pathfinder's_exile) | Council of Thieves | Westcrown's dilapidated Pathfinder lodge of Delvehaven has long excited your imagination. Forcibly closed by the order of the city's diabolical rulers, the Pathfinders of Westcrown were exiled, forcing them to leave behind untold knowledge and the treasures of countless expeditions. Today, Delvehaven lies under the pale of fearful rumors and dark magic, and bureaucratic red tape has prevented trespass on the lodge's well-protected grounds. Having secretly and illegally contacted agents of the Pathfinders, you've expressed your interest in aiding their ventures in Cheliax-with a particular eye toward investigating Delvehaven, the source of your long-standing adventuresome interests. To your surprise, some days ago you received a message back from an unnamed Pathfinder operating underground in the country. Along with encouraging you to investigate the lodge and report your findings to the Grand Lodge in Absalom, he's sent along a battered and tarnished, yet still functional wayfinder. you've promised yourself to pay back your unknown contact the 500 gp cost of the item someday, but until then, it's yours to use. A wayfinder is a magical compass that grants you a +2 circumstance bonus on Survival checks to avoid becoming lost, and can be commanded to emit light as the spell (CL 5th) as a standard action. Further details on the Pathfinder Society and wayfinders can be found in the *Pathfinder Campaign Setting or Pathfinder Chronicles: Seekers of Secrets.* |",
			"| [The Pessimist](trait/the_pessimist) | Tyrant's Grasp | You expect the worst and have rarely been disappointed. Your dour outlook may hail from the original destruction of Roslar's Coffer at the hands of the Twisted Nail tribe, the exile of the faithful from the nearby Sarenite temple, or some more personal misfortune, but it has set you apart among the largely forward-thinking population of Lastwall. Your faith that the worst possible outcome will occur grants you a +1 trait bonus on Will saving throws. Your frustrating pessimism can spur friends to succeed just to spite you; once per day as a free action, you can force an ally within 30 feet to reroll a saving throw she just failed, using the better of the two results. |",
			"| [The Reclaimer](trait/the_reclaimer) | Tyrant's Grasp | You lost something precious in the destruction of Roslar's Coffer 12 years ago-a home, a legacy, perhaps even family-but returned because a soul shouldn't run from pain, but heal from it. Rebuilding your life and preventing that same hurt from dragging down others drives you to serve and protect, perhaps as a politician, charity worker, healer, or soldier, but that same loss fills you with an uncharitable anger that is often difficult to reconcile. Your wary eyes grant you a +1 trait bonus on Perception checks. You gain a +1 trait bonus on attack and damage rolls against any opponent that dealt hit point damage to one of your allies in the previous round. |",
			"| [The Snoop](trait/the_snoop) | Tyrant's Grasp | You know a little bit about most everything and everyone in Roslar's Coffer. It may be your profession, as you could be an archivist, crier, or librarian-or you simply make a hobby of gossip. Either way, you have a gift for recall and reading others. You gain a +1 trait bonus on Knowledge (history) and Knowledge (local) checks, and these both become class skills for you. Once each day you can reroll a single Bluff or Sense Motive check against a creature you have known for at least 24 hours, using the better result. |",
			"| [The Word](trait/the_word) | Tyrant's Grasp | In a nation overcrowded with faith, you often worry that your message is drowned out, but nonetheless important. The souls in Roslar's Coffer needed comfort and charity once upon a time, but have bounced back so fully-in part thanks to your hard work-that you worry you've made yourself unnecessary. You are accustomed to long hours, granting you a +1 trait bonus on Fortitude saving throws. Your faith is invigorating, and once per day you can lay on hands as a paladin of half your character level (minimum 1). If you gain the lay on hands ability from a class, you instead gain one additional use of lay on hands each day. |",
			"| [Thrill Seeker (RotR)](trait/thrill_seeker_rotr) | Rise of the Runelords | You've grown up in or around Sandpoint and are the heir to your family's modest farm, shop, or fishing boat, but You've always dreamed of more. Searching for a taste of excitement, You've come into town to participate in this year's Swallowtail festival. The thrill of danger grants you an additional +5 feet of movement during the first round of any combat. Additionally, you begin play with three star candle fireworks. |",
			"| [Thrune Informant](trait/thrune_informant) | Hell's Vengeance | The Thrice-Damned House of Thrune rules Cheliax with autocratic power, and its representatives can be found throughout the empire, drawn from all walks of life. Most of these agents do not work directly as government employees, but they still serve House Thrune in whatever ways they can. You are a true patriot of Cheliax, and have long worked for House Thrune as a paid informant. You report what you see to the authorities, and occasionally carry out specific tasks suited to your skill set and abilities when asked. People like you help prevent potential traitors and other \"undesirables\" from undermining Thrune's authority and keep Chelish society running smoothly. You hope that with continued faithful service, you will eventually be rewarded with greater authority and autonomy as a sworn agent of House Thrune. You gain a +1 trait bonus on Diplomacy checks to gather information, Disguise checks, and Knowledge (local) checks, and one of these skills (your choice) is a class skill for you. |",
			"| [Thrune Loyal Agent](trait/thrune_loyal_agent) | Hell's Vengeance; This is a special trait that can only be gained by progressing through the Hell's Vengeance Adventure Path. It is not available for normal character creation. | You have sworn your body to Queen Abrogail and House Thrune in a ritual ceremony, and are willing to lay down your life in service to Thrune. Once per week, when reduced to fewer than 0 hit points, you automatically gain fast healing 1 for 1 minute. Once this ability has been used, you instead gain a +4 trait bonus on Constitution checks to stabilize when reduced to negative hit points. |",
			"| [Time Lost](trait/time_lost) | Return of the Runelords | You've always felt separated from the era into which you were born. Perhaps you feel that you were born too late, and that you and your interests are better suited to a previous age. Maybe you have the conviction you were born too soon, and that your true destiny lies in some distant future. You might be suffering from missing time-whether a few hours, a few weeks, or even several months-for which you have no memories. You might instead receive brief visions of friends or enemies much older or younger than their actual age. You've long since grown used to this strange condition, but have not yet determined why you suffer from it. Your GM will be provided with additional information about this trait's strange nature in the third adventure of Return of the Runelords. |",
			"| [Touched by Divinity](trait/touched_by_divinity) | Wrath of the Righteous | As long as you can remember, you've had an unexplainable interest in one deity in particular. One of your parents may have been a priest of this deity, or you may have been an orphan raised by the church, but these alone cannot explain your deep connection to the faith. you've always felt calm and at ease in places holy to the deity, and often have dreams about the god or goddess visiting you-most often in the form of a sacred animal or creature. Your faith is strong, even if you don't happen to be a divine spellcaster-if you are a divine spellcaster, you should be a worshiper of this deity. You begin play with a silver holy symbol of your chosen deity for free. In addition, choose one domain associated with your chosen deity. You gain the use of that domain's 1st-level domain spell as a spell-like ability usable once per day (CL equals your character level). |",
			"| [Touched by the Sea](trait/touched_by_the_sea) | Skull and Shackles | You've always felt the call of the sea and your blood surges with the ebb and flow of the tides. Perhaps one of your parents was a sailor or pirate, or maybe one of your ancestors had a bit of aquatic elf or undine blood in them. Whatever the reason, you're as comfortable in the water as you are on land. You gain a +1 trait bonus on Swim checks and Swim is a class skill for you. In addition, penalties on attack rolls made underwater are lessened by 1. |",
			"| [Trap Finder](trait/trap_finder) | Mummy's Mask | Forgotten dungeons and ancient tombs have always held an appeal for you, and you've never been able to resist the urge to delve into these lost sites in search of knowledge, treasure, or both. You may not have received any formal training in the roguish arts, but you've nonetheless become skilled at spotting and disabling hidden traps. The tombs of Wati's necropolis, just opened for exploration, seem like the perfect place to put your skills to the test. You gain a +1 trait bonus on Disable Device checks, and that skill is always a class skill for you. In addition, you can use Disable Device to disarm magic traps, like a rogue. |",
			"| [True Devotion](trait/true_devotion) | Strange Aeons | You wake from your recent ordeal with a sense of shame, as if you had sinned deeply against your morals and beliefs. However, you feel a bit of relief as well, as if your god had granted you a second chance. You not only have a drive to figure out what happened to you, but an urge to fight back against the unspeakable forces of evil. If, during the course of your investigation, you discover that you took part in unsavory activities that would normally be opposed to your faith or alignment, this event no longer has any impact with your standing in the eyes of your god due to your renewed righteous convictions. |",
			"| [Trunau Native](trait/trunau_native) | Giantslayer | You were born and raised in the town of Trunau, one of the few human settlements in the orc-dominated Hold of Belkzen. Orc attacks are an ever-present threat, and like all Trunauans, you have made the Standing Vow: to hold Trunau against all attackers, orc or otherwise, to stand your ground, and to live free or die trying. Upon coming of age, you were given a hopeknife-a small, sheathed dagger, usually worn on a chain under your clothes-and taught how to use it to take your own life to avoid capture by orcs, or to grant the mercy of a quick death to the wounded. As a native, you have served in Trunau's militia, and fought alongside Patrol Captains Kurst and Rodrik Grath. You begin play with a hopeknife (a masterwork dagger), and your tenacity in the face of adversity grants you a +1 trait bonus on Will saves. |",
			"| [Twitchy](trait/twitchy) | Strange Aeons | Your first thought upon awaking in the asylum isn't confusion over why you can't remember anything clearly-it's a sudden urge to find safety. You feel like everything around you, aside from your companions, might threaten you and you're always ready to react. You have a hard time staying still, and you're constantly surveying your surroundings. Maybe you are paranoid, or maybe it's just an overactive imagination, but whatever it is, you know that keeping these feelings honed will help you stay alive. |",
			"| [Unbreakable Survivor](trait/unbreakable_survivor) | Ironfang Invasion | Over a decade ago, bandits took everything you valued in life and left you barely alive. You managed to rebuild your life in the years since, and your tenacity has made you a local legend. Once per day as a full round action, you may shrug off some of your injuries and immediately heal a number of hit points equal to your Constitution modifier + 1 per Hit Die. Your reputation for tenacity inspires your neighbors, and you gain a +1 trait bonus whenever you attempt to influence residents of Phaendar with Diplomacy or Intimidate checks. At 6th level, your reputation spreads further across the nation, and you may apply your trait bonus on Diplomacy and Intimidate checks to influence all humanoids in Nirmathas. |",
			"| [Undead Crusader](trait/undead_crusader) | Mummy's Mask | You have dedicated your life to eradicating the scourge of the undead from Golarion. You have spent countless hours studying the different types of undead and have trained endlessly to learn the best ways to defeat them. If any undead creatures come out of the tombs of Wati's necropolis, you'll be ready for them! You gain a +1 trait bonus on damage rolls against undead creatures. In addition, you gain a +1 trait bonus on Knowledge (religion) checks, and that skill is always a class skill for you. |",
			"| [Unhappy Childhood](trait/unhappy_childhood) | Curse of the Crimson Throne | You spent a period of time as one of Gaedren Lamm's enslaved orphans, doing all manner of dirty work for him. Maybe you were abducted from your parent's home or during a trip to the market. Perhaps the irresponsible matron who ruled your orphanage traded you to him in return for a desperately needed financial loan. Or perhaps you, like most of Gaedren's slaves, were merely a child of the street who succumbed to his promise of regular meals and a roof in return for what he said would be \"a little light work.\" Whatever the case, you spent several years of your life as one of \"Lamm's Lambs\" before escaping. You've nursed a grudge against the old man ever since. |",
			"| [Urban Sleuth](trait/urban_sleuth) | Hell's Rebels | Much of Kintargo's history is lost or hidden. You know because you've made a point of seeking out those secrets. Local urban legends and bits of strange historical rumors have long fascinated you-who knows what amazing truths about Kintargo's past have been lost forever to the redactors of House Thrune? What caused Professor Mangvhune of the Alabaster Academy to become the city's most infamous serial killer? Who were the dragons Adrakash, Ithanothaur, and Rivozair, and what were their ties to Kintargo? Why do the Devil's Bells of the Temple of Asmodeus seem to ring at random times, and is there a pattern to the peals? Who were the Silver Ravens who defended Kintargo during the Chelish Civil War, and why did they vanish so soon after that war's resolution? So many mysteries, and who better than you to find the answers? |",
			"| [Varisian Immunity](trait/varisian_immunity) | Curse of the Crimson Throne | Your family is particularly hearty, and has even passed down tales of a Varisian ancestor who sought to cure (or, some loose-lipped relatives say, create) diseases. You gain a +1 trait bonus on saving throws made to resist diseases. Additionally, you are immune to the diseases Vorel's phage and blood veil. You do not need to be of the Varisian ethnicity to take this campaign trait, but if you're not, your background should explain how you have a Varisian ancestor. |",
			"| [Vexing Defender](trait/vexing_defender) | Giantslayer | You're trained in fighting opponents that are larger than you, and you are skilled at keeping them on their toes, pestering them from all directions. You gain a +1 trait bonus on Acrobatics checks, and Acrobatics becomes a class skill for you. In addition, you gain a +4 trait bonus on Acrobatics checks to move through an enemy's space without provoking an attack of opportunity, provided that enemy is larger than you. |",
			"| [Vigilante Witch Hunter](trait/vigilante_witch_hunter) | Reign of Winter | You don't trust witches. They deal with otherworldly beings, consort with beasts, and brew vile poisons in their cauldrons. As a child, perhaps you barely escaped some horrid fate at the hands of an evil witch, or maybe a loved one was stolen from you by a witch's charms. Perhaps you wanted to be a witch yourself, but the local witch refused to take you on as an apprentice. Whatever the reason, you now hate witches, and have dedicated your life to ferreting them out and exposing their wickedness for all to see. You know that the North is full of winter witches, and should you ever find yourself there, you'll relish bringing your justice to them as well. You gain a +1 trait bonus on Sense Motive checks, and Sense Motive is a class skill for you. In addition, you begin the campaign with 1d4 hex nails (see the sidebar). |",
			"| [Warded against Witchery](trait/warded_against_witchery) | Reign of Winter | Sometime in your youth, you encountered a location, object, or being steeped in the power of evil witchcraft. Whether you were the victim of this force, were a conduit for it, or merely witnessed its effects, the event changed your life. You have tried to put the strange incident behind you and forget it, but nebulous premonitions of danger and eerie feelings of deja vu have dogged your steps ever since. For some inexplicable reason, you feel drawn to the lands of the North, though you fear another encounter with the evil witchcraft that touched you once before. Whether through your purity, the blessing of goodly spirits, an innate determination, or an intuitive and inexplicable familiarity with the ways of black magic, you have acquired a resilience against the power of the dark arts. You gain a +1 trait bonus on saving throws against the spells, spell-like abilities, and supernatural abilities of evil arcane spellcasters, and a +1 trait bonus on Spellcraft checks to identify spells cast by evil arcane spellcasters. |",
			"| [Wati Native](trait/wati_native) | Mummy's Mask | You were born and raised in the city of Wati, and you know its streets and secrets well. Although it's frowned upon by the city's authorities, you have sneaked into the necropolis on multiple occasions to wander its dusty, abandoned streets. Out of respect for the deceased, you've never actually entered one of the necropolis's silent tombs, but you have no fear of what might lie inside. You gain a +2 trait bonus on saves against fear effects. In addition, your knowledge of the city grants you a +1 trait bonus on Knowledge (local) checks, and that skill is always a class skill for you. |",
			"| [Westcrown Firebrand](trait/westcrown_firebrand) | Council of Thieves | There's something very wrong with the world. Spouses were not meant to huddle at their windows hoping and fearing day after day that their loved ones returned from work safely. Parents were not meant to hush their children when questioned about what happened to their neighbors. Citizens were not meant to avert their eyes and hurry by as guardsmen beat old friends in the street. The people of Westcrown have suffered long enough! It's time for a change. But how? You've heard rumors of bands of free-thinking individuals meeting after the citywide curfew. Perhaps they might share your ideals? You are quick to react to opportunity, both physically and mentally, and know that it is with sudden and swift action that many conflicts are best resolved. You gain a +1 trait bonus on Initiative checks, and if you act in a surprise round, you gain a +1 trait bonus on all attack rolls. |",
			"| [World-Weary](trait/world-weary) | Ironfang Invasion | You've seen the horrors of war, and had hoped you'd seen the end of it. You've retreated from the fighting-likely from the front line with Molthune, but maybe from the crusade of Lastwall or the political infighting of Ustalav-and now just want to protect and provide for those you care about. You gain one of the following as a permanent class skill: Appraise, Heal, Knowledge (history), Sense Motive, or Survival. When you perform an aid another action to improve a creature's Armor Class, you increase its AC by +4 rather than +2. |",
			"| [Young Reformer](trait/young_reformer) | War for the Crown | Perhaps you were born at the bottom of Taldan society and you're tired of seeing your friends and family toil endlessly with no hope of a better life, or maybe your privileged outlook was shattered by empathy or tragedy. Either way, you know the system is broken, and you've dedicated your life to fixing it. But tradition rules Taldor as much as any Grand Prince, and change requires more influence than you have- so far. you've got a few friends and allies, and plenty of determination, but while you work toward the power you need to change the nation, you'll have to resort to more discrete ways of righting wrongs and curbing the abuses of the upper class. You gain a +1 trait bonus on Disable Device and Knowledge (local) checks, and one of these skills is always a class skill for you. Once per day, you can call upon your coconspirators to have \"made arrangements\" on your behalf, allowing you to attempt a Knowledge (local) check in place of a single Bluff, Disable Device, Intimidate, or Sleight of Hand check. The DC of this Knowledge (local) check is equal to the DC of the skill check it replaces. Whatever arrangements you make-for doors left unlocked, guards strong-armed out of your way, stolen keys left for you to find-must be reasonable to have anticipated and achieved beforehand; you could arrange to have a noble convinced you're a very important diplomat traveling in disguise, for example, but if a fight breaks out you could not rely on your network of contacts to feint for you in combat. You don't have to use this ability in advance; you can announce its use as you encounter a challenge, implying you foresaw this challenge and made arrangements prior to your arrival. |",
			"| [Younger Sibling](trait/younger_sibling) | Jade Regent | You've lived your whole life in the shadow of your older sibling, a person who seems to have the adventure-filled lifestyle You've always wanted for yourself. While your sibling always took care of you, he or she never supported your desire to become an adventurer-your sibling never explained why, only saying, \"Adventuring can cause a lot of pain just as easily as it can bring success and riches.\" As a younger sibling to one of Sandpoint's more influential citizens, you share some of that NPC's innate talent and skill at adventuring. If you're Ameiko's younger sibling, your ferocious independence and self-confidence give you a +1 trait bonus on Will saving throws. If you're Sandru's younger sibling, your hearty constitution gives you a +1 trait bonus on all Fortitude saving throws. If you're Shalelu's younger sibling, your quick reflexes give you a +1 trait bonus on all Reflex saving throws. Note: Although you're a younger sibling of an established NPC, this doesn't necessarily lock you in to being the same race as that NPC-if you're a different race or ethnicity than the NPC you choose as your older sister or brother, you were adopted into the family by your parents. In addition, you gain a +1 trait bonus on all attack rolls against foes that threaten your older sibling. NPC Choices: Ameiko, Sandru, Shalelu. |"

			"| [Sentimental](trait/sentimental) |  | You are sentimental, and your thoughts often stray to the past at inappropriate times. You take a -2 penalty on Perception checks to avoid being surprised and on Reflex saving throws to avoid traps or hazards. |",
			"| [Shadow-Scarred](trait/shadow-scarred) |  | You were touched by terrible horrors that live in the darkness just outside the human sphere, such as shadow-beasts or aberrations linked to the Dark Tapestry, and feel your life-force ebb away ever so slightly whenever you return to the shadows. Whenever you are in an area of dim light or darkness, you take a -1 penalty on saving throws. |",
			"| [Sheltered](trait/sheltered) |  | Brought up in courtly environments and knowing little of violence, you have trouble getting accustomed to it. Whenever you have less than half your maximum hit points, you are shaken. |",
			"| [Sleepy](trait/sleepy) |  | You must sleep or rest for at least 12 hours each night to get the benefits of a full night's rest. You take a -2 penalty on saving throws against sleep effects. |",
			"| [Spooked](trait/spooked) |  | You had a traumatic experience with a spirit at a young age that colors your reactions to such creatures even to this day. Whenever you perceive a fey, outsider, or undead from within 60 feet, you become shaken for 1d4 rounds unless you succeed at a Will save with a DC equal to 15 + the creature's Charisma modifier. Immunity to fear effects does not allow you to forgo this saving throw; even if you are immune to fear, you must roll the Will saving throw for this drawback when applicable, albeit with a +4 bonus. |",
			"| [Stigmatized](trait/stigmatized) |  | You were kept at the periphery of society for a long period of time, so that even when you are among strangers in a new place, you feel the weight of your missing socialization. You take a -3 penalty on Diplomacy checks to gather information or improve a creature's attitude. |",
			"| [Superstitious (Drawback)](trait/superstitious_drawback) |  | Raised around those who regarded most magic as innately dangerous, no matter the source, you cannot bring yourself to submit to magic willingly even for your own good. Whenever you are affected with a harmless spell, there is a 50% chance that you must roll a saving throw to prevent that effect, even if it would benefit you. This does not apply to harmless spells cast by you upon yourself. |",
			"| [Tainted Spirit](trait/tainted_spirit) |  | When you were a child, a parent or other person with authority over you made a minor pact with a fiend on your behalf, stealing some of your vitality in exchange for a minor boon. At the end of any combat, you must attempt a Fortitude saving throw. The DC is 10 + the number of rounds you acted in combat. If you fail this save, you become fatigued for 10 minutes per round you acted during that encounter. |",
			"| [Too Many Secrets](trait/too_many_secrets) |  | You've told too many lies, and made up too many cover stories, and now even you can't keep it all straight. The lies have become reality to you, which makes it difficult to think of a new convincing lie. You hesitate at crucial moments when trying to fool those around you, and likely shouldn't be in the field at all anymore. You take a -2 penalty on Bluff checks and saving throws against illusions. |",
			"| [Umbral Unmasking](trait/umbral_unmasking) |  | You cast no shadow whatsoever, or the shadow you do have is monstrous. Under normal lighted conditions, this is not hard to observe-but uncommon to notice. Creatures that succeed at a DC 15 Wisdom check notice it plainly (an additional Perception check may be required based on environmental conditions). This telltale sign of wickedness cannot be concealed by misdirection, nondetection, or illusions, except those that also affect shadows (such as invisibility). |",
			"| [Unlearned](trait/unlearned) |  | You have always had difficulty learning and retaining information, and know very little about the world beyond the obvious and what pertains to your profession. Choose one Knowledge skill. You cannot attempt untrained Knowledge checks with any other Knowledge skills, even if the check's DC is 10 or lower. If you have access to a library that covers a specific Knowledge skill, you may attempt an untrained Knowledge check with a -2 penalty. |",
			"| [Vain](trait/vain) |  | You are sensitive about the way others perceive you. Whenever you fail an opposed Charisma-based check, you take a -2 penalty on all Charisma-based checks for the next 24 hours. |",
			"| [Vainglory](trait/vainglory) |  | You compulsively seek recognition for your deeds, making it hard to act with subtlety. You take a -1 penalty on Bluff, Disguise, and Stealth checks, and the save DC of any illusion you create is 1 lower than normal. |",
			"| [Warded Against Nature](trait/warded_against_nature) |  | Animals do not willingly approach within 30 feet of you, unless you or the animal's master succeeds at a DC 20 Handle Animal, Ride, or wild empathy check. Animal companions, familiars, and mounts granted by your class abilities are immune to this effect. |",
			"| [Xenophobic](trait/xenophobic) |  | You have a hard time understanding and trusting those with unfamiliar ways and appearances. You take a -2 penalty on Diplomacy and Sense Motive checks made against creatures of a different race or from a different culture. |",
			"| [Zealous (Drawback)](trait/zealous_drawback) |  | You are fanatical in your beliefs, ruled by emotion over reason. When you attack a creature that you know worships a different religion than you do, you take a -5 penalty on the attack roll and a +2 trait bonus on the damage roll with your first attack. |"

			"| Trait | Requirements | Description |",
			"| --- | --- | --- |",
			"| [Augmented Disguise](trait/augmented_disguise) |  | You are especially good at disguising yourself when you have props available. |",
			"| [Dealmaker](trait/dealmaker) |  | You have the air of a person with money, allowing you to buy and sell valuables that otherwise are too rich for the local community. Once per week, when looking for an item with a price greater than the local community's base value (see page 461 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook), make a DC 10 Diplomacy check; add 10 to the DC for each community size category between the current community and the community size with a base value sufficient for that item. Success means (with GM approval) you're able to sell or purchase that item as if the local community were of sufficient size. Each additional attempt (successful or otherwise) in that community increases the DC by an additional +10. Example: If you're trying to find a +1 cloak of resistance (1,000 gp), you'd normally need to be in a small town (base value 1,000 gp) or larger to be able to find that item with little trouble. If you're currently in a hamlet, that's two community sizes away from a small town, so the Diplomacy DC is 30. If you went to a village and asked there, the DC would only be 20 because it's only one community size away from a small town. |",
			"| [Extremely Fashionable](trait/extremely_fashionable) |  | You really know how to make a good impression when you're dressed well. Whenever you are wearing clothing and/or jewelry worth at least 150 gp (and not otherwise covered in gore, sewage, or other things that mar your overall look), you gain a +1 trait bonus on Bluff, Diplomacy, and Intimidate checks. One of these skills (your choice) is a class skill for you. |",
			"| [Heirloom Weapon](trait/heirloom_weapon) |  | You carry a non-masterwork simple or martial weapon that has been passed down from generation to generation in your family (pay the standard gp cost for the weapon). When you select this trait, choose one of the following benefits: proficiency with that specific weapon, a +1 trait bonus on attacks of opportunity with that specific weapon, or a +2 trait bonus on one kind of combat maneuver when using that specific weapon. |",
			"| [Improvisational Equipment](trait/improvisational_equipment) |  | You have an uncanny knack for turning equipment to new and unexpected uses. When using an item for anything other than its intended purpose-such as using a crowbar as a grappling hook or an old shirt to bandage a deadly wound-reduce the improvisation penalty by 2. This does not apply to improvised weapon penalties. Your GM may rule that some things are just not suitable for use in certain ways; for example, gluing a dead orc's face to your own face won't help you disguise yourself as an orc. |",
			"| [Iron Liver](trait/iron_liver) |  | Due to a lucky constitution or frequent exposure, your body is resistant to poison, including alcohol and drugs. You gain a +2 trait bonus on Fortitude saves against poison and drugs, and a +4 trait bonus on Fortitude saves to avoid the effects of alcohol. |",
			"| [Power of Suggestion](trait/power_of_suggestion) |  | People trust your words over their own eyes. You may make a Bluff check to make observers believe that an object in your possession is actually a different object entirely. The DC for the check is 20 for items of a similar size, shape, and color (such as a glaive and a quarterstaff). Items of a different shape, size, or color raise the DC by 5 for each dissimilar aspect, or more if the dissimilarity is extreme. This deception lasts 1 minute; if the item is still in view, the observers may recognize their error unless you make another bluff check. |",
			"| [Prehensile Whip](trait/prehensile_whip) |  | In your hand a whip has a life of its own, wrapping around pillars and beams with ease. You can use a whip as if it were a rope with a grappling hook at the end. Attaching your whip is a standard action, but detaching it is a full-round action. |",
			"| [Quick Learner](trait/quick_learner) |  | You're skilled at learning the feel of a particular weapon after a few swings in combat. After your first attack with a weapon in which you are not proficient, the non-proficiency penalty decreases by 2 (to a -2 penalty). This effect lasts only while you have the weapon in hand; you must \"relearn\" the weapon each time you pick it up. |",
			"| [Rough and Ready](trait/rough_and_ready) |  | Your intense familiarity with the tools of your trade allows you to use them in combat as if they were actual weapons and makes them more effective for that purpose than they would normally be. When you use a tool of your trade (requiring at least 1 rank in the appropriate Craft or Profession skill) as a weapon, you do not take the improvised weapon penalty and instead receive a +1 trait bonus on your attack. This trait is commonly used with shovels, picks, blacksmith hammers, and other sturdy tools-lutes and brooms make terribly fragile weapons. |",
			"| [Stage Magic](trait/stage_magic) |  | You have put in many hours practicing with flashy alchemical items that enhance your Perform skill. When you use an attention-getting alchemical item such as a flask of alchemist's fire, smokestick, thunderstone, or another appropriate alchemical item (GM's discretion) as part of a performance, you gain a +2 trait bonus on your Perform check for the duration of that performance. The item is expended without its normal effects and only serves to make your performance more impressive; for example, you could pretend to ignite yourself with alchemist's fire as part of a Perform (comedy) check or make a dramatic appearance with a smokestick as part of a Perform (act) check, but you would not actually take fire damage or gain concealment from smoke. |",
			"| [Stealthy Escape](trait/stealthy_escape) |  | You are adept at escaping from confinement in an unobtrusive manner. When trying to escape manacles, rope, or other similar restraints (but not grapples or similar attacks), you may make a Sleight of Hand check instead of your Escape Artist modifier. If you free yourself, you gain a +2 trait bonus on Bluff checks to pretend that you are still bound. |",
			"| [Thrown-Together Fashion](trait/thrown-together_fashion) |  | You can modify old clothing to make it effective in new circumstances. With a basic sewing kit or disguise kit, you can make a Disguise check to change one outfit into another outfit (see page 159 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook, or page 13 of this book). The DC of this check is equal to 10 + the gp difference between costs of the outfits. The alteration takes 10 minutes per 1-gp difference in the cost of the outfits. |",
			"| [Well-Provisioned Adventurer](trait/well-provisioned_adventurer) |  | You always knew that one day you would leave your humble beginnings behind and become an adventurer, so you scrimped and saved, buying the necessary equipment one piece at a time until you had everything you needed. Select one of the equipment packages below. If you select this trait during character creation, you do not receive any starting gold. |"

Once per day when you are within 60 feet of another character with this family trait who shares the race, template, or bloodline, you can use the selected ability without it counting against your normal daily limit. |",
			"| [Family Resemblance](trait/family_resemblance) |  | You have some of the common, recognizable features of your family. You gain a +4 trait bonus on Diplomacy checks made to improve the attitude of a creature that has a friendly or helpful attitude toward another member of your family, and a +2 bonus on Disguise checks to look like a specific member of your family. You also take a -2 penalty on Disguise checks to look like anyone who is not a member of your family. |",
			"| [Family Trade](trait/family_trade) |  | Choose one skill. All family members with this trait must choose the same skill and it is always a class skill for you. When you are within 60 feet of a family member with this trait, you gain a +2 trait bonus on checks with this skill. |",
			"| [Honor-Bound](trait/honor-bound) |  | The family's honor is tied to a shared goal binding you all together. With the aid of the GM, choose a task that your family is bound to accomplish. Once per day, when you are within 60 feet of another character with this trait, you can gain a +1 trait bonus on a single saving throw or skill check when progress toward the goal is directly at stake (at the GM's discretion). |",
			"| [Rivalry](trait/rivalry) |  | If you see a family member with this trait within 60 feet of you fail a combat maneuver check or a skill check, you gain a +1 trait bonus on checks to perform the same combat maneuver or use the same skill for 1 round. |",
			"| [Tight Bonds](trait/tight_bonds) |  | Whether siblings, spouses, or dedicated members of the same clan, characters who take this trait are an inseparable pair committed to each other. Your partner or partners must also have this trait. You gain a +1 trait bonus on Will saves against charm and compulsion effects if a partner is within 60 feet, increasing to +3 against a command to compromise your relationship or harm a partner. |"

			"| [Clever Mount](trait/clever_mount) | Have a mount | This mount can learn four tricks per point of Intelligence, instead of the typical three. Commanding the mount with the Handle an Animal use of the Handle Animal skill requires a successful DC 15 skill check instead of the usual DC 10, however, as it is willful and easily bored. |",
			"| [Cunning Breed](trait/cunning_breed) | Have a Taldor jennet as a mount | A Taldor jennet can learn a total of eight tricks when trained using the Handle Animal skill (as opposed to the standard six for having an Intelligence score of 2). |",
