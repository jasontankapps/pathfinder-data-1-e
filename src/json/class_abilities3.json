			"While all paladins have their own codes of conduct, either taught by an order, handed down from the gods, or inspired by personal conviction, an oathbound paladin devotes herself to a singular cause, which grants her additional powers but also gives further edicts she must follow. An oathbound paladin swears an oath to eradicate a certain kind of evil. This powerful oath gives her access to new spells and adds to or alters typical paladin abilities.",
			"",
			"An oathbound paladin can take multiple oaths, but none of the other oaths can replace or alter the same class feature from the paladin class as another alternate class feature. For example, a paladin cannot take the Oath against Corruption and the Oath against the Wyrm because they both replace the aura of courage class feature.",
			"",
			"Paladins who take up an oath may make a sacred promise to their god or temple to perform some specific and grand action associated with the oath. For example, an oathbound paladin who takes the Oath of Vengeance may be tasked with killing the orc warlord who razed her home city, while a paladin with the Oath against the Wyrm may be asked to secure a non-aggression pact with a family of dragons. When a paladin completes the sacred promise, the oath is fulfilled, and she may abandon the oath if she so chooses; she may then select another oath or become a standard paladin or a different paladin archetype.",
			"",
			"If a paladin violates the code of her oath, she loses the class abilities associated with that oath until she atones. If she violates her paladin's code, she loses her oath abilities as well as her other paladin abilities.",
			"",
			"An oathbound paladin has the following class features.",
			"",
			"**Deity:** Some oaths are especially compatible with the faiths of certain deities; these deities are listed here. Other deities may allow these oaths as well, though only rarely do deities allow oaths conflicting with their teachings.",
			"",
			"**Code of Conduct:** The oathbound paladin must abide by the listed tenets of her oath in addition to the specifics of her god's code of conduct. In some cases, a deity's or paladin order's code may conflict with the oath's tenets; in most cases, these conflicts mean the oath is unsuitable for a paladin of that deity or order (such as the Oath against the Wyrm with respect to a good dragon deity or a dragon-riding order of paladins) and cannot be selected by the paladin.",
			"",
			"**Oath Spells:** A paladin's oath influences what magic she can perform. An oathbound paladin adds one spell to the paladin spell list at each paladin spell level she can cast (including spell levels for which she would only gain spells per day if her Charisma were high enough to grant bonus spells of that level). Her oath determines what spell is added to the spell list. If the paladin has multiple oaths, the spells from each oath are added to her spell list.",
			"",
			"If an oathbound paladin has more than one oath, she may prepare any one of her oath's spells in that slot (similar to a cleric choosing one of her two domain spells to prepare in a domain spell slot).",

			"At 1st level, a cavalier must pledge himself to a specific order. The order grants the cavalier a number of bonuses, class skills, and special abilities. In addition, each order includes a number of edicts that the cavalier must follow. If he violates any of these edicts, he loses the benefits from his order's challenge ability for 24 hours. The violation of an edict is subject to GM interpretation.",
			"",

Note that the names of these orders might vary depending upon the campaign setting or GM's preference.",

			"A psychic develops particular techniques to empower her spellcasting, called phrenic amplifications. The psychic can activate a phrenic amplification only while casting a spell using psychic magic, and the amplification modifies either the spell's effects or the process of casting it. The spell being cast is called the linked spell. The psychic can activate only one amplification each time she casts a spell, and doing so is part of the action used to cast the spell. She can use any amplification she knows with any psychic spell, unless the amplification's description states that it can be linked only to certain types of spells. A psychic learns one phrenic amplification at 1st level, selected from the list below. At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, the psychic learns a new phrenic amplification. A phrenic amplification can't be selected more than once. Once a phrenic amplification has been selected, it can't be changed. Phrenic amplifications require the psychic to expend 1 or more points from her phrenic pool to function.",
			"",
			"---",
			"",
			"**Biokinetic Healing (Su)** ([Occult Origins pg. 16](source/occult_origins)): When the psychic casts a linked spell from the transmutation school, she can spend 1 point from her phrenic pool to regain 2 hit points per level of the linked spell.",
			"",
			"**Complex Countermeasures (Ex)** ([Occult Adventures pg. 60](source/occult_adventures)): The psychic can spend 1 point from her phrenic pool to increase by 2 the DCs of concentration checks or caster level checks the linked spell requires enemies to attempt. For example, if the linked spell were {spell/nondetection}, the DC of the caster level check for using a divination on the warded creature or item would increase. This increase also applies to checks to dispel, counterspell, or identify the linked spell. The bonus applies while the spell is cast and lasts for the spell's duration (if appropriate), to a maximum of 24 hours. The psychic can choose to spend 2 points from her phrenic pool to instead increase the linked spell's DCs by 4.",
			"",
			"**Conjured Armor (Su)** ([Occult Adventures pg. 61](source/occult_adventures)): By spending 1 point from her phrenic pool, the psychic grants any creature she conjures or summons with the linked spell a +2 deflection bonus to AC. This bonus lasts for 1 round per caster level or until the creature disappears, whichever comes first. This amplification can be linked only to conjuration (calling) or conjuration (summoning) spells. The bonus increases to +3 at 8th level and to +4 at 15th level.",
			"",
			"**Defensive Prognostication (Su)** ([Occult Adventures pg. 61](source/occult_adventures)): When casting a divination spell, the psychic sees a glimmer of her future. By spending 1 point from her phrenic pool as she casts a divination spell, she gains a +2 insight bonus to AC for a number of rounds equal to the linked spell's level. She can instead spend 2 points to increase the bonus to +4. This amplification can be linked only to divination spells.",
			"",
			"**Dragon's Breath (Su)** ([Occult Origins pg. 16](source/occult_origins)): The psychic can spend 2 points from her phrenic pool to change a linked spell that has a line or burst area of effect into a 30-foot cone that emanates from the psychic's mouth as a breath weapon.",
			"",
			"**Focused Force (Su)** ([Occult Adventures pg. 61](source/occult_adventures)): When casting a force spell, the psychic can increase the spell's damage by spending 1 point from her phrenic pool. Increase the die size for the spell's damage by one step (from 1d4 to 1d6, 1d6 to 1d8, 1d8 to 1d10, or 1d10 to 1d12). This increases the size of each die rolled, so a spell that dealt 4d6+3 points of force damage would deal 4d8+3 points of force damage instead. This amplification can be linked only to spells that deal force damage, and only if that damage includes a die value. A spell that already uses d12s for damage can't be amplified in this way.",
			"",
			"**Intense Focus (Ex)** ([Occult Adventures pg. 61](source/occult_adventures)): The psychic can spend 1 point from her phrenic pool to gain a +2 bonus on any concentration check she attempts as part of casting the linked spell. She can choose to spend 2 points from her phrenic pool to instead gain a +4 bonus.",
			"",
			"**Mind's Eye (Su)** ([Heroes of Golarion pg. 13](source/heroes_of_golarion)): Some psychics train their visual and psychic senses, binding them together into a unified focus to better guide their ranged spells and place them with uncanny precision. While casting a spell that requires a ranged attack roll, the psychic can spend 2 points from her phrenic pool and gain a +4 insight bonus on the attack roll. The psychic can spend 1 additional point to ignore penalties from cover (but not total cover).",
			"",
			"**Mindshield (Su)** ([Occult Adventures pg. 61](source/occult_adventures)): The psychic can spend 1 point from her phrenic pool to give one target of the linked spell a +2 morale bonus on Will saves for 1 round per psychic level (maximum 10 rounds). The psychic can instead spend 2 points to increase the bonus to +4. If the linked spell affects more than one creature, the psychic can spend the same number of points for each additional creature she wants to affect with this amplification. She must choose to spend either 1 point for each creature or 2 points for each creature; she can't grant different bonuses to different targets.",
			"",
			"**Mindtouch (Su)** ([Occult Adventures pg. 61](source/occult_adventures)): The psychic can spend 1 point from her phrenic pool to probe one target's mind if that creature is affected by the linked spell. If the target of the linked spell fails its saving throw or is hit by the spell, the psychic detects its surface thoughts (as the 3rd-round effect of {spell/detect thoughts}). If the linked spell doesn't already require an attack roll or allow a saving throw, the target can attempt a Will saving throw to avoid the thought-detection effect only; the DC is calculated using the linked spell's level (and all other bonuses that would apply if the linked spell allowed a Will save). This amplification can be linked only to spells that affect a target or an area. If the linked spell can affect more than one creature, the psychic can attempt to detect more than one target's thoughts by spending 1 additional point per creature beyond the first. She must select these targets when she casts the spell and spends the points. This is a mind-affecting effect.",
			"",
			"**Ongoing Defense (Su)** ([Occult Adventures pg. 61](source/occult_adventures)): The psychic can increase the duration of spells that improve her psychic defenses. She can spend 1 point from her phrenic pool when she casts any [intellect fortress](spell/intellect_fortress_1), [mental barrier](spell/mental_barrier_1), [thought shield](spell/thought_shield_1), or [tower of iron will](spell/tower_of_iron_will_1) spell to extend the spell's duration by 1 round.",
			"",
			"**Overpowering Mind (Ex)** ([Occult Adventures pg. 62](source/occult_adventures)): The psychic can spend 2 points from her phrenic pool to increase the Will save DC of the linked spell by 1. At 8th level, she can choose to instead spend 4 points to increase the DC by 2. At 15th level, she can choose to instead spend 6 points to increase the DC by 3. This amplification can be linked only to spells that have the mind-affecting descriptor and require a Will saving throw.",
			"",
			"**Perfect Body (Ex)** ([Heroes of Golarion pg. 13](source/heroes_of_golarion)): Some practitioners of psychic techniques extend their training to improve their bodies as well as their minds. When the psychic casts a linked transmutation spell, she can spend 1 point from her phrenic pool to gain a +2 bonus on her next Reflex or Fortitude save.",
			"",
			"**Phrenic Strike (Su)** ([Occult Origins pg. 16](source/occult_origins)): As long as the psychic has at least 1 point in her phrenic pool, she can attempt an unarmed strike in place of a touch attack as part of casting a spell with a range of touch. This unarmed attack still provokes attacks of opportunity as normal unless the psychic can otherwise make unarmed attacks without provoking attacks of opportunity.",
			"",
			"**Psychic Defense (Su)** ([Heroes of Golarion pg. 13](source/heroes_of_golarion)): Reading small, invisible cues allows the psychic to take advantage of social circumstances and subtly influence her target. Casting a linked spell during a social encounter and spending 1 point from her phrenic pool allows the psychic to add a +4 bonus on her next Bluff, Diplomacy, Intimidate, or Sense Motive check.",
			"",
			"**Psychofeedback (Su)** ([Occult Origins pg. 16](source/occult_origins)): The psychic can spend 2 points from her phrenic pool to sacrifice a linked spell of 2nd level or higher. Doing so grants the psychic a +1 enhancement bonus to Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution per level of the sacrificed spell. This bonus lasts for 1 minute per psychic level.",
			"",
			"**Relentless Casting (Su)** ([Occult Adventures pg. 62](source/occult_adventures)): The psychic can spend 1 point from her phrenic pool to roll twice on any caster level checks to overcome spell resistance required for the linked spell and take the better result. Because she must decide to spend points from her phrenic pool when she starts casting a spell, the psychic must decide to use this ability before the GM calls for the caster level check.",
			"",
			"**Telempathic Restoration (Su)** ([Occult Origins pg. 16](source/occult_origins)): When the psychic casts {spell/telepathic bond}, she can spend 1 point from her phrenic pool to remove the dazed, frightened, panicked, shaken, or stunned condition from one target of the bond. Doing so removes the status from the target of the linked spell, but applies it immediately (with any remaining duration) to the psychic.",
			"",
			"**Transfer Fear (Su)** ([Occult Origins pg. 16](source/occult_origins)): When the psychic successfully affects a target with a fear effect, she can spend 1 point from her phrenic pool to remove a fear effect from herself or one ally with whom she is in telepathic contact.",
			"",
			"**Undercast Surge (Su)** ([Occult Adventures pg. 62](source/occult_adventures)): When the psychic undercasts a spell, she can spend points from her phrenic pool to increase the spell's effective level, essentially using up a lower-level spell slot to cast a higher-level version of the spell. This costs 2 points per spell level increased. She can't use this ability to cast a version higher than the version she knows. For instance, a psychic who knows [mind thrust III](spell/mind_thrust_3) but not [mind thrust IV](spell/mind_thrust_4) could cast [mind thrust II](spell/mind_thrust_2) and spend 2 points to treat it as [mind thrust III](spell/mind_thrust_3), but couldn't spend 4 points to treat it as [mind thrust IV](spell/mind_thrust_4). This amplification can be linked only to spells that can be undercast.",
			"",
			"**Whisper of Ancients (Ex)** ([Heroes of Golarion pg. 13](source/heroes_of_golarion)): The psychic can send her consciousness into the Astral Plane for a glimpse of synchronous information. While casting a linked divination spell, the psychic can spend 1 point from her phrenic pool to gain a +2 bonus on any associated skill check. She can spend 2 points from her phrenic pool to instead gain a +4 bonus.",
			"",
			"**Will of the Dead (Su)** ([Occult Adventures pg. 62](source/occult_adventures)): Even undead creatures can be affected by the psychic's mind-affecting spells. The psychic can spend 2 points from her phrenic pool to overcome an undead creature's immunity to mind-affecting effects for the purposes of the linked spell. This ability functions even on mindless undead, but has no effect on creatures that aren't undead. This amplification can be linked only to spells that have the mind-affecting descriptor."

			"**Artificial Ascension** ([Occult Realms pg. 12](source/occult_realms)): You can upload your consciousness into a robot, becoming an artificial intelligence. Performing this ascension requires uninterrupted access to a construct with the robot subtype and at least 10 Hit Dice for 24 hours, during which time you cannot perform other tasks. Any interruptions cause the upload to fail. At the end of the 24 hours your consciousness is successfully uploaded into the robot. If the robot is not willing, it must attempt a Will save (DC = 1/2 your psychic level + your Intelligence modifier). If it is successful, the robot rejects your consciousness, rendering you staggered for 24 hours and unable to perform the ritual again during this time.",

Your creature type changes to artificial intelligence, and your robot body gains the aggregate template, with all the adjustments made in the template's description.",

If the robot is not willing to serve as your vessel, it receives a Will save as above, except if it succeeds, your current robot body is staggered for only 1 minute. If it fails, you move from your current body to the new host body, granting it the aggregate template. Your previous robot body is immediately destroyed by the transference.",

You can cast diagnose disease as a spell-like ability at will. Additionally, you can touch a creature afflicted with a disease as a standard action and draw the disease into yourself, or transfer it to another willing living creature that is susceptible to diseases and that you (or the afflicted creature) are also touching. Attempt a caster level check against a DC equal to 10 + the disease's Fortitude save DC. If you are successful, the afflicted creature is no longer affected by the disease. If you move the disease into yourself or another creature you (or the afflicted) are touching, the target receiving the disease must immediately attempt a Fortitude save as if it were initially exposed to the disease. If the target fails, the disease affects it immediately with no onset time. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Intelligence modifier. You must be at least 7th level to select this discovery.",

If you spend 2 points from your phrenic pool, the force field provides a number of temporary hit points equal to 10 + your psychic level (maximum 20 temporary hit points). The force field lasts for a number of minutes equal to your psychic level. If you spend 3 points from your phrenic pool, the force field lasts for twice as long, and it provides fast healing 2. Once the temporary hit points are depleted, the force field disappears and you cannot reinstate it for 24 hours. You must be at least 3rd level to select this discovery.",

As a standard action, you can sacrifice an unused spell slot of 1st level or higher and transform it into a ray of laser energy, targeting any foe within 30 feet as a ranged touch attack. This attack deals 2d6 points of fire damage plus an additional 1d6 points of fire damage for every level of the spell slot you sacrificed. You can't sacrifice 0-level spells in this manner.

She gains another rage power for every two levels of barbarian attained after 2nd level. A barbarian gains the benefits of rage powers only while raging, and some of these powers require the barbarian to take an action first. Unless otherwise noted, a barbarian cannot select an individual power more than once.",

This cannot be a rage power that requires the creature to spend a standard action or rounds of rage to activate it. For example, the skald cannot choose *terrifying howl* (which requires a standard action to activate), but can choose knockback (which is made in place of a melee attack).",

			"**Elemental** rage powers can be selected by any barbarian or skald who is at least 6th level and has the elemental stance, lesser elemental rage, or lesser elemental blood rage power. A barbarian or skald can use only one of these rage powers at a time, and an unchained barbarian must adopt the elemental stance to do so.",

			"## Ranger Traps",
			"",
			"Rangers are legendary for their ability to hunt down and capture their prey. Some rangers can create elaborate traps out of scraps, vines, and perhaps a little bit of specialized magic. Characters can learn how to set these traps by taking the {feat/Learn Ranger Trap} feat or by having the {archetype-ranger/trapper} ranger archetype.",
			"",
			"Setting a trap is a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity. A trap fills a single 5-foot square, and cannot be placed in the same area as another ranger trap or a magical trap such as a glyph of warding. The ranger only needs simple materials to create the trap, such as a piece of cloth, a small amount of metal (such as a dagger, iron spike, or a few nails), a foot of rope or vine, and so on. The DCs for Perception checks to notice the trap, Disable Device checks to disable it, and for saving throws to avoid it are equal to 10 + 1/2 the character's level + the character's Wisdom bonus. All ranger traps are Trigger: location, and Reset: none.",
			"",
			"Ranger traps are either extraordinary or supernatural; extraordinary traps are Type: mechanical, and supernatural traps are Type: magic.",
			"",
			"Some of the traps listed below may be set as extraordinary traps or as magical (supernatural) traps; learning such a trap lets a ranger set it either way. An extraordinary trap has a -2 penalty to its DC. An extraordinary trap lasts 1 day per ranger level or until it is triggered, whichever comes first. A magical trap lasts only 1 hour per level or until triggered, whichever comes first. A trap's DC decreases by 1 for each full day (or hour, for a magical trap) that passes after it is set.",
			"",
			"Certain traps add to or modify the effects of another trap; a ranger can add one of these trap types to any standard ranger trap (this costs 1 additional use of the trap ability).",
			"",
			"Some supernatural traps can be created by a character who isn't a ranger (but who has the {feat/Learn Ranger Trap} feat) through including an additional magical component. This component - usually a scroll, potion, or oil - is expended at the time of the trap's creation. Including it increases the time to lay the trap to 1 full minute.",
			"",
			"### Acid Trap (Ex or Su)",
			"",
			"{SOURCE Kobolds of Golarion}",
			"",
			"**Effect:** The target is splattered with acid, taking a number of points of acid damage equal to 1d6 + 1/2 the ranger's level to the triggering creature (Reflex negates). If it is an extraordinary trap, the ranger must supply a dose of acid when setting the trap.",
			"",
			"**Magical Component:** *scroll of {spell/corrosive touch}*",
			"",
			"### Alarm Trap (Ex or Su)",
			"",
			"{SOURCE Ultimate Magic}",
			"",
			"**Effect:** When the trap is triggered, it also creates a momentary loud noise equivalent to the audible alarm version of {spell/alarm}.",
			"",
			"### Anchoring Trap (Su)",
			"",
			"{SOURCE Demon Hunter's Handbook}",
			"",
			"**Effect:** This trap can be added to a supernatural *snare trap*. The trap briefly imprisons any called creature (such as those called by the {spell/planar binding} spells) for 1d4 rounds (Will negates). During this time the creature may not move from the location of the trap, though it may still use ranged effects and attack any creature within its reach. Additionally, anchoring traps disable the creature's ability to travel within or between dimensions. This includes casting {spell/astral projection}, {spell/blink}, {spell/dimension door}, {spell/ethereal jaunt}, {spell/etherealness}, {spell/gate}, {spell/maze}, {spell/plane shift}, {spell/shadow walk}, {spell/teleport}, {spell/teleportation circle}, and similar spell-like abilities. The trap does not prevent the creature from using magic items that produce these effects, like [cubic gates](magic-wondrous/cubic_gate), [helms of teleportation](magic-wondrous/helm_of_teleportation), or [amulets of the planes](magic-wondrous/amulet_of_the_planes). The trap can hold up to a Medium creature; each extra daily use of the ranger's trap ability spent when the trap is set increases the maximum size of creature the trap can hold by one size category.",
			"",
			"### Blightburn Trap (Ex)",
			"",
			"{SOURCE Kobolds of Golarion}",
			"",
			"**Effect:** This trap strikes the target with a small shard of {equipment-material/blightburn}, dealing 2d6 points of fire damage, 1d3 points of Constitution damage, and 1d3 points of Charisma damage. A successful Fortitude save negates the ability damage and halves the fire damage. The ranger must supply a sliver of blightburn, a dangerous task in itself, though storing the blightburn in a lead vial makes the task less risky.",
			"",
			"### Blighted Mark Trap (Ex or Su)",
			"",
			"{SOURCE People of the Wastes}",
			"",
			"**Effect:** Effect This trap stains the victim with blighted plant matter, increasing its susceptibility to the attacks of creatures created or enthralled by the affliction. The target takes a -2 penalty to Armor Class against the attacks of creatures closely affiliated with the specific blight (typically demons, fey, plants, or undead) and on saving throws against effects created by such creatures. This effect lasts for 10 minutes per ranger level. A successful Will save negates this effect. Regardless of whether this is a extraordinary or supernatural trap, the ranger must supply a sample of the specific blight when setting this trap.",
			"",
			"### Bludgeoning Trap (Ex or Su)",
			"",
			"{SOURCE Ranged Tactics Toolbox}",
			"",
			"**Effect:** The trap bludgeons the creature that triggers it. The trap makes an attack with a bonus equal to the ranger's character level + his Wisdom bonus. The triggering creature is denied its Dexterity bonus to AC if it was unaware of the trap. If the trap hits, it deals 1d6 points of bludgeoning damage for every 4 levels the ranger possesses (minimum 1d6). If it's an extraordinary trap, the ranger must provide an object suitable for dealing lethal bludgeoning damage, such as a large branch or heavy stone.",
			"",
			"### Burning Trap (Ex or Su)",
			"",
			"{SOURCE Ultimate Magic}",
			"",
			"**Effect:** A ranger can only add this to a *fire trap*. If the triggering creature fails its Reflex save, it catches on fire, taking 1d6 points of fire damage at the start of its turn for 1d4 rounds. The burning creature can attempt a new save as a full-round action. Dropping and rolling on the ground grants a +4 bonus on this save.",
			"",
			"### Channeled Energy Trap (Ex or Su)",
			"",
			"{SOURCE Kobolds of Golarion}",
			"",
			"**Effect:** This trap creates a positive or negative energy effect designed to harm either undead or living creatures, respectively. The target takes a number of points of damage equal to 1d8 + the ranger's level from either positive energy or negative energy (Will save for half). If this is an extraordinary trap, the ranger must supply a vial of {equipment-weapon/holy water} (positive energy) or unholy water (negative energy).",
			"",
			"### Cleansing Trap (Ex or Su)",
			"",
			"{SOURCE People of the Wastes}",
			"",
			"**Effect:** Effect The trap suppresses the target's ability to use one randomly selected attack, ability, or quality that creates a disease or poison effect; this lasts for 1 round per ranger level. If the creature has more than one such attack, ability, or quality that creates a disease or poison effect, the attack, ability, or quality to be suppressed when the creature is affected by this trap is determined at random from those not already suppressed.",
			"",
			"### Decoy Trap (Su)",
			"",
			"{SOURCE Ranged Tactics Toolbox}",
			"",
			"**Effect:** The trap creates a shadowy humanoid figment that appears to move away from the triggering creature or that follows a simple program of no more than 25 words defined by the ranger at the time when the trap is set. Unless programmed otherwise, the figment appears 60 feet away from the triggering creature or as close to that distance as possible, and then moves away toward the nearest exit, if any. The figment can move up to 60 feet per round. A viewer can attempt a Will save or a Perception check to disbelieve the illusion if she attacks it or otherwise interacts with it. The Will save DC to disbelieve the illusion is the same as the DC to avoid the trap; the DC of the Perception check to disbelieve the illusion is equal to 5 + the DC to avoid the trap.",
			"",
			"### Dirty Trick Trap (Ex or Su)",
			"",
			"{SOURCE Ranged Tactics Toolbox}",
			"",
			"**Effect:** If the triggering creature fails its saving throw against the trap or is struck by the trap's attack, the trap also attempts a dirty trick combat maneuver against the triggering creature. The type of dirty trick is chosen when the trap is created, and if it isn't possible or isn't applicable to the triggering creature, the combat maneuver is wasted. The trap's CMB for the dirty trick is equal to the ranger's level + his Wisdom modifier.",
			"",
			"### Distraction Trap (Ex or Su)",
			"",
			"{SOURCE Kobolds of Golarion}",
			"",
			"**Effect:** The target is affected with irritation that detracts from its alertness. It takes a -2 penalty on Perception checks, initiative checks, and Reflex saves for 10 minutes per ranger level. If this is a supernatural trap, this is a mind-affecting effect. If this is an extraordinary trap, the ranger must supply a dose of {equipment-weapon/itching powder} or another alchemical irritant.",
			"",
			"**Magical Component:** *scroll of {spell/daze monster}*",
			"",
			"### Exploding Trap (Ex or Su)",
			"",
			"{SOURCE Ultimate Magic}",
			"",
			"**Effect:** A ranger can only add this to a *fire trap*. The trap explodes in fire, filling all squares adjacent to the trap and dealing a number of points of fire damage equal to 1d6 + 1/2 the ranger's level (Reflex negates). If it is an extraordinary trap, the ranger must use an explosive material such as {equipment-weapon/alchemist's fire} when setting the trap.",
			"",
			"### Fire Trap (Ex or Su)",
			"",
			"{SOURCE Ultimate Magic}",
			"",
			"**Effect:** The trap explodes in flames, dealing a number of points of fire damage equal to 1d6 + 1/2 the ranger's level to the triggering creature (Reflex negates). If it is an extraordinary trap, the ranger must use an explosive material such as {equipment-weapon/alchemist's fire} when setting the trap.",
			"",
			"### Firework Trap (Ex or Su)",
			"",
			"{SOURCE Champions of Balance}",
			"",
			"**Effect:** A ranger can add this augmentation to a *fire* or *smoke trap*. The trap explodes in a flash of colored lights. All creatures within 10 feet must succeed at a saving throw (Fortitude if an extraordinary firework trap, Will if supernatural) or be blinded for 1d4+1 rounds. If this is an extraordinary trap, the ranger must use an alchemical weapon when setting the trap, such as {equipment-weapon/flash powder} or a [firework](equipment-weapon/firework_star_candle).",
			"",
			"### Freezing Trap (Su)",
			"",
			"{SOURCE Ultimate Magic}",
			"",
			"**Effect:** The trap creates a burst of ice that damages and encases the triggering creature. The creature takes 1d3 points of cold damage + 1/4 the ranger's level and is entangled and stuck to the ground, similar to the effect of a tanglefoot bag. A successful Reflex save halves the damage and means the creature is not stuck to the floor by the ice. The ice is 1 inch thick per 2 Hit Dice of the ranger (minimum 1), has hardness 0 and 3 hit points per inch of thickness, and melts in 2d4 rounds.",
			"",
			"### Infected Snare Trap (Ex or Su)",
			"",
			"{SOURCE People of the Wastes}",
			"",
			"**Effect:** Effect A ranger can add this only to a snare trap. The snare is made of diseased materials, which contain an aggressive blight that saps the energy and bodily health from the target creature. When initially caught in the snare, the trapped creature must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw or immediately take 2 points of Constitution damage. Each subsequent hour, the creature must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw or take 2 points of Constitution damage. This effect lasts for 12 hours or until the creature makes two successful saving throws in a row, whichever comes first. This is a poison effect.",
			"",
			"### Lazurite Trap (Ex or Su)",
			"",
			"{SOURCE Kobolds of Golarion}",
			"",
			"**Effect:** Lazurite radiation increases the victim's susceptibility to the attacks of undead creatures that are bolstered by the radiation. The target takes a -2 penalty to Armor Class against the attacks of undead creatures and on saving throws against effects created by undead. This effect lasts for 10 minutes per ranger level. A successful Will save negates this effect. If this is an extraordinary trap, the ranger must supply a [sliver of lazurite](equipment-material/lazurite).",
			"",
			"### Limning Trap (Ex or Su)",
			"",
			"{SOURCE Champions of Balance}",
			"",
			"**Effect:** This trap sprays glowing dust into the trapped square and all adjacent squares. A creature covered in this dust glows like a candle (becoming visibly outlined if invisible) and takes a -20 penalty on Stealth checks. The dust's effects last for 1 round per ranger level or until the creature washes it off (a move action requiring water or some other cleanser). If this is an extraordinary trap, the ranger must use alchemical components when setting the trap, such as {equipment-misc/glowing ink} or {equipment-misc/marker dye}.",
			"",
			"### Marking Trap (Ex or Su)",
			"",
			"{SOURCE Ultimate Magic}",
			"",
			"**Effect:** If the triggering creature fails its save against the trap, it is marked with a dye and/or scent of the ranger's choosing. A scent mark decreases the DC of tracking the marked creature by scent by 4. The mark can be washed off with vigorous scrubbing, but fades on its own over several days.",
			"",
			"### Oversized Barbs (Ex or Su)",
			"",
			"{SOURCE Kobolds of Golarion}",
			"",
			"**Effect:** The target is speared with barbs that penetrate and protrude from its body, making squeezing, climbing, and swimming challenging. The trap implants 1d4+1 barbs, each dealing 1 point of damage. A successful Reflex save halves the number of barbs. The target takes a penalty on Climb checks and Swim checks equal to the number of barbs attached, and is considered one size category larger for the purposes of determining what size of opening or passageway it must squeeze through as long as at least 1 barb remains attached. Each barb can be removed with a full minute of work and a Heal check that equals or exceeds the trap's DC. If this check fails, the barb is still removed but the target takes 1d4 points of damage. The barbs shake loose harmlessly after 10 minutes per ranger level.",
			"",
			"### Penetrating Trap (Ex or Su)",
			"",
			"{SOURCE Magical Marketplace}",
			"",
			"**Effect:** A ranger can only add this to a wounding trap. The damage die of a penetrating trap increases to 1d8. Choose either adamantine, cold iron, or silver. The trap counts as that material for the purposes of overcoming damage reduction. If this is an extraordinary trap, the ranger must provide 1 pound of the chosen material during the trap's construction.",
			"",
			"### Pit Trap (Ex or Su)",
			"",
			"{SOURCE Kobolds of Golarion}",
			"",
			"**Effect:** This simple pit is covered over with leaves or appropriate materials for the area. It's 5 feet deep plus 5 feet for every 4 ranger levels. A victim that succeeds at a Reflex save doesn't fall into the pit. If it is an extraordinary trap, the ranger can set this trap only in terrain with soft ground.",
			"",
			"**Magical Component:** *scroll of {spell/create pit}*",
			"",
			"### Poison Trap (Ex or Su)",
			"",
			"{SOURCE Ultimate Magic}",
			"",
			"**Effect:** The trap poisons the creature that triggers it. If it is a supernatural trap, the poison deals 1d2 Con damage per round for 6 rounds. If it is an extraordinary trap, the ranger must provide 1 dose of contact, inhaled, or injury poison when setting the trap, and the trap uses that poison's effects and DC.",
			"",
			"### Quicksand Trap (Su)",
			"",
			"{SOURCE Magical Marketplace}",
			"",
			"**Effect:** The trap and all adjacent squares become quicksand as long as they contain loose sand or soil. The Swim DC to move in this quicksand is equal to the trap's save DC, and the Swim DC to tread in the quicksand is equal to the trap's DC - 5. The quicksand lasts for a number of rounds equal to the ranger's level. When the effect ends, any creature still in the quicksand is returned to the surface prone.",
			"",
			"### Rust Monster Trap (Ex or Su)",
			"",
			"{SOURCE Kobolds of Golarion}",
			"",
			"**Effect:** The trap throws up a cloud of dust ground from the antennae of a rust monster, dealing 1d4 points of damage to the target's metal armor and weapons. A ranger may increase the damage by 1 point for each additional daily use of his trap ability he spends when creating this trap. A successful Reflex save negates this damage. If this is an extraordinary trap, the ranger must supply a set of [rust monster antennae](monster/rust_monster).",
			"",
			"**Magical Component:** *scroll of {spell/rusting grasp}*",
			"",
			"### Selective Trigger (Ex or Su)",
			"",
			"{SOURCE Kobolds of Golarion}",
			"",
			"**Effect:** The ranger adds a race, type, alignment, or minimum weight restriction to the trap's trigger. If this is an extraordinary trap, the ranger can choose only the minimum weight restriction.",
			"",
			"**Magical Component:** *potion of {spell/identify}*",
			"",
			"### Sleet Trap (Su)",
			"",
			"{SOURCE Ultimate Magic}",
			"",
			"**Effect:** The detonating trap creates a 20-foot-radius burst of sleet with the effects of a {spell/sleet storm}. The driving sleet lasts for 1 round, but the icy ground persists for 1 round per ranger level.",
			"",
			"### Smoke Trap (Ex or Su)",
			"",
			"{SOURCE Champions of Balance}",
			"",
			"**Effect:** This trap bellows out thick, choking smoke that fills the trapped square and all adjacent squares. Any breathing creature in these squares must succeed at a Fortitude saving throws or take a -4 penalty to Strength and Dexterity every round it's within the smoke and for 1d4+1 rounds after leaving the smoke. All sight, even darkvision, is ineffective in or through the smoke. The smoke lasts for 1 round per 2 ranger levels, and is dispersed by wind as fog cloud. If this is an extraordinary trap, the ranger must use an alchemical component when setting the trap, such as a {equipment-misc/smokestick}.",
			"",
			"### Snare Trap (Ex or Su)",
			"",
			"{SOURCE Ultimate Magic}",
			"",
			"**Effect:** The trap constricts around a limb or other part of the triggering creature's body (Reflex avoids). The creature cannot move from the location of the trap, unless the ranger included a \"leash\" when setting the trap, in which case the creature is limited to the length of the leash. The trapped creature can escape with an Escape Artist check (DC equal to the trap's DC) as a full-round action. The trap or its leash has a number of hit points equal to 1/2 the ranger's level, or can be burst as a full-round action with a DC 25 Strength check. The trap can hold up to a Medium creature; each extra daily use of the ranger's trap ability spent when the trap is set increases the maximum size of creature the trap can hold. At the ranger's option, if there is a tall object or structure nearby, she can have the trap lift the creature.",
			"",
			"### Spell-Stealing Trap (Su)",
			"",
			"{SOURCE Kobolds of Golarion}",
			"",
			"**Effect:** The target is struck by a burst of abjuration that steals its magical ability. The target loses 1d4+1 levels of spells (of its choice). A ranger may increase the number of spell levels lost by 1d4 for each additional daily use of his trap ability he spends when creating this trap.",
			"",
			"**Magical Component:** *scroll of {spell/dispel magic}*",
			"",
			"### Spell-Storing Trap (Su)",
			"",
			"{SOURCE Kobolds of Golarion}",
			"",
			"**Effect:** This trap behaves like a {spell/greater glyph of warding}, except the maximum level of spell it can hold is 1. A ranger may increase the maximum level by 1 for each daily use of his trap ability he spends when creating this trap. The spell contained must be supplied by either the ranger or another creature within 1 round of the trap being laid. The duration of this trap is dependent on the ranger's level, but a target receives only one save, that of the spell contained.",
			"",
			"### Summoned Ally Trap (Su)",
			"",
			"{SOURCE Ranged Tactics Toolbox}",
			"",
			"**Effect:** The trap summons a creature as [summon nature's ally I](spell/summon_natures_ally_1) with a caster level equal to the ranger's level - 3. This trap functions as [summon nature's ally II](spell/summon_natures_ally_2) at 8th level, [summon nature's ally III](spell/summon_natures_ally_3) at 11th level, and [summon nature's ally IV](spell/summon_natures_ally_4) at 14th level. The summoned creature or creatures appear in a location within the trap's range designated when the trap is set; if it's not possible for the creatures to appear in that location, they appear in the nearest unoccupied space. The ranger can choose a command of no more than 25 words when the trap is created; the creature or creatures follow those instructions, or otherwise attack the creature that triggered the trap.",
			"",
			"### Swarm Trap (Ex or Su)",
			"",
			"{SOURCE Ultimate Magic}",
			"",
			"**Effect:** The trap releases a {monster/bat swarm}, {monster/rat swarm}, or {monster/spider swarm} that attacks all creatures in the area. The swarm remains in the general area for no longer than 1 round per ranger level, after which it disperses. If the trap is an extraordinary trap, the ranger must provide the creatures of the swarm (typically in a small box, cage, or crate); these creatures may die of starvation before the trap is triggered (an extraordinary trap lasts 1 day per level).",
			"",
			"### Tar Trap (Ex or Su)",
			"",
			"{SOURCE Kobolds of Golarion}",
			"",
			"**Effect:** The target is coated in a thin layer of sticky tar unless it succeeds at a Reflex save. It is entangled, and becomes susceptible to catching fire from any source of flame. If lit on fire, the tar burns intensely for 1 round; it deals 2d6 points of fire damage and is destroyed in the process. Unless burned away, the tar remains for 1 round per ranger level. If this is an extraordinary trap, the ranger must supply a dose of tar.",
			"",
			"### Telepathy Trap (Su)",
			"",
			"{SOURCE Demon Hunter's Handbook}",
			"",
			"**Effect:** The trap resonates at a high-pitched frequency audible only to creatures that communicate via telepathy. If the triggering creature has the ability to communicate via telepathy, the creature becomes overwhelmed by psychic feedback. The trapped creature is staggered for 1d4 rounds (Will negates), and may not communicate telepathically during this time. This is a sonic, mind-affecting effect. Creatures that lack telepathy are not affected by this trap, though they may still trigger it.",
			"",
			"### Toxic Fumes Trap (Ex or Su)",
			"",
			"{SOURCE Champions of Balance}",
			"",
			"**Effect:** A ranger can add this to a smoke trap. The smoke this trap creates is extremely noxious. Any breathing creature must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw (in addition to the Fortitude save for the smoke trap) or be nauseated every round it's within the smoke and for 1d4+1 rounds after leaving the smoke. If this is an extraordinary trap, the ranger must use a toxic material when setting the trap, such as [noxious aromatic](equipment-weapon/noxious_aromatic_flask).",
			"",
			"### Transdimensional Trap (Su)",
			"",
			"{SOURCE Kobolds of Golarion}",
			"",
			"**Effect:** This augmentation allows a trap to affect an incorporeal or ethereal creature as if it were corporeal or existed on the Material Plane.",
			"",
			"**Magical Component:** *scroll of {spell/ghostbane dirge}*",
			"",
			"### Transpositional Trap (Su)",
			"",
			"{SOURCE Demon Hunter's Handbook}",
			"",
			"**Effect:** This pair of traps causes any creature that steps in one of the traps to be teleported to the location of the other trap (Will negates), as the spell {spell/dimension door}. After having been transported, the creature may not take any other actions until its next turn. If one part of a pair of transpositional traps becomes blocked by a solid body or object, the trap does not function until the obstruction is removed. In order to create this trap, a ranger must set up two transpositional traps within 400 feet of each other, thus expending 2 uses of the ranger's traps per day. A ranger can only have one pair of transpositional traps set at a time; setting a third transpositional trap immediately causes the first to disappear and keys the second and third transpositional traps to one another.",
			"",
			"### Tripwire (Ex or Su)",
			"",
			"{SOURCE Kobolds of Golarion}",
			"",
			"**Effect:** A taut wire stretched between two vertical surfaces knocks the target prone unless it succeeds at a Reflex save. A running or charging creature takes a -6 penalty on its save.",
			"",
			"### Wounding Trap (Ex or Su)",
			"",
			"{SOURCE Magical Marketplace}",
			"",
			"**Effect:** This trap makes a melee attack against the target using the ranger's base attack bonus + his Wisdom modifier for the attack roll. It deals an amount of damage equal to 1d6 + 1/2 the ranger's level. The ranger chooses whether this damage is bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing. If this is a supernatural trap, the attack counts as magical for the purposes of overcoming damage reduction."

			"**Armor Piercer&ast; (Ex)** ([Monster Hunter's Handbook pg. 9](source/monster_hunters_handbook)): A rogue with this talent can cause her sneak attacks to pierce through natural armor. When she hits with an attack that deals sneak attack damage, she can forgo one or more of her sneak attack dice to reduce the target's natural armor bonus by that amount (minimum natural armor bonus of +0) until the end of her next turn. A creature cannot be affected by this ability again for 1 minute.",
			"",
			"&dagger;**Befuddling Strike&ast; (Ex)** ([Advanced Player's Guide pg. 1](source/advanced_players_guide)): When the rogue deals sneak attack damage against an opponent, that opponent takes a -2 penalty on attack rolls against the rogue for 1d4 rounds.",
			"",
			"**Bleeding Attack&ast; (Ex)** ([PRPG Core Rulebook pg. 68](source/prpg_core_rulebook)): A rogue with this ability can cause living opponents to bleed by hitting them with a sneak attack. This attack causes the target to take 1 additional point of damage each round for each die of the rogue's sneak attack (e.g., 4d6 equals 4 points of bleed). Bleeding creatures take that amount of damage every round at the start of each of their turns. The bleeding can be stopped by a DC 15 Heal check or the application of any effect that heals hit point damage. Bleeding damage from this ability does not stack with itself. Bleeding damage bypasses any damage reduction the creature might possess.",
			"",
			"**Distracting Attack&ast; (Ex)** ([Advanced Player's Guide pg. 1](source/advanced_players_guide)): A rogue with this talent can make sneak attacks with subtle flourishes that disorient and distract her enemy. When she hits a creature with a melee attack that deals sneak attack damage, she can forgo the additional damage to cause the creature to become flat-footed against one target of her choosing until the beginning of her next turn. The rogue cannot designate herself as the creature gaining the benefit of this talent. Creatures with uncanny dodge are immune to distracting attack.",
			"",
			"**Emboldening Strike&ast; (Ex)** ([Blood of Shadows pg. 8](source/blood_of_shadows)): When a rogue with this talent hits a creature with a melee attack that deals sneak attack damage, she gains a +1 circumstance bonus on saving throws for every 2 sneak attack dice rolled (minimum +1) for 1 round.",

			"**Extinguishing Strike&ast; (Ex)** ([Blood of Shadows pg. 8](source/blood_of_shadows)): When a rogue with this talent hits a creature with a melee attack that deals sneak attack damage, any nonmagical light sources worn or carried by the creature (such as lit torches, lanterns, or sunrods) are automatically extinguished. Once per day, the rogue can use this ability to also attempt a dispel check (as per dispel magic) against any magical sources of light a target carries, using her rogue level as the caster level.",
			"",
			"**Focusing Attack&ast; (Ex)** ([Blood of Shadows pg. 8](source/blood_of_shadows)): When a rogue selects this talent, she must choose the confused, shaken, or sickened condition. When the rogue has the selected condition and hits a creature with a melee attack that deals sneak attack damage, the rogue no longer has that condition. A rogue can take this talent up to three times. Each time, she must select a different condition that she is able to remove from herself with a melee attack that deals sneak attack damage. Even if the rogue has taken this talent multiple times, she can remove only a single effect on herself with each melee attack that deals sneak attack damage.",
			"",
			"**Obscuring Blow&ast; (Ex)** ([Blood of Shadows pg. 8](source/blood_of_shadows)): Once per day, the rogue can forgo her potential to deal sneak attack damage to attempt to cloud an opponent's vision. She must declare the use of obscuring blow before she makes the attack. If the attack hits, it does normal damage but, instead of dealing sneak attack damage (and any effect that triggers when the rogue deals sneak attack damage), the target treats all other creatures as if they had concealment, suffering a 20% miss chance on all attack rolls for a number of rounds equal to half the rogue's level. A successful Fortitude saving throw reduces this effect to 1 round. The DC of this saving throw is equal to 10 + 1/2 the rogue's level + the rogue's Intelligence modifier.",
			"",
			"&dagger;**Offensive Defense&ast; (Ex)** ([Advanced Player's Guide pg. 1](source/advanced_players_guide)): When a rogue with this talent hits a creature with a melee attack that deals sneak attack damage, the rogue gains a +1 dodge bonus to AC for each sneak attack die rolled for 1 round.",

			"**Powerful Sneak&ast; (Ex)** ([Advanced Player's Guide pg. 1](source/advanced_players_guide)): Whenever a rogue with this talent takes a full attack action, she can elect to take a -2 penalty on all attack rolls until the start of her next turn. If an attack during this time is a sneak attack, she treats all 1s on the sneak attack damage dice as 2s. &Dagger;*[She can reroll multiple dice, but she can't reroll any individual die more than once per attack.]*",
			"",
			"&dagger;**Sacred Sneak Attack&ast; (Su)** ([Champions of Purity pg. 25](source/champions_of_purity)): When making a sneak attack against an undead creature or evil outsider, the rogue's sneak attack damage is considered good-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. Normal weapon damage is unaffected for this attack. A rogue must have a good alignment to select this rogue talent.",
			"",
			"**Sever Alignment&ast; (Su)** ([Distant Realms pg. 13](source/distant_realms)): When making a sneak attack against an opponent with an alignment subtype, a rogue with this talent can forgo her sneak attack damage to scramble the creature's metaphysical nature. If the attack succeeds, the rogue deals weapon damage as normal, and the target must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC = 10 + half the rogue's level + the rogue's Intelligence modifier) or lose all damage reduction overcome by aligned weapons (such as DR 10/good), lose all regeneration overcome by aligned sources (such as regeneration 10 [good](source/distant_realms). The rogue must have the aligned sneak attack talent to select this talent.",
			"",
			"**Shadow's Chill&ast; (Su)** ([Blood of Shadows pg. 8](source/blood_of_shadows)): When a rogue with this talent hits a creature with a melee weapon that deals sneak attack damage, a number of points of the damage dealt equal to the number of sneak attack dice rolled is cold damage. The remainder of the sneak attack damage and the normal weapon damage are unaffected. The rogue must have cold resistance from a racial trait before selecting this talent.",
			"",
			"**Silencing Strike&ast; (Su)** ([Adventurer's Guide pg. 53](source/adventurers_guide)): Using magic stolen from the [Hellknights](rule/aff_lawknights), Council agents can render foes silent. When a creature is damaged by the rogue's sneak attack, the rogue magically renders the creature mute for 1 round unless it succeeds at a Will save (DC = 10 + half the rogue's level + the rogue's Charisma modifier). Silencing strike can be used a number of times per day equal to half the rogue's level.",
			"",
			"**Slow Reactions&ast; (Ex)** ([PRPG Core Rulebook pg. 68](source/prpg_core_rulebook)): Opponents damaged by the rogue's sneak attack can't make attacks of opportunity for 1 round.",
			"",
			"&dagger;**Sneaky Maneuver&ast; (Ex)** ([Magical Marketplace pg. 26](source/magical_marketplace)): Anytime a rogue with this talent could hit an opponent with a melee sneak attack on her turn, she may take a -2 penalty on her attack roll and attempt a dirty trick, disarm, steal, sunder, or trip combat maneuver instead of dealing sneak attack damage. If the attack succeeds, the rogue deals weapon damage as normal and then attempts a combat maneuver check as a swift action (the -2 penalty only applies to the initial attack roll, not the combat maneuver check). This combat maneuver still provokes attacks of opportunity unless the rogue has a feat or ability that allows her to perform it without provoking attacks of opportunity.",
			"",
			"&dagger;**Stem the Flow&ast; (Su)** ([Champions of Purity pg. 25](source/champions_of_purity)): When making a successful sneak attack against a creature with the ability to channel energy, the rogue may forgo 3d6 points of sneak attack damage to instead prevent the target from channeling energy for a number of rounds equal to half her rogue level.",
			"",
			"**Underhanded&ast; (Ex)** ([Ultimate Combat pg. 1](source/ultimate_combat)): A rogue with this talent gains a +4 circumstance bonus on all Sleight of Hand checks made to conceal a weapon. Furthermore, if she makes a sneak attack during the surprise round using a concealed weapon that her opponent didn't know about, she does not have to roll sneak attack damage, and the sneak attack deals maximum damage. A rogue can only use the underhanded talent a number of times per day equal to her Charisma modifier (minimum 0).",
			"",
			"**Accurate Poisoner (Ex)** ([Potions and Poisons pg. 13](source/potions_and_poisons)): A rogue with this talent delivers poisons with deadly precision. When the rogue successfully hits an opponent with a poisoned weapon and would deal sneak attack damage, she can forgo the sneak attack damage and increase the poison's potency. If she does, the poison's duration increases by 2 (for example, large scorpion venom lasts for 8 rounds instead of 6 rounds, and drow poison lasts for 4 minutes instead of 2 minutes).",
			"",
			"&dagger;**Acrobatic Assist (Ex)** ([Cohorts and Companions pg. 27](source/cohorts_and_companions)): You can expend an attack of opportunity to perform an aid another action to assist an adjacent ally's Acrobatics check, so long as he makes the check as part of movement that passes through your space or an adjacent space. Additionally, whenever you use the aid another action to assist an ally in making an Acrobatics check and you succeed, your ally gains a +1 dodge bonus to AC against attacks of opportunity caused when he moves out of or within a threatened area, until the end of his turn.",
			"",
			"&dagger;**Acrobatic Stunt (Ex)** ([Inner Sea Combat pg. 16](source/inner_sea_combat)): Once per day, when flanked by at least two opponents, a rogue with this talent can, as an immediate action when any of the threatening opponents attacks her, attempt an Acrobatics check against the highest CMD of the threatening creatures plus 2 per threatening creature beyond the second. If successful, the rogue may take a 5-foot step in any direction, so long as she remains within the reach of the attacker triggering the movement. The rogue's final position is used to determine whether the attacker benefits from flanking. On a failed check, the rogue falls prone in her original position and the attack resolves as normal (the opponent gains a +4 bonus for attacking a prone target). A rogue may use this ability one additional time per day for every 5 rogue levels she possesses. A rogue must be trained in Acrobatics to select this talent.",
			"",
			"**Aligned Sneak Attack (Su)** ([Distant Realms pg. 13](source/distant_realms)): When making a sneak attack against a creature that has damage reduction that can be overcome by weapons of a particular alignment (such as DR 5/good), the rogue's attack reduces that damage reduction by an amount equal to the number of sneak attack dice rolled until the end of the rogue's turn.",
			"",
			"**Ambuscading Grapple (Ex)** ([Monster Hunter's Handbook pg. 9](source/monster_hunters_handbook)): When a rogue with this talent succeeds at a combat maneuver check to grapple an unaware opponent, she can immediately deal her sneak attack damage to the target. This counts as having hit with a sneak attack for the purpose of other abilities and talents.",
			"",
			"**Aspexia's Mysticism (Ex)** ([Adventurer's Guide pg. 53](source/adventurers_guide)): The rogue has been trained in a minor occult technique. The rogue gains Psychic Sensitivity as a bonus feat.",
			"",
			"**Assault Leader (Ex)** ([Advanced Player's Guide pg. 1](source/advanced_players_guide)): Once per day, when the rogue misses with an attack on a flanked opponent, she can designate a single ally who is also flanking the target that her attack missed. That ally can make a single melee attack against the opponent as an immediate action.",
			"",
			"**Bardic Pretender (Ex)** ([Pathfinder #130: City in the Lion's Eye pg. 76](source/pathfinder_130_city_in_the_lions_eye)): The rogue knows enough about music and performance to survive in a bardic college and can fake what she doesn't know. The rogue qualifies as having the inspire competence bardic performance class feature for the purpose of meeting prestige class requirements, although this talent doesn't grant her the bardic performance ability.",
			"",
			"**Black Market Connections (Ex)** ([Ultimate Combat pg. 1](source/ultimate_combat)): A rogue with this talent gains better access to magic items from black market connections. She treats every settlement as one size greater for the purpose of determining the gp limit of the base value of items for sale, as well as the number of minor, medium, and major magic items for sale in the settlement. If the settlement is already a metropolis, all minor and medium magic items are for sale, as well as 3d8 major magic items. With a successful Diplomacy check, the rogue can treat the settlement as two sizes larger. If the settlement is already a metropolis and she succeeds at the check, all magic items are for sale. If the settlement is already a large city and she succeeds at the check, all minor and medium magic items are for sale, as well as 3d8 major magic items. With a successful check, the rogue can also sell stolen items on the black market. If the check fails by 5 or more, the rogue does something to spook the market, and treats the city as normal for 1 week. Furthermore, those in control of the black market may alert the authorities to the rogue's presence in an act of reprisal for spooking the market or to divert attention away from their illicit activities. The DCs of the checks are by settlement size and are given in the table below.",

			"**Camouflage (Ex)** ([Advanced Player's Guide pg. 1](source/advanced_players_guide)): Once per day, a rogue with this talent can craft simple but effective camouflage from the surrounding foliage. The rogue needs 1 minute to prepare the camouflage, but once she does, it is good for the rest of the day or until the rogue fails a saving throw against an area effect spell that deals fire, cold, or acid damage, whichever comes first. The rogue gains a +4 bonus on Stealth checks while within terrain that matches the foliage used to make the camouflage. This ability cannot be used in areas without natural foliage.",
			"",
			"**Canny Observer (Ex)** ([Advanced Player's Guide pg. 1](source/advanced_players_guide)): When a rogue with this talent makes a Perception check to hear the details of a conversation or to find concealed or secret objects (including doors and traps), she gains a +4 bonus.",
			"",
			"&dagger;**Card Sharp (Su)** ([The Harrow Handbook pg. 20](source/the_harrow_handbook)): The rogue gains {feat/Deadly Dealer} as a bonus feat, even if she does not meet the prerequisites.

Once per day, the rogue can reroll a skill check she just made with the selected skill and take the better result. She can use this reroll with the selected skill one additional time per day at 10th level and every 5 levels thereafter. A rogue can select this talent multiple times.

She gains the renown vigilante [social talent](ability/social_talents). This community can be an entire settlement or portions of a settlement (such as a particular district or neighborhood), depending on the population as allowed by the renown social talent. Anytime she could select another rogue talent, the rogue can also select from the following list of {ability/social talents}, using her rogue level as her vigilante level for the purpose meeting of prerequisites: celebrity discount, celebrity perks, gossip collector, great renown, incredible renown, loyal aid, and safe house.

			"",
			"**Cloying Shades (Su)** ([Blood of Shadows pg. 7](source/blood_of_shadows)): When a rogue with this talent uses {spell/dimension door} as a spell or spell-like ability, including the abundant step or shadow jump class feature, then all creatures adjacent to the rogue at the start and end of her teleportation are entangled by grasping shadows for 1 round (although the creatures are not anchored in place). A successful Reflex saving throw negates this effect. The DC of this saving throw is equal to 10 + 1/2 the rogue's level + the rogue's Intelligence or Charisma modifier (whichever is higher). The rogue must have dimension door as a spell or spell-like ability (including the abundant step or shadow jump class feature) before choosing this talent.",

			"",
			"&dagger;**Convincing Lie (Ex)** ([Ultimate Combat pg. 1](source/ultimate_combat)): When a rogue with this talent lies, she creates fabrications so convincing that others treat them as truth. When a rogue with this talent successfully uses the Bluff skill to convince someone that what she is saying is true, if that individual is questioned later about the statement or story, that person uses the rogue's Bluff skill modifier to convince the questioner, rather than his own. If his Bluff skill modifier is better than the rogue's, the individual can use his own modifier and gain a +2 bonus on any check to convince others of the lie.

The target must succeed at a Will save (DC = 10 + the number of sneak attack dice sacrificed + your Charisma modifier) or become distracted until the start of your next turn. Distracted opponents are entirely focused on you, and pay little attention to their surroundings; they are not considered to be observing other characters within 30 feet, allowing them to attempt Stealth checks to hide. A distracted opponent automatically fails Perception checks against creatures more than 30 feet away.",
			"",
			"&dagger;**Demon Lantern (Sp)** ([The Harrow Handbook pg. 20](source/the_harrow_handbook)): Once per day when she casts dancing lights, the rogue can conjure a single demon's lantern instead of the usual four lights. A demon lantern acts in all ways as a hypnotic pattern spell cast by a wizard, except it also casts light as a torch and it fascinates only a single target whose Hit Dice do not exceed the rogue's class level. The save DC of this effect is equal to 11 + the rogue's Intelligence modifier. The rogue must have an Intelligence score of at least 11 to select this talent.

The vigilante's PC allies do not count as onlookers (and at the GM's discretion, a closely allied NPC might not count as an onlooker, either). He loses this bonus against onlookers who have already witnessed him using a vigilante talent in his social identity within the last week.",
			"",
			"**Bellflower Innuendo (Ex)** ([Inner Sea Intrigue pg. 33](source/inner_sea_intrigue)): A vigilante with this talent has learned to pass secret messages more efficiently by observing the coded messages of the [Bellflower Network](rule/aff_antislavery) or another secret organization. He can pass a secret message with Bluff in the same amount of time it would normally take to convey the message without encryption. The words and meaning of his secret messages cannot be gleaned from him or those he directly delivered the message to by divinations unless the caster succeeds at a caster level check (DC = 15 + the vigilante's level).",
			"",
			"**Case the Joint (Ex)** ([Ultimate Intrigue pg. 10](source/ultimate_intrigue)): The vigilante can use his social identity to learn important facts about a location before returning later in his vigilante identity. If he spends at least 1 hour in a location while in his social identity, he can attempt a DC 20 Knowledge (engineering) check. If he succeeds, he gains the ability to later reroll any one failed skill check involving the location's layout (such as a Stealth check to sneak into the location, a Disable Device check to disable an alarm, or a Sleight of Hand check to snatch an object from a pedestal). For every 10 by which the check exceeds 20, the vigilante gains an additional reroll. If the vigilante fails to return to the location within 1 week, the situation changes too much and he cannot use the rerolls. A vigilante can't case the same joint more than once a week.",
			"",
			"**Celebrity Discount (Ex)** ([Ultimate Intrigue pg. 10](source/ultimate_intrigue)): The vigilante's social identity is popular enough to receive discounts in his area of renown. Whenever he buys an item in his area of renown that costs 500 gp or less, he can buy it at 90% of the market price, rather than the full price. If he has the great renown social talent, the gp limit increases to 2,000 gp, and if he possesses the incredible renown social talent, the gp limit increases to 8,000 gp. A vigilante must be at least 3rd level and have the renown social talent to select this talent.",
			"",
			"**Celebrity Perks (Ex)** ([Ultimate Intrigue pg. 11](source/ultimate_intrigue)): The vigilante is a celebrity in his area of renown, and adoring fans are all too eager to shower him with the fundamental necessities. While within his area of renown, he can always receive common meals or lodging (worth up to 1 gp per meal or night) for free, and can avoid paying taxes or bribes of 1 gp or less. If he wants a particular nonmagical item worth 1 gp or less, he can spend 1d10 minutes interacting with people in his area of renown to receive the item from a fan (if he ever sells such a gift from a fan, he loses this social talent permanently). If he has the great renown social talent, he can receive gifts of up to 5 gp, receive fine food and lodgings (worth up to 10 gp per meal or night) for free, and avoid paying taxes or bribes of 10 gp or less. If he has incredible renown, he can receive gifts of up to 25 gp, receive exquisite food and lodgings (worth up to 100 gp per meal or night) for free, and avoid paying taxes or bribes of 100 gp or less. A vigilante must be at least 5th level and have the renown social talent to select this talent.",
			"",
			"**Companion to the Lonely (Ex)** ([Inner Sea Intrigue pg. 33](source/inner_sea_intrigue)): Whether religiously motivated, as are followers of Arshea, Calistria, or Shelyn, or for purely carnal reasons, physical intimacy helps the vigilante cope with the loneliness of his double life. Once per day, the vigilante can spend at least 1 hour engaged in acts of physical pleasure with a willing partner to gain a pool of morale points equal to his Charisma bonus or his partner's Charisma bonus, whichever is higher. For the next 24 hours, the vigilante can spend a morale point as an immediate action to roll a Charisma-based skill check or a Will saving throw again after rolling the die but before learning the consequences; he must take the second result even if it is lower.",
			"",
			"**Conflicted Identity (Ex)** ([Antihero's Handbook pg. 16](source/antiheros_handbook)): The vigilante's mind is in a constant state of turmoil, which makes him even more ethically and morally fluid than other vigilantes. When targeted by a harmful spell or effect that would affect the vigilante in his current identity but not his other identity (or when he would suffer a lesser effect in his other identity), he has a 50% chance of being affected as though he were in his other identity. This chance is rolled when the spell or effect is cast or triggered and before any spell resistance roll, if applicable. For example, if a vigilante has a lawful-neutral social identity and a neutral vigilante identity, he has a 50% chance of taking only half damage from a chaos hammer spell while in his social identity, since he would always take only half damage from a chaos hammer spell when in his vigilante identity.",
			"",
			"**Discreet Inquiries (Ex)** ([Inner Sea Intrigue pg. 33](source/inner_sea_intrigue)): The vigilante can attempt Diplomacy checks to gather information without being obvious he is seeking any, whether by buying the silence of informants or by talking foes into revealing information without realizing they are doing so. While the vigilante is in his area of renown, gathering information in this way takes 2d4 hours and costs 2d4 gp. Anyone who might take notice of the information gathering does not notice unless she succeeds at a Sense Motive check opposed by the vigilante's Bluff check. The vigilante gains a +4 bonus on this Bluff check.",
			"",
			"**Double Time (Ex)** ([Ultimate Intrigue pg. 11](source/ultimate_intrigue)): The vigilante's social identity is that of a skilled and respected artisan or professional, rather than a merchant or noble. In order to complete his day's work while still continuing his vigilante activities, he has learned to work faster than normal, hiding his progress so it seems like he is working full shifts at his day job rather than spending some of that time on other pursuits. The vigilante needs to spend only 6 hours each day for mundane uses of the Craft or Profession skill, rather than 8 hours. If he has the social grace social talent, he needs to spend only 4 hours for any skill he's chosen with social grace. A vigilante must have a social identity appropriate to the chosen skill to select this talent.",
			"",
			"**Entrepreneur (Ex)** ([Spymaster's Handbook pg. 26](source/spymasters_handbook)): Select any one Intelligence-, Wisdom-, or Charisma-based skill other than Perception or Use Magic Device. The vigilante can use the selected skill to earn money as if he were using a Profession skill. If he selects Perform or Profession, the vigilante instead gains the skill unlock powers for those skills as appropriate for his number of ranks in that skill. If he has the social grace social talent, he can apply this benefit to all skills selected with the social grace talent.",
			"",
			"**Everyman (Ex)** ([Ultimate Intrigue pg. 11](source/ultimate_intrigue)): The vigilante can take on the appearance of a specific individual whenever he assumes a mundane guise using his many guises social talent. The individual must be a farmer, laborer, or peasant. While disguised as this individual, the vigilante receives a +20 circumstance bonus on Disguise checks to appear as that individual. Any spell or ability designed to locate the individual has a 50% chance of finding the vigilante instead of the actual individual, and divination spells and abilities used on the vigilante give results as if he were the actual individual. Although this doesn't grant the vigilante any special knowledge of the individual, the vigilante's training grants him a +10 circumstance bonus on Bluff checks to properly play the part of the individual. A vigilante must be at least 11th level and have the many guises social talent to select this talent.",
			"",
			"**Feign Innocence (Ex)** ([Ultimate Intrigue pg. 11](source/ultimate_intrigue)): The vigilante's social identity seems so innocent that it is hard to believe he was involved in wrongdoing. Within his area of renown, this provides a nonmagical effect identical to the innocence spell. A vigilante must be at least 5th level and have the renown social talent to take this talent.",
			"",
			"**Gossip Collector (Ex)** ([Ultimate Intrigue pg. 11](source/ultimate_intrigue)): The vigilante sits at the center of a web of gossip, granting him access to the latest scuttlebutt with baffling speed. Whenever the vigilante is presented with a topic about which he would normally need to spend 1d4 hours to gather information, he must spend only 1d2 hours instead. If he has the renown social talent and gathers the information in his area of renown, he must instead spend only 1d4 &times; 10 minutes, and if he beats the DC to gather a piece of information by 20 or more, he knows that piece of information without spending any time at all; he has simply already heard that gossip. This ability doesn't allow him to gather information that isn't available in the locale he is canvassing, even if that locale is his area of renown.",
			"",
			"**Great Renown (Ex)** ([Ultimate Intrigue pg. 11](source/ultimate_intrigue)): The vigilante is known on a broader scale. He can gain renown in a single community of up to 5,000 individuals (a large town) or up to two communities of no more than 2,000 individuals each (two small towns). The bonus while he is in his social identity remains unchanged, but the circumstance bonus on Intimidate checks from his renown social talent while he is in his vigilante identity increases to +6. A vigilante must be at least 7th level and have the renown social talent to select this talent.",
			"",
			"**Guise of Life (Su)** ([Spymaster's Handbook pg. 26](source/spymasters_handbook)): An undead vigilante with this talent gains an additional social identity in the form of one living creature identical to the vigilante's appearance in life. Successful Knowledge checks reveal information about the vigilante as if he were a living creature, and he counts as living for the purpose of divination spells and effects. He gains no other benefit from appearing to be a living creature, and remains vulnerable to positive energy and spells that effect undead. The vigilante must be a corporeal undead creature to select this talent. Humanoid vigilantes with the negative energy affinity racial trait can also select this talent, gaining a human social identity.",
			"",
			"**Guise of Unlife (Su)** ([Spymaster's Handbook pg. 26](source/spymasters_handbook)): A vigilante with this talent gains an additional social identity in the form of an undead version of one of his existing social identities, such as a ghoul, vampire, or zombie. Successful Knowledge checks reveal information about the vigilante as if he were undead, and he counts as undead for the purpose of divination spells and effects. He gains no other benefit from appearing to be an undead creature, and remains vulnerable to negative energy and spells that effect the living. The vigilante must be a living creature to select this talent. ",
			"",
			"**Hidden Magic (Ex)** ([Antihero's Handbook pg. 16](source/antiheros_handbook)): The auras of magic items the vigilante is carrying are hidden (as per magic aura). The vigilante can suppress or reactivate this effect as a standard action. At 11th level, the vigilante and any magic items he is carrying appear to be nonmagical (as if he had cast greater magic aura). The vigilante must be at least 5th level to select this talent.",
			"",
			"**Immediate Change (Ex)** ([Ultimate Intrigue pg. 11](source/ultimate_intrigue)): The vigilante can change identities as a move action, and he no longer needs to spend extra time to adjust his appearance and persona. A vigilante must be at least 13th level and must have the quick change social talent to select this talent.",
			"",
			"**In Vogue (Ex)** ([Ultimate Intrigue pg. 11](source/ultimate_intrigue)): The vigilante's crafting or professional business is always at the height of the local trends, allowing the vigilante to gain more profits than usual. Goods he crafts with a Craft skill he chose with social grace are worth 1/3 more gp than normal due to his celebrity, without increasing the cost to create. Whenever he uses a Profession skill he chose with social grace to make money, he makes twice as much money. A vigilante must be at least 5th level and have both the double time and social grace social talents to take this talent.",
			"",
			"**Incredible Renown (Ex)** ([Ultimate Intrigue pg. 11](source/ultimate_intrigue)): The vigilante is incredibly famous in both identities. He can gain renown in a single community of up to 25,000 individuals (a large city) or up to two smaller cities of no more than 10,000 individuals each (two small cities). The bonus while he is in his social identity remains unchanged, but the circumstance bonus to Intimidate from his great renown social talent while in he is in his vigilante identity increases to +8. A vigilante must be at least 11th level and have the great renown social talent to select this talent.",
			"",
			"**Instant Recognition (Ex)** ([Ultimate Intrigue pg. 11](source/ultimate_intrigue)): The vigilante is so well known that his name precedes him, even to other communities. It only takes 4 hours of effort to get the word out to transfer his renown benefits to a new community. A vigilante must be at least 13th level and have both the incredible renown and triumphant return social talents to select this talent.",
			"",
			"**Intrigue Feats (Ex)** ([Spymaster's Handbook pg. 27](source/spymasters_handbook)): The vigilante gains one of the following feats as a bonus feat: {feat/Blustering Bluff}, {feat/But a Scratch}, {feat/Call Truce}, {feat/Confabulist}, {feat/Criminal Reputation}, {feat/Cutting Humiliation}, {feat/Esoteric Linguistics}, {feat/Intoxicating Flattery}, {feat/Ironclad Logic}, {feat/Nerve-Racking Negotiator}, {feat/Orator}, {feat/Persuasive Bribery}, {feat/Play to the Crowd}, {feat/Quick Favor}, {feat/Rhetorical Flourish}, {feat/Sense Assumptions}, {feat/Sense Relationships}, or {feat/Street Smarts}. He must meet the feat's prerequisites. This talent can be selected multiple times; each time, the vigilante gains a new feat from the above list.",
			"",
			"**Kalistocrat's Acumen (Ex)** ([Inner Sea Intrigue pg. 33](source/inner_sea_intrigue)): A vigilante with this talent must follow the dietary and sexual prohibitions of the [Prophecies of Kalistrade](equipment-misc/the_prophecies_of_kalistrade) in his social identity or he loses the talent's benefit until he atones. He can treat settlements as one size category larger when determining their base values and purchase limits. At 9th level, the vigilante can treat settlements as two size categories larger for the above purposes. At 15th level, the vigilante can treat settlements as four size categories larger for the above purposes.",
			"",
			"**Loyal Aid (Ex)** ([Ultimate Intrigue pg. 11](source/ultimate_intrigue)): The vigilante gains the service of a number of loyal allies who can help him gather information, cover for his two identities, or perform minor tasks. Inside his area of renown, a vigilante with this talent gains a bonus on Diplomacy checks to gather information equal to half his vigilante level.",
			"",
			"In addition, if the vigilante wants, he can task his friends to help cover for him by spreading false tales of his location and activities to others. This has the effect of increasing the DC of Diplomacy checks to gather information about the vigilante and Survival checks to track him by an amount equal to his level. This lasts for 1 day, and can be used only once per week.",
			"",
			"Finally, once per day, the vigilante can ask his allies to perform a minor task for him. This usually involves delivering a message, purchasing a piece of mundane gear worth 100 gp or less (which the vigilante must pay for), or retrieving an object owned by the vigilante (that would be easily accessible by the ally). This task might take other forms as well, subject to GM discretion, but can never involve combat or danger. A vigilante must be at least 3rd level and have the renown social talent to select this talent.",
			"",
			"**Many Guises (Ex)** ([Ultimate Intrigue pg. 12](source/ultimate_intrigue)): The vigilante can take on any number of mundane guises. Whenever he changes his identity, he has a third option (instead of social or vigilante): he can become mundane. The mundane identity is not a specific individual. Each one is created at the moment it is assumed, and quickly forgotten as soon as it is removed. While in a mundane identity, the vigilante does not gain the benefit of either his social or vigilante identity, but instead appears as a member of his race, usually a common laborer, farmer, or peasant of any gender. His alignment is treated as neutral when he is in his mundane identity. While in this identity, he receives a +20 circumstance bonus on Disguise checks to appear like an ordinary member of his race. Spells and abilities that are looking for the vigilante in either of his other identities fail while he is in his mundane identity. He must build the appearance for this identity using whatever clothing and tools he has at his disposal. While he can use magic (such as a hat of disguise), his mundane identity can never be anything other than an ordinary member of a society or large group (subject to GM discretion). A vigilante must be at least 5th level to select this talent.",
			"",
			"**Mockingbird (Ex)** ([Ultimate Intrigue pg. 12](source/ultimate_intrigue)): The vigilante can mimic almost any sort of voice, or even animal calls and sound effects, and he can throw his voice at a distance. This functions similarly to a combination of the ghost sound, ventriloquism, and vocal alteration spells. A vigilante must be at least 5th level to choose this talent.",
			"",
			"**Morphic Mask (Su)** ([Chronicle of Legends pg. 7](source/chronicle_of_legends)): The vigilante's physical form in his vigilante identity can differ significantly from that of his social identity, within the norms for his race&mdash;this can include changes to the vigilante's proportions, coloration, gender characteristics, and other physical characteristics. This increases the vigilante's bonus from seamless guise by 2 for every significant change, as per the Disguise skill. The vigilante always assumes the same form when using this ability. A vigilante with multiple natural forms, such as a {race/kitsune}, can alter each of his forms using this talent. ",
			"",
			"**Notorious Fool (Ex)** ([Antihero's Handbook pg. 16](source/antiheros_handbook)): While in his social identity, the vigilante can feign absentmindedness, clumsiness, drunkenness, or eccentricity very convincingly. When he fails an opposed Sleight of Hand or Stealth check while in his social identity, he can immediately attempt a Bluff check opposed by the onlookers' Sense Motive checks to appear as though he had only blundered or stumbled in a spectacular fashion. If he succeeds at this Bluff check, the onlookers do not realize the vigilante was attempting the action that prompted him to attempt a Sleight of Hand or Stealth check, although being in the wrong place or behaving in an inappropriate manner may still have negative consequences. This talent is ineffective against any onlooker who has already witnessed the vigilante faking a blunder within the last 24 hours.",
			"",
			"**Obscurity (Ex)** ([Blood of the Beast pg. 15](source/blood_of_the_beast)): The vigilante is relatively unknown socially. In fact, he makes a point of keeping the life of his social identity as ordinary as possible. This social talent functions exactly as the renown social talent, but instead of improving the starting attitude of all NPCs within the community, it empowers the vigilante so that he no longer needs to succeed at Disguise checks to appear as his social identity while assuming that identity within his area of obscurity. He still has to attempt Disguise checks when NPCs within this settlement are confronted with indisputable proof that the vigilante could be more than he appears to be, such as when he uses a vigilante talent while in his social identity. This social talent counts as renown for the purpose of meeting the prerequisites of social talents that list renown as a prerequisite and can be improved by such talents. A vigilante with this talent cannot select renown, nor can he select any social talent that requires him to be famous (such as celebrity discount or celebrity perks). ",
			"",
			"**Owl's Sight (Ex)** ([Heroes of Golarion pg. 19](source/heroes_of_golarion)): The vigilante gains low-light vision. If he already has low-light vision, he gains a +4 competence bonus on Perception checks in low light. The vigilante also gains a +2 competence bonus on Sleight of Hand and Stealth checks at night.",
			"",
			"**Quick Change (Ex)** ([Ultimate Intrigue pg. 12](source/ultimate_intrigue)): The vigilante learns to shift between his identities with ease. Instead of needing 1 minute to change his identity, he can now do so as a full-round action. If, after a quick change, he encounters any creature familiar with both of his identities, he must attempt a Disguise check to avoid the creature seeing through his hastily donned disguise and realizing that the identities are, in fact, the same person. The vigilante can spend 1 additional round adjusting and perfecting his appearance and persona to negate the need for this check. A vigilante must be at least 7th level to select this talent. ",
			"",
			"**Renown (Ex)** ([Ultimate Intrigue pg. 12](source/ultimate_intrigue)): The vigilante becomes known for deeds and abilities regardless of his current identity. This renown grants him favorable treatment in civilized company and lends him an air of menace while facing down his enemies. While he is in his social identity, a vigilante can spend 1 week gaining renown among the locals of any community of no more than about 200 individuals ([a village](rule/the_shape_of_civilization)). This could be the entire community or a smaller neighborhood in a larger settlement. He must spend at least 4 hours each day socializing and making contacts. After spending 1 week doing this, whenever he is in his social identity, all NPCs in the community have a starting attitude toward him that is one category better, as long as each person's [initial attitude](skill/diplomacy) would have at least been indifferent. While he gains renown in an area using his social identity, he also spreads rumors and tales about his vigilante identity. Once he has gained renown in a community, he gains a +4 circumstance bonus on Intimidate checks whenever he is in his vigilante identity. This bonus applies only while he is near the community in which he has gained renown; he must be within a number of miles equal to his vigilante level.",
			"",
			"A vigilante can hold renown in a limited number of communities (normally one, with other social talents allowing two). If he gains renown in a new community, he must decide which one of his previous communities to lose. These effects are subject to GM approval. For example, the GM might rule that an NPC or monster has not heard any tales about the vigilante. Or, a foe may have a starting attitude toward him that's one category worse, rather than one category better.",
			"",
			"**Safe House (Ex)** ([Ultimate Intrigue pg. 12](source/ultimate_intrigue)): The vigilante can establish a safe house in his area of renown, and he can change it every time he changes his area of renown. If he doesn't have the renown talent, he can still select this talent and place the safe house in a single location to which he has access, but he can never move the safe house from its initial location until he gains the renown talent. This safe house must be an area no larger in volume than a cube that is a number of feet per side equal to 10 feet per vigilante level. The safe house can be arranged any way he likes and it can be part of a larger building, like a secret room or an underground cave. Objects within this safe house can't be located by any effect that is less powerful than a discern location spell. At 7th level, this protection from being located also applies to creatures in the safe house. At 13th level, the entire area is protected from scrying effects (though not mundane snooping) like a mage's private sanctum.",
			"",
			"**Seemless Shapechanger (Ex)** ([Blood of the Beast pg. 15](source/blood_of_the_beast)): The vigilante seamlessly adopts any persona he assumes with magic. The vigilante adds his seamless guise bonus to the bonus on Disguise checks that he gains to assume the shape of another creature with a polymorph spell or effect. A vigilante must have the shapechanger subtype to select this talent.",
			"",
			"**Skill Familiarity (Ex)** ([Disciple's Doctrine pg. 23](source/disciples_doctrine)): The vigilante choses four skills when he gains this talent. He can take 10 on checks with his chosen skills even when distracted or threatened. If he takes 10 on checks with these skills while not distracted or threatened, he gains a bonus on the check equal to one-quarter his vigilante level (minimum +2). A vigilante must be at least 9th level to select this talent.",
			"",
			"**Social Grace (Ex)** ([Ultimate Intrigue pg. 12](source/ultimate_intrigue)): The vigilante selects any one Intelligence-, Wisdom-, or Charisma-based skill other than Perception or Use Magic Device. Whenever the vigilante is in his social identity, he receives a +4 circumstance bonus on checks with the selected skill. At 5th level and every 4 levels thereafter, he can select another skill (with the same restrictions) to gain this bonus.",
			"",
			"**Songbird (Su)** ([Heroes of Golarion pg. 19](source/heroes_of_golarion)): The vigilante gains the use of {spell/animal messenger} once per day as a spell-like ability, with a caster level equal to his character level. He also gains Handle Animal as a class skill.",
			"",
			"**Subjective Truth (Ex)** ([Ultimate Intrigue pg. 13](source/ultimate_intrigue)): The vigilante's disparate identities allow him to defeat magic that detects lies. As long as what he says is true from the point of view of his current identity, it detects as true to effects such as discern lies, and he can say it in effects such as zone of truth that force him to speak the truth. A vigilante must be at least 9th level and have the feign innocence social talent to select this talent.",
			"",
			"**Transformation Sequence (Su)** ([Blood of the Beast pg. 15](source/blood_of_the_beast)): The vigilante's transformation between identities is assisted by magic. This makes it faster than usual, but also more noticeable. The vigilante can complete the switch between his identities in 5 rounds, improving to a standard action if he has the quick change social talent, and to a swift action if he has the immediate change social talent. However, the transformation causes quite a spectacle, involving loud sounds or music, brilliant colorful energies, and swift motions. A vigilante can select this talent only if he is able to cast spells or spell-like abilities (this needn't be from his vigilante class). A vigilante with the magical child archetype effectively gets this social talent for free at 1st level.",
			"",
			"**Triumphant Return (Ex)** ([Ultimate Intrigue pg. 13](source/ultimate_intrigue)): The vigilante's tales are never truly forgotten. This makes it easier to establish his renown in a place he has established it before. In any settlement where the vigilante previously gained renown, it takes only 3 days, rather than 1 week, to gain renown again. A vigilante must be at least 3rd level and have the renown social talent to select this talent.",
			"",
			"**Well-Known Expert (Ex)** ([Spymaster's Handbook pg. 27](source/spymasters_handbook)): The vigilante's social identity is known as an expert in numerous fields, including areas and topics the vigilante hasn't actually taken the time to study. As a result the vigilante is skilled at encouraging others to discover solutions to difficult problems themselves by asking probing questions, while appearing to give the information himself. ",
			"",
			"In his social identity, the vigilante can take 10 when attempting to aid another on Appraise, Craft, and Knowledge checks. He also gains a bonus equal to half his class level (minimum +1) on Bluff checks to appear knowledgeable in Appraise, Craft (all), and Knowledge (all). If he has the renown social talent, he grants a +3 bonus when he successfully aids another on these skill checks, rather than +2. ",
			"",
			"In his area of renown, the vigilante's social identity is so trusted as an expert that scholars are inspired to make amazing deductions and intuitive leaps in discussions with him. A creature that has already failed a Knowledge check on a specific subject can attempt one additional check to gain information on the same topic if it receives an aid another bonus from the vigilante when doing so."

The number of spirits is countless, and each has its own idiosyncrasies that make it distinct.

All spirits have stories - and some arise from people whose deeds shook the world and whose testaments have endured throughout the ages. These beings are legendary spirits, and they possess great power they can share with mediums who gain their favor.",
			"",
			"Attaining the ability to channel a legendary spirit involves traveling to a certain location or performing a certain deed, swearing an oath, performing a ritual, and succeeding at an ability check. The type of check depends on the spirit, but the DC is always equal to 10 + 1/2 the medium's level. If the medium breaks the oath, the spirit will no longer answer when he calls. If the medium attempts to call another spirit of the legendary spirit's legend, the legendary spirit similarly departs forever.",

If the attack hits, the monk can attempt a free combat maneuver check against the foe (using the base attack bonus of the attack used to hit the foe). If the check is successful, the foe is knocked 10 feet directly away from the monk. This distance increases by 10 feet for every 5 by which the check exceeds the foe's CMD, to a maximum distance equal to the monk's fast movement bonus. This movement does not provoke an attack of opportunity. The foe stops moving if it strikes another creature, barrier, or otherwise solid object. The creature is not knocked prone by this movement. The monk must attack with a kick to use this style strike.",

Unless otherwise noted, a deed can be performed multiple successive times, as long as the swashbuckler has or spends the required number of panache points to perform the deed.",

			"**Derring-Do (Ex)** ([Advanced Class Guide pg. 56](source/advanced_class_guide)): At 1st level, a swashbuckler can spend 1 panache point when she makes an Acrobatics, Climb, Escape Artist, Fly, Ride, or Swim check to roll 1d6 and add the result to the check. She can do this after she makes the check but before the result is revealed. If the result of the d6 roll is a natural 6, she rolls another 1d6 and adds it to the check. She can continue to do this as long as she rolls natural 6s, up to a number of times equal to her Dexterity modifier (minimum 1).",

			"**Dodging Panache (Ex)** ([Advanced Class Guide pg. 57](source/advanced_class_guide)): At 1st level, when an opponent attempts a melee attack against the swashbuckler, the swashbuckler can as an immediate action spend 1 panache point to move 5 feet; doing so grants the swashbuckler a dodge bonus to AC equal to her Charisma modifier (minimum 0) against the triggering attack. This movement doesn't negate the attack, which is still resolved as if the swashbuckler had not moved from the original square. This movement is not a 5-foot step; it provokes attacks of opportunity from creatures other than the one who triggered this deed. The swashbuckler can only perform this deed while wearing light or no armor, and while carrying no heavier than a light load.",

			"**Opportune Parry and Riposte (Ex)** ([Advanced Class Guide pg. 57](source/advanced_class_guide)): At 1st level, when an opponent makes a melee attack against the swashbuckler, she can spend 1 panache point and expend a use of an attack of opportunity to attempt to parry that attack. The swashbuckler makes an attack roll as if she were making an attack of opportunity; for each size category the attacking creature is larger than the swashbuckler, the swashbuckler takes a -2 penalty on this roll. If her result is greater than the attacking creature's result, the creature's attack automatically misses. The swashbuckler must declare the use of this ability after the creature's attack is announced, but before its attack roll is made. Upon performing a successful parry and if she has at least 1 panache point, the swashbuckler can as an immediate action make an attack against the creature whose attack she parried, provided that creature is within her reach. This deed's cost cannot be reduced by any ability or effect that reduces the number of panache points a deed costs.",

To use this deed, a swashbuckler cannot attack with a weapon in her off hand or use a shield other than a buckler. She can even use this ability with thrown light or one-handed piercing melee weapons, so long as the target is within 30 feet of her. Any creature that is immune to sneak attacks is immune to the additional damage granted by precise strike, and any item or ability that protects a creature from critical hits also protects a creature from the additional damage of a precise strike. This additional damage is precision damage, and isn't multiplied on a critical hit.",

The swashbuckler chooses a part of the body to target. If the attack succeeds, in addition to the attack's normal damage, the target suffers one of the following effects based on the part of the body targeted. If a creature doesn't have one of the listed body locations, that body part cannot be targeted. Creatures that are immune to sneak attacks are also immune to targeted strikes. Items or abilities that protect a creature from critical hits also protect a creature from targeted strikes.",

The amount of bleed damage dealt is equal to the swashbuckler's Dexterity modifier (minimum 1). Alternatively, the swashbuckler can spend 2 panache points to deal 1 point of Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution bleed damage instead (swashbuckler's choice). Creatures that are immune to sneak attacks are also immune to these types of bleed damage.",

When fighting defensively in this manner, the dodge bonus to AC gained from that action increases to +4, and the penalty to attack rolls is reduced to -2.",

			"**Perfect Thrust (Ex)** ([Advanced Class Guide pg. 59](source/advanced_class_guide)): At 15th level, while the swashbuckler has at least 1 panache point, she can as a full-round action make a perfect thrust, pooling all of her attack potential into a single melee attack made with a light or one-handed piercing melee weapon. When she does, she makes the attack against the target's touch AC, and ignores all damage reduction.",

Each day, he can implant a number of these tricks equal to 1/2 his mesmerist level (minimum 1) plus his Charisma bonus (if any). He can have only one trick implanted at a given time, and implanting a new trick ends the previous one (the mesmerist still loses the use of this ability he spent on the previous trick).",
			"",
			"To implant a trick, the mesmerist must take a standard action and either touch a willing creature or implant the trick in himself. A creature can be the subject of only one mesmerist trick at a time. The mesmerist can activate the trick as a free action when a triggering condition is met (as defined in the trick's description), even if it isn't his turn. The subject must be within medium range (100 feet + 10 feet per level) for the mesmerist to trigger the trick. The mesmerist monitors for the trick's triggering condition through a subtle telepathic connection, so he doesn't need line of sight to trigger it&mdash;but anything that blocks telepathic contact prevents him from triggering tricks. An implanted trick lasts until the next time the mesmerist regains his spells.",

			"Once triggered, a trick is no longer implanted, and can't be triggered again until the mesmerist implants the trick again. The duration of the effect caused by triggering a trick is either instantaneous or appears in the trick's entry. The DC for any mesmerist trick or masterful trick that requires a saving throw or skill check is 10 + 1/2 the mesmerist's level + the mesmerist's Charisma modifier.",
			"",
			"The mesmerist knows one trick at 1st level, and learns another trick at 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter (to a maximum of 11 tricks at 20th level). Each daily use of mesmerist tricks can be used to implant any trick the mesmerist knows. Unless specifically noted in the mesmerist trick's description, a mesmerist can't choose a particular trick more than once.",
			"",
			"**Astounding Avoidance** ([Occult Adventures pg. 40](source/occult_adventures)): The subject can avoid damage from magical and unusual attacks. The mesmerist can trigger this trick when the subject attempts a saving throw against an attack or spell that normally deals half damage on a successful save, before the subject rolls the save. If the subject succeeds at her save, she takes no damage. If the mesmerist is 12th level or higher, the subject takes only half damage if she fails her save. The benefits of this trick don't stack with those of the evasion or stalwart class features.",
			"",
			"**Break Stupor** ([Blood of the Beast pg. 18](source/blood_of_the_beast)): The mesmerist can trigger this trick whenever the subject is under an effect such as the fascinated condition or magical slumber as per the sleep spell that would be ended by the subject taking damage or by an obvious threat. The trick sends a momentary phantom threat and sensation of pain, ending the effect. This ability works fast enough to prevent a sleeping creature from falling prone or dropping what it is holding, if the mesmerist uses it immediately. The mesmerist can also trigger the trick if the subject becomes confused as per confusion, but if he does so, the subject attacks the mesmerist on its next turn, as if the mesmerist attacked the subject.",
			"",
			"**Chain of Eyes** ([Occult Origins pg. 12](source/occult_origins)): The subject can share her senses with the mesmerist. The mesmerist triggers chain of eyes by closing his eyes and concentrating on the implanted subject, allowing the mesmerist to see and hear everything the target experiences with her own senses of sight and hearing (including any special senses or magical effects). Once triggered, chain of eyes lasts for 1 minute per mesmerist level or until the mesmerist shifts his field of vision back to himself as a free action. While viewing events from the target's perspective, the mesmerist is flat-footed, even if he can see himself from another perspective.",
			"",
			"**Compel Alacrity** ([Occult Adventures pg. 40](source/occult_adventures)): A dash of mental speed lets the subject push past her physical limits to avoid an enemy. The mesmerist can trigger this trick when the subject begins her turn within an enemy's reach. The subject can move 10 feet as a free action without provoking attacks of opportunity. The distance the subject can move increases by 5 feet for every 5 levels the mesmerist possesses, to a maximum of 30 feet at 20th level. The subject can't move farther than her speed in this way. The movement from this trick doesn't count against the subject's movement speed for that round.",
			"",
			"**Enchanting Words** ([Blood of the Beast pg. 18](source/blood_of_the_beast)): The mesmerist can trigger this trick whenever the subject attempts a Diplomacy or Intimidate check to adjust a creature's attitude. The subject can use the mesmerist's Charisma modifier instead of her own Charisma modifier on the check. If the subject uses Intimidate, the adjustment in attitude lasts an additional number of minutes equal to 10 &times; the mesmerist's Charisma modifier (minimum of 10 additional minutes).",
			"",
			"**False Flanker** ([Occult Adventures pg. 40](source/occult_adventures)): A duplicate of the mesmerist appears momentarily, as though he were fighting in tandem with the subject. The mesmerist can trigger this trick when the subject moves into or begins her turn in a square where she threatens an enemy. An illusory duplicate of the mesmerist appears in any unoccupied space adjacent to that enemy. This duplicate counts as threatening the enemy for the purposes of determining flanking, but can't actually make attacks. The duplicate disappears at the end of the turn during which the trick is triggered. This is an illusion (figment) effect, and a creature that interacts with the false flanker can attempt a saving throw to disbelieve the effect.",
			"",
			"**Fearsome Guise** ([Occult Adventures pg. 40](source/occult_adventures)): A veil of illusion makes the subject appear to be someone else and then transform into a hideous monster at an opportune time. While this trick is implanted, the subject's appearance is altered, as {spell/disguise self}. The mesmerist can trigger this trick when the subject attacks a creature. The illusory appearance briefly makes the subject appear monstrous, then ends. The mesmerist attempts an Intimidate check to demoralize the target of the triggering attack. The restrictions on attempts to demoralize a target (the target being within 30 feet and able to see and hear the creature attempting the Intimidate check) apply to the subject of the trick. This is an illusion (glamer) effect.",
			"",
			"**Fleet in Shadows** ([Occult Realms pg. 16](source/occult_realms)): The mesmerist can trigger this trick whenever the target enters an area with dim or darker light. The subject can move double its normal speed (up to an additional 30 feet) for 1 round, but only while moving through areas of dim or darker light. Additionally, the subject can move at its normal speed and use the bonus speed from this trick in areas of total darkness, even if it cannot see.",
			"",
			"**Gift of Will** ([Occult Adventures pg. 40](source/occult_adventures)): A small portion of the mesmerist's vast mental power buttresses his ally's mind. The mesmerist can trigger this trick when the subject attempts a Will saving throw or a Sense Motive check, or is targeted by an Intimidate check to demoralize her. For a saving throw, the subject uses the mesmerist's Will saving throw bonus instead of her own. For a Sense Motive check or Intimidate check, she adds the mesmerist's Charisma bonus as a morale bonus on the check or to the DC. The mesmerist can't implant this trick on himself.",
			"",
			"**Levitation Buffer** ([Occult Adventures pg. 41](source/occult_adventures)): A mesmerist's telekinetic assault renders foes around the subject less of a threat. The mesmerist can trigger this trick when either an enemy moves adjacent to the subject or the subject begins her turn with one or more enemies adjacent to her. The mesmerist can either lift all enemies adjacent to the subject slightly into the air or push them all away from the subject. Lifting enemies causes them to move at half speed and take a -4 penalty to their CMDs against bull rush, drag, and reposition attempts for 1 round (Will negates). The speed reduction and CMD penalty don't stack with those from hostile levitation. Pushing enemies away requires the mesmerist to attempt a bull rush combat maneuver check using his mesmerist level + his Charisma modifier as his CMB. Any enemy that's successfully pushed moves away from the subject of the trick using the normal rules for a bull rush.",
			"",
			"**Life Revier** ([Blood of the Beast pg. 19](source/blood_of_the_beast)): The mesmerist can trigger this trick when the subject attempts an Intelligence or Knowledge check to remember a previous experience. The subject receives flashes of her entire life up to this point. She can use the mesmerist's Charisma modifier in place of her Intelligence modifier on the check, and she can attempt the check untrained. The subject cannot learn information that she has not previously read, heard, or otherwise experienced at some point during her life when using this ability.",
			"",
			"**Linked Reaction** ([Occult Adventures pg. 41](source/occult_adventures)): A hive mind allows the mesmerist and an ally to share one another's reaction times. The mesmerist can trigger this trick when either the subject or the mesmerist is surprised and the other isn't (even if the mesmerist would normally be unable to take actions because of being surprised). Both the mesmerist and the subject can act in this surprise round. The mesmerist can't implant this trick on himself.",
			"",
			"**Mask Misery** ([Occult Adventures pg. 41](source/occult_adventures)): The subject can shrug off a condition for a short time before succumbing to it. The mesmerist can trigger this trick when the subject becomes affected by a minor condition listed under the touch treatment ability. The subject can ignore the effect of that condition for 1d4 rounds, after which the subject takes the full effect. This has no effect on any conditions affecting the subject other than the triggering condition, even if those other effects are also listed under touch treatment. The rounds during which the subject ignores the triggering effect still count against that effect's duration; if the duration of mask misery is longer than the effect lasts, the subject isn't affected by the condition at all. If an effect that imposes more than one condition triggers this trick, the subject ignores all eligible conditions. If the mesmerist is 6th level or higher, he adds the moderate conditions to the conditions he can ignore with this trick, and this trick ends minor conditions entirely instead of suppressing them temporarily. The mesmerist doesn't need to have touch treatment to choose or use this trick.",
			"",
			"**Meek Facade** ([Occult Adventures pg. 41](source/occult_adventures)): The subject magically seems like a weak target, goading an enemy into attacking her. The mesmerist can trigger this trick when the subject misses a creature with an attack (even if it's part of a full attack in which she hits that creature with another attack). The enemy must attack no one other than the subject, and the subject gains a +2 dodge bonus to AC against the triggering enemy's attacks. Both of these effects last for 1 round. The bonus to AC increases by 1 for every 5 levels the mesmerist possesses. This is a mind-affecting compulsion effect.",
			"",
			"**Mesmeric Mirror** ([Occult Adventures pg. 41](source/occult_adventures)): An illusory image appears near the subject to throw off attackers. The mesmerist can trigger this trick when the subject is attacked or becomes the target of a spell that requires an attack roll. One duplicate of the subject appears, and the attacker must determine randomly which it hits (as {spell/mirror image}). For every 5 class levels the mesmerist possesses, one additional image appears, to a maximum of five images at 20th level. Each image lasts for 1 minute per mesmerist level or until destroyed. This is an illusion (figment) effect.",
			"",
			"**Mesmeric Pantomime** ([Occult Adventures pg. 41](source/occult_adventures)): By orchestrating the movement of his ally's body, the mesmerist imparts to that ally his own skill at a physical task. The mesmerist can trigger this trick when the subject attempts a Strength- or Dexterity-based skill check. The subject either uses the mesmerist's bonus on the skill check in place of her own or gains a morale bonus on the check equal to the mesmerist's Charisma bonus, whichever results in a higher modifier. The mesmerist can't implant this trick on himself.",
			"",
			"**Misdirection** ([Occult Adventures pg. 41](source/occult_adventures)): An enemy's perception of an attack by the subject shifts, making the foe unprepared to defend against the attack. The mesmerist can trigger this trick when the subject makes an attack or uses a spell that requires an attack roll. The mesmerist attempts a Bluff check to feint against a single target of the subject's attack. Unlike a normal feint, this ability can be used on non-melee attacks. If the feint succeeds, the target of the attack is denied its Dexterity bonus to AC against the triggering attack. The target doesn't suffer any additional effects that the mesmerist or the subject would cause on a normal feint or Bluff check. This is an illusion (glamer) effect.",
			"",
			"**Psychic Impression** ([Heroes of Golarion pg. 9](source/heroes_of_golarion)): Objects retain psychic impressions of those who come in contact with them, and a powerful mind can read these impressions. The mesmerist can trigger this trick when the subject touches an object that another creature with an Intelligence score of 3 or more has touched in the last 10 minutes. The mesmerist receives a psychic impression of the emotional state of the last such creature to touch the object. This impression contains no images or languages and can't show the mesmerist who the creature was if the mesmerist doesn't already know.",
			"",
			"**Psychosomatic Surge** ([Occult Adventures pg. 41](source/occult_adventures)): Psychic magic soothes the subject, alleviating her wounds temporarily. The mesmerist can trigger this trick when the subject takes damage. The subject gains a number of temporary hit points equal to 1d8 + 1/2 the mesmerist's level. If the damage from the triggering attack would have reduced the subject to 0 hit points or fewer, this trick grants an additional 1d8 temporary hit points. These temporary hit points last for 1 hour or until discharged.",
			"",
			"**Reflect Fear** ([Occult Realms pg. 16](source/occult_realms)): The mesmerist can trigger this trick when the subject is affected by a fear effect or is the target of an Intimidate check to demoralize it. When the trick is triggered, the subject suppresses the fear effect that triggered the trick for 1d4 rounds, and any creature that caused this effect must succeed at a Will save or become shaken for 1 round. The rounds during which the subject ignores the triggering fear effect still count against the effect's duration. If the duration of the reflect fear trick is longer than the fear effect lasts, the subject isn't affected by the fear effect at all.",
			"",
			"**Reflection of Weakness** ([Occult Adventures pg. 41](source/occult_adventures)): Psychic feedback causes an enemy to suffer from the same weakening effect it imposes on the subject. The mesmerist can trigger this trick when an attack or spell used by an enemy causes the subject to take ability damage, ability drain, bleed damage, or a minor or moderate condition listed under the touch treatment class feature. If the trick is triggered by ability damage, ability drain, or bleed damage, the amount of damage or drain the subject takes is reduced by 2 points (to a minimum of 0 points), and the creature that made the attack or cast the spell takes 2 points of ability damage to an ability score of the mesmerist's choice. The monster can attempt a Will save to negate the ability damage. This ability can be used if the attacker inflicts a curse, disease, or poison that deals ability damage or drain, but only if it deals that damage immediately, with no onset time. If the trick is triggered by the subject gaining a condition, the subject is still affected by the condition, but the attacker takes a condition of the mesmerist's choice for 1 round. This condition must come from the minor condition or moderate condition lists of the touch treatment class feature. The enemy can attempt a Will save to avoid gaining the condition. The mesmerist doesn't need to have touch treatment to select or use this trick.",

			"**See in Darkness** ([Occult Realms pg. 16](source/occult_realms)): The subject gains darkvision with a range of 60 feet for 1 minute. The mesmerist can trigger this trick when the subject moves into an area of darkness.",
			"",
			"**Shadow Splinter** ([Occult Adventures pg. 42](source/occult_adventures)): The mesmerist protects the subject against an attack and redirects the harm to someone else. The mesmerist can trigger this trick when the subject takes damage from an attack. The damage the subject takes is reduced by an amount equal to 3 + the mesmerist's Charisma modifier (to a maximum of the total amount of damage the attack deals). Another creature within range of the original attack, other than the attacker, is affected by a shadow illusion that makes it appear as if the attacker is attacking that creature instead of the attacker's actual target. This second creature takes an amount of damage equal to the amount by which the attack's damage was reduced. This shadow doesn't require a roll to hit and ignores cover and concealment, but the target can attempt a Will save to disbelieve the effect. If it succeeds at this save, it neither takes the damage nor believes the attacker targeted it. This trick can't be triggered if there's no eligible second creature within range to take the redirected damage. This is an illusion (shadow) effect.",
			"",
			"**Slip Bonds** ([Occult Origins pg. 12](source/occult_origins)): While implanted with this trick, the subject gains a +2 circumstance bonus on Escape Artist checks. If the subject becomes grappled, pinned, shackled, or otherwise personally restrained, the mesmerist can trigger the trick and cause the subject to become incorporeal just long enough to slip her bonds (unless they can otherwise restrain an incorporeal creature). This effect doesn't last long enough for the subject to move through walls or other barriers. If the mesmerist is 12th level, the subject remains incorporeal until the beginning of the mesmerist's next turn.",
			"",
			"**Spectral Smoke** ([Occult Adventures pg. 42](source/occult_adventures)): A cloud of smoke pops up around the subject, foiling attacks. The mesmerist can trigger this trick when the subject is targeted by an attack or by a spell that requires an attack roll. A smoke cloud appears in the subject's square and in a 10-foot radius around it. This cloud lasts for 1 round per mesmerist level. The cloud functions as {spell/fog cloud}, but is an illusion (figment) effect that can't be dispersed by wind and can be used underwater. A creature that interacts with the cloud can attempt a saving throw to disbelieve the effect. The radius of the cloud increases by 5 feet for every 5 caster levels the mesmerist possesses, to a maximum of 30 feet at 20th level.",
			"",
			"**Telepathic Link** ([Heroes of Golarion pg. 9](source/heroes_of_golarion)): The subject can communicate telepathically with the mesmerist during a crisis. The mesmerist can trigger this trick when the subject and her allies are outnumbered in combat. For 1 minute per mesmerist level, the subject and the mesmerist can communicate telepathically. If the subject and the mesmerist are more than a medium distance (100 feet + 10 feet per level) apart, the telepathic connection is severed and cannot be regained unless the trick is implanted again. The mesmerist and the subject must share a language to be able to communicate.",
			"",
			"**Umbral Shield** ([Occult Realms pg. 16](source/occult_realms)): The subject ignores any harmful effects of bright light or sunlight for 1 minute. The mesmerist can trigger this trick whenever the subject would be exposed to harmful bright light (such as sunlight is to a vampire). The subject is immune to the dazzled condition while this trick is in effect.",
			"",
			"**Unwitting Messenger** ([Occult Origins pg. 12](source/occult_origins)): The mesmerist describes a recipient to the subject while implanting this trick, then recites a verbal message no longer than five words per mesmerist level. The subject of unwitting messenger has no memory of the message or the target recipient. When the subject encounters the specified recipient, she repeats the message verbatim, but does not recall speaking the message or its contents. The message remains buried in the subject's subconscious for 24 hours, after which time it disappears if not delivered. The subject of unwitting messenger can be fooled by mundane disguises or illusions, causing her to deliver the message to the wrong recipient.",
			"",
			"**Vanish Arrow** ([Occult Adventures pg. 42](source/occult_adventures)): With a flourish, the mesmerist snatches a projectile from an enemy before it can be shot. The mesmerist can trigger this trick when the subject is targeted by a ranged weapon attack, before the attack roll is made. The mesmerist attempts a Sleight of Hand check opposed by the attacker's Perception check. If the mesmerist succeeds, that ranged attack automatically misses, and the projectile appears stowed on the mesmerist's person. If the attacker is making a full attack, this affects only one of the attacks (of the mesmerist's choice). If the attack is made with a javelin or other thrown weapon, the attacker gains a +4 bonus on its Perception check. Unusually massive ranged weapons (such as boulders or ballista bolts) and ranged attacks generated by natural attacks or spell effects are not affected by this ability.",
			"",
			"**Voice of Reason** ([Heroes of Golarion pg. 9](source/heroes_of_golarion)): The subject can more easily pierce sight-based illusions with the mesmerist's aid. The mesmerist can trigger this trick when the subject attempts a saving throw to disbelieve a sight-based illusion effect, but only so long as the mesmerist is not affected by or has disbelieved the illusion himself. The subject receives an insight bonus on her saving throw to disbelieve the illusion equal to the mesmerist's Charisma modifier. This trick cannot be used for illusions that do not allow a saving throw."

			"Witch patrons are enigmatic entities, sometimes fair minded and other times malevolent. Some are demigods or powerful spirits, such as those that grant shamans their spellcasting. Others are manifestations of cosmic forces, created by the certainty of mortals and the fundamental need for balance in much the same way aeons manifest. While kindly patrons are rare - attracting worshipers more readily than agents - the majority are high-minded and neutral figures. They dispense arcane power to those whose interests and mindsets align with their needs, and once a witch drifts from the cause or refuses to pay the price for such power, her patron divests the spellcaster of her powers and departs. Wicked patrons enjoy longer-lasting relationships, however, manipulating the witches' minds and punishing disobedience in a manner far more personal than an evil god. The familiar of a wicked patron becomes equal parts power source and prison guard, forever studying its charge for disobedience.",
			"",
			"The various published witch patron themes present a wide array of concepts and priorities to align with a large variety of supernatural beings. Some specific patrons, however, might offer variations within the spells they grant. Special patrons swap out the spells normally provided by a patron theme at specific levels, and grant a specific hex and drawback at 1st level. Once a specific patron has been selected, a witch cannot change her patron or raise a hand against that entity without losing her spellcasting, hexes, and familiar. These categories are limited in the patron themes they can provide; their witches must select from one of the four listed for each entry. These patrons are extraordinary examples of their kind, often invested with unique or mythic powers and pursuing long-term agendas measured in centuries or eons.",

			"",
			"An iconic ability of clerics is their power to channel positive or negative energy, whether for healing, for damage, or to turn or command the undead. However, given the great variety of deities and their divine portfolios, it naturally follows that some deities would endow their mortal servants with the power to channel energies in other ways that more closely mirror their particular focus. The following categories are examples of alternative channeling abilities based on the nature of a deity's power; for example, a fire deity's negative energy channeling may deal fire damage as part of or instead of the damage from channeling.",
			"",
			"When you create a cleric character, decide whether she uses the standard form of channel energy or a variant presented here based on one aspect of her deity's portfolio. Once this choice is made, it cannot be altered. Variant channeling has the same area of effect, save DCs, uses per day, and other rules relating to channeling energy. Feats and abilities that modify or present alternative uses for channeled energy (such as Command Undead and Turn Undead) work normally with these variant channeling abilities.",
			"",
			"A variant channeling either modifies positive channeled energy when used to heal or modifies negative energy when used to harm. When using positive energy to heal, affected creatures gain only half the normal amount of healing but also receive a specific beneficial effect. When channeling negative energy to harm, affected creatures take only half the normal damage but take an additional penalty or harmful effect; a successful saving throw negates the additional penalty or effect but does not reduce the damage any further. Creatures that would normally ignore the effect of a particular channel (such as undead with respect to a positive energy channel used to heal) ignore the variant effect of that channel.",
			"",
			"Some variant channeling abilities are enhanced when used on particular creature types. Such channeling increases the normal healing or damage from channeled energy by 50% for that creature type, rather than the default half healing or damage for the alternative channeling. For example, a 7th-level cleric normally heals 4d6 points of damage with channeled positive energy; with the Nature alternative channeling, that cleric instead heals only half that amount (2d6) when channeling, but heals animals and fey an additional +50% over the unhalved value (4d6 + 50%).",
			"",
			"Unless otherwise stated, bonuses granted by a variant channeling are sacred bonuses if you channel positive energy or profane bonuses if you channel negative energy. If an alternative channeled energy provides a \"channel bonus\" on rolls or statistics, the bonus is +1, increasing to +2 at cleric level 5 and for every 5 cleric levels thereafter (to a maximum of +5). Likewise, a \"channel penalty\" is initially -1, increasing to -2 at cleric level 5 and every 5 cleric levels thereafter (to a maximum of -5).",
			"",
			"A character who has the channel energy ability from a class other than cleric may use these variant channeling rules if the class's abilities are tied to serving a deity. For example, paladins can select alternative channeling abilities if they serve a deity, as can oracles with the Life mystery (as they serve many deities), but necromancer wizards cannot.",

			"",
			"**Sweeping Strike (Ex)** ([Antihero's Handbook pg. 16](source/antiheros_handbook)): The vigilante gains {feat/Cleave} as a bonus feat. At 6th level, he gains {feat/Great Cleave} as a bonus feat.

			"## Monk Vows",
			"",
			"A monk can discipline his body to hold more ki by upholding the strict tenets of a vow. By adhering to his vow's tenets, the monk's ki pool increases by the amount listed in the vow's description. Every vow comes with a penalty or limitation to offset this increase in ki. A monk can take a vow at any level, but it does not add to his ki pool until he gains a ki pool as a class feature. A monk who takes a vow never gains the still mind class feature, even if he abandons all his vows.",
			"",
			"If a monk knowingly and willingly breaks his vow, his ki pool is reduced to 0 (as if he had spent all of his ki points) and he cannot replenish his pool or use abilities that require ki or a ki pool until he has redeemed himself. Redemption requires a recommitment to his vow accompanied by an atonement spell. After the redemption, the monk's normal ki pool (without the bonus from the vow) returns. If he upholds the previously broken vow for a full month, his ki pool regains the additional points from taking the vow, and he can decide whether to continue with his vow or forgo his vow without penalty. Once a monk forgoes a vow in this fashion, she can never gain a ki point bonus from that vow.",
			"",
			"A monk may have multiple vows. Their effects and increase to his ki pool stack. If a monk violates a vow, he suffers the loss of ki described above; redemption means the monk regains the extra ki from his unbroken vows, but the extra ki from the broken vow does not return until he finishes the month-long commitment (in effect, violating one vow does not have an effect on the other vows once the monk redeems himself).",
			"",
			"**Celibacy** ([Ultimate Magic pg. 50](source/ultimate_magic)) The monk must abstain from all sexual and intimate physical activity. A monk with this vow takes it to an extreme, refusing to even share a room with another person, or sleeping on the opposite side of a camp from other people in a group. A celibate monk is not allowed to touch others or have others touch him (including touch spells from allies). Striking enemies in battle or being struck by enemies is not prohibited, but the monk shuns all peaceful or pleasurable contact. A monk with this vow increases his ki pool by 1 ki point for every 5 monk levels (minimum +1).",
			"",
			"**Chains** ([Ultimate Magic pg. 50](source/ultimate_magic)) Either out of penitence or to bring attention to the suffering of the enslaved, the monk wears shackles on his wrists and legs. This gives the monk a -1 penalty on attack rolls and to AC, and reduces his movement by 10 feet. If temporarily unable to wear his chains, he may carry rocks or some other heavy burden (including medium or heavy armor) to simulate this suffering. A monk with this vow increasing his ki pool by 1 ki point for every 3 monk levels (minimum +1).",
			"",
			"**Cleanliness** ([Ultimate Magic pg. 50](source/ultimate_magic)) A monk undertaking this vow must wash daily. He must change into fresh clothes daily or shortly after his robes become dirty. His appearance must be kept immaculate, including either neatly braiding or shaving off his hair (and, for male monks, maintaining a clean-shaven face). His vow forbids him from willingly touching the filthy, diseased, dead, or undead (though he may attempt to cleanse or heal those suffering from disease), though using manufactured weapons to attack these creatures is allowed. A monk with this vow increases his ki pool by 1 ki point for every 5 monk levels (minimum +1).",
			"",
			"**Fasting** ([Ultimate Magic pg. 50](source/ultimate_magic)) The monk eats nothing but rice (or a similar bland, staple food) and drinks nothing but water. On certain days (usually once per month or on a religious holiday), he may eat a small portion of other simple, bland food to maintain proper nutrition. The monk cannot use tobacco, drugs, potions, alchemical items requiring eating or drinking, or any other thing that could be considered a food or beverage. A monk with this vow increases his ki pool by 1 ki point for every 6 monk levels (minimum +1).",
			"",
			"**Peace** ([Ultimate Magic pg. 50](source/ultimate_magic)) The monk must strive to attain peace and may only use violence as a last resort. He can never strike the first blow in combat. If attacked, he must use the fight defensively action or the total defense action for the first 2 rounds. He must always give his opponent the option to surrender, and cannot purposely slay another creature that could reasonably be influenced to flee or join a civilized society as a productive member (obviously this excludes many monsters). Many monks who have taken this vow learn how to grapple and pin opponents, tying them with specialized knots that allow them to work themselves free after sufficient effort. Many monks of peace are vegetarians. A monk with this vow increases his ki pool by 1 ki point for every 5 monk levels (minimum +1).",
			"",
			"**Poverty** ([Ultimate Magic pg. 50](source/ultimate_magic)) The monk taking a vow of poverty must never own more than six possessions - a simple set of clothing, a pair of sandals or shoes, a bowl, a sack, a blanket, and any one other item. Five of these items must be of plain and simple make, though one can be of some value (often an heirloom of great personal significance to the monk). The monk can never keep more money or wealth on his person than he needs to feed, bathe, and shelter himself for 1 week in modest accommodations. He cannot borrow or carry wealth or items worth more than 50 gp that belong to others. He is allowed to accept and use curative potions (or similar magical items where the item is consumed and is valueless thereafter) from other creatures. A monk with this vow increases his ki pool by 1 ki point for every 2 monk levels (minimum +1).",
			"",
			"**Silence** ([Ultimate Magic pg. 51](source/ultimate_magic)) The monk must speak no words and attempt to be quiet in his actions. Accidental noises and the sounds of battle (such as the sound of a fist or weapon striking an opponent) do not affect his vow, though most monks with this vow choose their weapons and opponents so as to minimize even these sounds. The monk is allowed to make a non-vocal noise to warn another of danger (such as by stomping or clapping). The monk is allowed to use gestures and motions to communicate with others (including sign language) and is allowed to write. A monk with this vow increases his ki pool by 1 ki point for every 6 monk levels (minimum +1).",
			"",
			"**Truth** ([Ultimate Magic pg. 51](source/ultimate_magic)) The monk is not allowed to deliberately speak any lies, including bluffing, stating half-truths with the intent to deceive, exaggerating, telling white lies, and so on. This applies to all forms of communication. If presented with circumstances where telling the truth would bring harm to another, the monk remains silent. Many monks of this vow also take a vow of silence to show their commitment. A monk with this vow increases his ki pool by 1 ki point for every 5 monk levels (minimum +1)."

Whenever a character with the animal focus class feature is within 100 feet per class level of one of the wards listed below, she can use the associated ward aspect instead of one of the normal options for her animal focus class feature. Hunters can apply the benefits of a ward aspect to themselves, but not to their animal companions.",

A character attuned to a ward can use the associated ward aspect while within 1 mile per class level. A character can be attuned to only one ward at a time, but depending on her surroundings, she could choose from among multiple wards. A character with the second animal focus class feature can still only use one ward aspect at a time, no matter how many aspects she has available to her.",
