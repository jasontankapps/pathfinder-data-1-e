				"In its natural form, a figurine of the concealed companion looks like nothing more than a fist-sized hunk of distinctly colored clay. When taken up by a character who possesses a deep contention with another creature and brought into contact with that companion creature, the creature vanishes and the clay transforms into a miniature replica of the creature sculpted from colored stone. Only creatures bound to a character via the animal companion, familiar, or mount class feature can be affected by a figurine of the concealed companion. Once a character has bound a creature to the figurine, he can toss down the figurine and speak a command word, causing the creature to return to its natural state and size. At any time while the creature is in its natural form, the creature's owner can speak the figurine's command word and cause the creature to transform back into a miniature. While in figurine form, a creature does not age, perceive the passage of time, or need to breathe, eat, or drink, and can be kept in this form indefinitely. If the creature bound to the figurine is killed, the figurine of the concealed companion returns to its unshaped, clay form and can be bonded to another creature."

Plucked clusters have no powers of their own, but inserting a cluster into one of the six holes in the cubic spiral as a standard action activates one of the artifact's functions.

Through powerful magic, the Lirgeni took her entire hoard to fill their already overflowing coffers. For a while, Abenatrex remained oblivious to the immense slight, but inevitably, one of the wizards made a mistake and their ruse was revealed.

				"The spear of shards is a +6 returning wounding spear created by the Vault Keepers to guide them through the convoluted passages between Golarion's Vaults and to keep dangerous subterranean creatures at bay. The large crystal composing the spear's head is mounted on a 5-foot shaft of lightweight metal that swirls with a complex pattern that every so often appears to shift. A ring designed to fit a dozen smaller teardrop-shaped crystals connects the base of the spear's head to the shaft, although only seven of the 12 sockets contain a crystal. Each of these smaller crystals is about an inch long and angles slightly outward on one side of the ring to act like barbs when the spear is lodged deeply in flesh. Each of these crystals pulses with a warm amber light. Any xiomorn within 1 mile of the spear of shards is automatically aware of its presence, as well as the distance and direction to the artifact.",
				"",
				"Each of the smaller crystals is attuned to a different Vault beneath Golarion. When the wielder of the spear of shards rhythmically taps one of these smaller crystals as a full-round action, the spear identifies the path to the attuned Vault and can direct its wielder unerringly to the Vault, as per find the path. This effect lasts until the spear reaches the attuned Vault or until the crystal at the head of the spear is tapped in the same manner. The five missing crystals are lost but, if rediscovered, could be attached to the spear of shards and reveal the way to their attuned Vaults as well.",
				"",
				"The spear of shards has sufficient intelligence to remain staunchly loyal to its xiomorn creators. If wielded by a non-xiomorn, it either refuses to provide directions or intentionally provides erroneous directions to keep the wielder away from the Vaults. If used by a nonxiomorn in combat, the spear of shards damages the wielder rather than the target on any attack roll that is a natural 1, as a cursed backbiter spear. When the spear of shards is used by a non-xiomorn in combat against a xiomorn, any attack roll other than a natural 20 results in an attack against the wielder instead. A non-xiomorn can use the Use Magic Device skill to emulate a xiomorn and trick the spear of shards, but the DC of this check is increased by 10 (to DC 35) to reflect the spear's suspicion."

This ability is in most other ways identical to the spontaneous casting of clerics and druids (see the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook), but may also be employed by antipaladins, inquisitors, oracles, or other divine casters faithful to Ydersius. The throne bestows one permanent negative level on any creature that sits upon it, other than divine casters who worship Ydersius. This negative level remains as long as the non-sentient or heretical creature sits upon the throne and disappears when the throne is vacated. This negative level cannot be overcome in any way (including by restoration spells) while the throne is occupied."

Worse, the affront allows the totem of Angazhan to attempt once per round to revoke that Gorilla King's reincarnated body.

A wheel of worlds appears as a spherical astrolabe the size of a human skull. Rings of bronze, dark adamantine, and steel form a shifting shell, and as each band moves it reveals another below. These rings bear spidery symbols, marking and measuring the location of celestial bodies. Many researchers who obsess over these devices claim that within their shells lies the truth of the heavens and beyond.

The user can then either travel to that plane or call through a creature native to that realm. Doing either immediately closes the gate.

Every attempt to manipulate the artifact to reach a specific plane (whether successful or not) increases this chance by 3%. When the Wheel of Worlds unexpectedly opens to Hell, the wielder is given a wrong impression of the plane beyond, believing the gate has opened to the expected plane (or to a different layer of Hell, if Hell was the expected plane) rather than to the actual layer of Hell.

The staff tends to right itself if left alone, balancing easily on its lower end, easily moved or toppled but quickly returning to its upright position if left undisturbed for a few minutes. Though the creator of this item is uncertain, most believe it has some ties to Canzoriant, a powerful devil whose cult gained some renown by elves before the Age of Darkness (and who was crushed by Asmodeus in a failed coup). Canzoriant had an interest in conquest and breeding stronger slaves, and it is likely he played a role in its most famous work-the hobgoblin.",

These new goblins were smarter, larger, and stronger than regular goblins, more disciplined, and fearsome, conditioned to hate elves with stories of horror and rumors that the elves reciprocated their hate and wanted the colonies razed. Alert to the hobgoblin threat, the elves located the artifact at the center of the colony and stole it; when the owners caught up to the elves, they battled, and in the confusion the artifact was lost. Since that time the hobgoblins have been their own masters and the names of the being or beings who thought up their creation have been lost. Over the centuries the staff has appeared, usually in the hands of someone wanting to create a new slave race (such as the supposedly-extinct zhug, born of hafling stock) or to inflict a particularly cruel punishment on an enemy (such as when Bandit King Anfax used it to transform his enemy's army into catfish in the middle of a hot summer battle), and the Three Generations War in the River Kingdoms resulted in it changing hands at least four times between opposing parties.",

With the proper command word, once per day you can use it to cast a mass polymorph or baleful polymorph, though there reputedly is a very small chance that the staff will transform you as well. You can use it to cast bear's endurance, bull's strength, cat's grace, eagle's splendor, fox's cunning, or owl's wisdom up to 10 times per day in any combination, or use five of the daily \"charges\" of this power to cast a mass version of any of those spells.",

A few minutes later water begins to bubble up from the earth, forming a pool or spring if the shape of the ground permits it. This water is pure and clean and replenishes itself at a rate of one gallon per minute. Through an attunement process that takes several days of active concentration (similar to crafting a magic item) you can give the spring magical powers so that any who drink from it will be permanently affected, though there are usually slight side effects (for example, if the water enhances Dexterity, a drinker may gain cat-like features).",
				"",
				"Many stories of magical fountains or springs crystal rests at the bottom and is obscured by plants or sediment, and it is possible that several variant races or subraces owe their existence to this artifact. The power of the spring tends to drift over time, requiring attention at least one day out of every month. Furthermore, the staff has been known to create a spring without its owner commanding it to do so. If the staff is removed from the spring, the water usually loses its magical powers and eventually drains away, though the Bouldertop Oasis in northern Osirion has no natural explanation and has a faint magical aura reminiscent of the Cantorian Spring."

Atop the massive storm cloud, the castle is shaped like a square, with 80-foot guard towers at each corner. At its center is a 140-foot tower with seven levels and more than 30 chambers. The central tower is well appointed with many halls, living chambers, suites, privies, kitchens (with pantries that magically replenish food stores every fortnight), and laboratories suitable for arcane and alchemical study. Each guard tower has living chambers and barracks for up to 25 guards, and one tower has an adjoining stable that can hold up to a dozen griffons, hippogriffs, pegasi, or even terrestrial mounts. In all, the tower can comfortably support a population of 300 Medium creatures.",

If the castle already has a master, that master must be defeated before another can take her place. The castle's movement is controlled by way of a control chamber located at the heart (a central chamber on its 4th floor). There, a font of pure elemental water serves as a scrying device for the castle's master, though it can view only places inside the castle or within 100 feet of it. The master (or a person she designates) can direct the castle's motion from within the chamber. It has a fly speed of 250 feet (clumsy) and uses the Fly skill modifier of the person controlling its motion; the castle can hover without needing to make a Fly check and never risks falling due to a failed check. When not being controlled, the castle moves randomly, sometimes changing direction every minute, sometimes holding the same course for days at a time, but always avoiding the ground or other hazards. It has the ability to travel to other planes, though no master other than the Storm King is known to have invoked this power. The master of the castle gains the following spell-like abilities. ",

Any other attacks may cause walls to collapse or even side towers to break loose, but the central chamber and the floors beneath it will continue to exist in a ruined form over a smaller storm cloud as long as this destruction condition is not met."

				"Approximately 15 feet tall and 15 feet square, this crude hut sits atop a pair of gigantic chicken legs that, when not tucked beneath the structure at rest, endlessly pick and scratch at the hut's surroundings. The life-like legs aren't the only thing that make the hut remarkable, however. The small building's only door opens into a room that can be significantly larger than what the structure can naturally contain, for the hut possesses countless configurations of extradimensional rooms that change depending on the hut's physical location. Nothing that transpires outside the hut has any effect on those inside. The properties and abilities of the Dancing Hut are divided into two categories: the defensive and the transportive.",
				"",
				"Defensive: At its most basic level, the Dancing Hut is a unique CR 17 construct. The statistics and abilities of this remarkable creation are detailed below. A creature inside the hut can command the structure to move, attack, use its special abilities, or immediately perform any other function it is capable of by employing the Dancing Hut's unusual controls, which consist of a brown hen's egg inside a simple, cracked clay bowl sitting upon a table inside the hut. Both the bowl and egg can easily be removed or destroyed, but both reappear 1 hour later and only function within the confines of the hut. Breaking the egg reveals the head of live and very irate rooster that dies a long, squawking death-and disappears an hour later when the controls reform. Any creature that makes a successful DC 30 Use Magic Device check can use these innocuous controls to command the Dancing Hut. Failing this check causes the hut to dance erratically, potentially trampling creatures nearby, but has no effect on creatures inside the hut. A creature must succeed at a new Use Magic Device check every round to directly control the hut's actions. The hut can be assigned simple, standing commands to follow, such as to attack any humanoid that approaches, to patrol an area, to head in a direction for a set period, or to flee if damaged, but cannot be assigned commands that require it to follow multipart instructions, recognize specific individuals, or seek a specific place.",
				"",
				"Transportive: As a construct, the Dancing Hut can physically move on its own, but it also possesses the ability to slip between planes and even travel to other planets, carrying any inside the hut with it. This remarkable ability is activated using the cauldron within the hut, which links the hut to countless-if not infinite-locations across the planes. To use these transportive abilities, a creature must stand before the hut's cauldron, place two ingredients inside, and stir the ever-bubbling stew within-a process requiring a full-round action, though finding the desired ingredients might take longer. The two ingredients act as \"keys\" to a specific destination. Each destination the hut can travel to has a specific combination, or \"recipe,\" of two keys, which appear to be relatively normal items stored throughout the hut itself. Although the keys appear to be absolutely mundane, only those specific items within the hut function as keys. So while a red apple might be one key, it must be the red apple found inside the Dancing Hut, not just any apple. Like the hut's controls, keys can easily be destroyed or removed from the hut, but they reappear 1 hour later. In the Reign of Winter Adventure Path, Queen Elvanna has deactivated the keys within the hut to keep anyone from stealing the hut and taking it away from Golarion. Throughout the campaign, the PCs seek out additional keys hidden by Baba Yaga that enable them to control the hut. Since these additional keys were not present in the hut when Elvanna deactivated them, once brought into the hut, these new keys function exactly as would the keys normally found in the hut, in all cases. At no point during the campaign do any of the deactivated keys function; if placed within the hut's cauldron, they simply disappear and reappear, still deactivated, 1 hour later. Until the PCs rescue Baba Yaga, who can reactivate the keys within the hut, the only way to use the Dancing Hut's transportive abilities is with the extra keys left behind by Baba Yaga.",
				"",
				"Once the proper keys have been placed in the cauldron, the Dancing Hut immediately appears at its new destination, as if it had traveled there via plane shift or interplanetary teleport. The hut always appears in the same location at a given destination-the keys are tied to that specific location. Once at a destination, the Dancing Hut can move (or be moved) normally to any other location on that world or plane. Once the hut arrives at its new destination, the keys immediately disappear from the cauldron, reforming elsewhere in the hut.",
				"",
				"Each time a new combination of keys is used to transport the Dancing Hut to a new location, the interior layout of the hut changes, as each location to which the hut can travel has its own corresponding layout of the hut's interior. As the hut travels, these layouts can change dramatically, though every layout contains one room with a cauldron and the hut's controls, regardless of how many other rooms are present in that layout. Starting with Pathfinder Adventure Path #68, each adventure in the Reign of Winter Adventure Path presents a new layout of the hut, based on the physical location of the hut in that adventure.",
				"",
				"When the Dancing Hut's layout changes, the other layouts still exist, but are inaccessible from within the hut itself. Magic such as plane shift can still be used to visit these otherwise inaccessible layouts, and Baba Yaga herself (as well as certain other residents of the hut) can freely travel throughout all of the rooms of the hut, regardless of the hut's physical location.",

Their runewells are perhaps the most notorious of these artifacts, though others, like the Runeforge, exist. But they learned this technique from the artifacts of those who preceded them. The Everdawn Pool is one such artifact. Unlike magical pools created by the runelords, it needs no well as a container-it is a 30-foot-diameter sphere of roiling, churning blood in which brief glimpses of limbs and faces (not all of them humanoid) constantly form and dissolve.",

What seems certain is that she-and later, other runelords-were able to reverse engineer some of the Everdawn Pool's properties and build pools of power of their own. In many cases, these pools even surpassed the Everdawn Pool. Certainly, the power of [Karzoug's Runewell of Greed](unknown:Karzoug's_Runewell_of_Greed) exceeds that of the Everdawn Pool, as would, one would guess, the runewells created by those more powerful than him (Xanderghul, Alaznist, and Sorshen).

Additional charges can be stored in the Everdawn Pool by performing this ritual multiple times, but only one such ritual can be performed at any one time (effectively limiting the Everdawn Pool's capacity to be recharged to a rate of no more than 2 charges per day).

In Ileosa's case, life created using this power manifests as a [taniniver](unknown:taniniver). Creatures created by other NPCs (or even PCs) should be selected and customized as needed by the GM to represent the source.

Once the user has spent 100 charges in this manner, and as long as all 100 charges were spent within the span of a single year, all of those creatures that provided blood samples drop dead, and for each donor that dies, the user ceases to age for 1 year. Ileosa has infused the Everdawn Pool with blood harvested from thousands of Korvosans, so if she completes this ritual, she'll remain young for thousands of years-more than enough time to repeat the ritual as she needs to extend her effective immortality. This adventure assumes that she is only 10 days (and thus 10 charges) away from completing her ritual when the PCs begin Part 3 of Chapter 6-see page 388 for more details.

The Everdawn Pool can attempt to save against this effect (it has a total Will save bonus of +18 against this specific effect).

Unless otherwise noted, effects caused by the deck are permanent and can only be undone by a miracle or wish spell, the powers of another artifact, or the intervention of a deity. Many of the deck's effects can alter elements of the game world, and thus should be integrated however the GM sees fit, keeping in mind the alignment and intention of each card.",
				"",
				"The Avalanche: The character becomes the focal point of an earthquake, as per the earthquake spell. In addition to saving versus this effect, the character must succeed at an additional Will save or be affected by the spell imprisonment. The Bear: The character gains the lycanthrope template, becoming a werebear. He is considered a natural lycanthrope, and as such, cure disease and heal have no affect on this affliction. The Beating: While in combat, the character is always considered to be flanked. Attackers gain a +2 flanking bonus on attacks made against the character and may sneak attack him at will. The Betrayal: The character's animal companion, familiar, cohort, or other NPC ally is alienated and forever after hostile. If the character has no such allies, the enmity of some powerful personage, community, or religious order can be substituted. This hatred remains a secret until such a time that it might be most dramatically and perilously revealed. Upon drawing this card, the character knows that someone or something will turn against him, but nothing more. The Big Sky: Once per day, the character can add +10 to his CMB or CMD for 1 round. When he does so, a piece of metal in close proximity shatters. The Brass Dwarf: The character becomes immune to one energy type of his choice, but gains vulnerability to another energy type of the GM's choice. The Carnival: Upon drawing The Carnival, the card is set aside and the GM draws nine additional cards from the deck. These cards are laid face up for the character to view, then flipped over and shuffled by the GM. The player draws one card from the nine, taking that card's effects as normal. The Courtesan: The character's favorite item- preferably a magic weapon-becomes intelligent. Use the rules for intelligent items on page 532 of the Core Rulebook to randomly generate the item's abilities. If the character has no items, an intelligent item soon falls into the character's possession. The Cricket: Upon drawing this card, the character may choose to draw up to three additional cards. In addition to those cards' effects, the character's base land speed increases by +10 feet for each card he draws. The Crows: The character must choose between his most valuable item and a major ally of the GM's choice. Whichever is not selected is destroyed or slain and cannot be restored by mortal means. The character is made aware of the ramifications of this choice upon drawing the card. The Cyclone: An elder air elemental appears, and the character must fight it alone. If the character cannot defeat the elemental in 1d6+1 rounds, he is transported to the Plane of Air. The Dance: From this point on, whenever the character rolls initiative, he rolls twice and selects whichever result he prefers. The Demon's Lantern: The character's body disintegrates. All that remains are his items and a glowing gem containing his soul. This gem is worth an amount of gp equal to 2,500 &times; the character's level. A resurrection or stronger spell is required to restore the character, and doing so destroys the gem. The Desert: This card grants the character the one-time ability to travel to any location on the same plane instantly, bringing with him up to 10 allies and 2,000 pounds of goods. The character must know exactly where he wishes to travel, such as a place he has been or a location on a map, but not a vague or hidden location, like the richest dungeon in the world or the Lost City of Ird. This transportation ignores all barriers against teleportation or other magical effects. The character may use this card's effect whenever he wishes, but only once. The Fiend: A powerful evil outsider takes notice of the character and sets plans in motion to destroy him. The Foreign Trader: The mysterious entity known as the Foreign Trader appears and offers the character any treasure he wishes in return for years of his life. If the character accepts, he must choose to age a number of age categories. The character takes all the ability score penalties for his new age, but gains none of the benefits. For each age category he advances, however, he gains 20,000 gp worth of credit with the Foreign Trader, which can be spent on any non-unique magic items. Any credit a character does not spend is lost. After the character is done spending his credit, the Foreign Trader vanishes. Years taken by the Foreign Trader cannot be restored by any means. The Foreign Trader does not trade with characters who cannot die of old age. If the character is immortal, the Foreign Trader vanishes, leaving behind another card. If the character declines to bargain with the Foreign Trader, the trader disappears in a puff of acrid yellow smoke. The Forge: The character must choose one weapon or armor in his possession to be reforged into another weapon or armor of equal or lesser gp value. For example, should a character choose to have a +3 longsword (an 18,315 gp value) reforged, he could have it transformed into any one of hundreds of items, like a +1 axiomatic scimitar (also a 18,315 gp value) or a suit of +3 full-plate of silent moves (12,300 gp). Any gp value not spent is lost. The Eclipse: From the hours of dusk to dawn, the character is treated as being one level lower than normal. If the character has multiple classes, he must decide upon drawing this card which class is affected. The Empty Throne: The character inherits a noble title and 15,000 gp soon after drawing this card. The GM decides the particulars of when and how this occurs. The Hidden Truth: This card grants the character the one-time ability to call upon an omniscient spirit to fully answer any question or solve any single puzzle. Whether the information revealed can be effectively acted upon is another question entirely. The character may use this card's effect whenever he wishes, but only once. The Idiot: The character's Charisma, Intelligence, and Wisdom scores are all reduced by 1d4 points. Roll individually for each ability score. The Inquisitor: This card grants the character the onetime ability to force another creature to answer a single question truthfully. The card does not grant the character or creature questioned any special insight, so a creature might still answer a question falsely if it believes the falsehood. If the creature is truly ignorant, it informs the character that it doesn't know the answer and this effect is wasted. The character may use this card's effect whenever he wishes, but only once. The Joke: Upon drawing this card, the character selects one of his allies. Three new cards are then drawn by the GM and made visible (the GM may choose whether or not to explain the cards' effects). The character's ally must choose one of these cards and immediately gains the effects. The character then selects one of the remaining two cards and gains that card's effects. The final card is discarded. The Juggler: The character gains a +2 bonus to two ability scores of his choice, but must swap them with one another. The Keep: The character gains a personal demiplane, as per a permanent create demiplane spell. The Liar: The character's most powerful, most valuable, or favorite magic item (GM's choice) manifests a curse. Roll on Table 15-27: Common Item Curses on page 537 of the Core Rulebook to generate this effect, rerolling results for specific items. The Locksmith: This card grants the character the ability to open any one door, lock, set of bindings, or other locked barrier. This includes magical gates or portals that have specific requirements to activate. The character may use this card's effect whenever he wishes, but only once. Once used, the card's effect ends. The Lost: The character cannot gain another level in whichever class he currently has the most levels. This effect can be circumvented if the character is killed and returned to life, but the next time he is restored to life he is affected as if by the spell reincarnate, regardless of what spell was cast. The Marriage: A comely genie of the character's preferred gender appears and proposes marriage. Should the character accept, he must organize a lavish wedding ceremony by the end of the week and ever after be committed to this exotic outsider. If the character declines or breaks his wedding vow, the genie is heartbroken and returns to his or her home plane, provoking the ire of the associated elemental court. The genie's type, personality, actions, and possible retribution are determined by the GM. The Midwife: The character gains exactly enough experience to advance to the next level. The Mountain Man: The character grows one size category, gaining all the benefits and penalties of increased size. His equipment does not increase in size. The Mute Hag: The character permanently loses one of his senses-sight, hearing, or speech-becoming blind, deaf, or mute (player's choice). This affliction cannot be cured by any effect short of a miracle or wish spell. The Owl: This card grants the character the one-time ability to scry on any target anywhere for 1 minute. The target, however, is immediately aware that it is being scryed upon by the character. The character may use this card's effect whenever he wishes, but only once. Once used, the card's effect ends. The Paladin: The character is granted a holy avenger. This weapon has all the properties of a normal holy avenger, along with a special ability that can be used once. Upon being thrust into the ground by its bearer as a standard action, the weapon transforms into a paladin two levels higher than the wielder. This paladin possesses her own holy avenger and aids the character in any way her alignment permits for 30 minutes. Once this time is over, the paladin vanishes and the sword reappears, though it is forever reduced to a +2 cold iron longsword. The Peacock: The character's skin hardens, becoming rigid and pebbled. He gains a permanent +2 bonus to his natural armor, but takes a -2 penalty to Dexterity. The Publican: The GM chooses one of the character's enemies. This enemy has a complete change of heart and now favors the character. The Queen Mother: When the character draws this card, 2d4 giant ants appear to serve the character until they are slain. These creatures eagerly seek to aid and protect the character. They understand the character's verbal commands, though they cannot respond. The Rabbit Prince: All attacks the character makes that threaten a critical hit are automatically confirmed. Likewise, all attacks made against the character that threaten a critical hit are also automatically confirmed. The Rakshasa: Anytime the character lies with the true intent to deceive, he turns into a random animal for 1 hour. Lying with the intent to trigger this effect never works. The Sickness: The character becomes afflicted with incurable leprosy (or another disease of the GM's choice). While the disease cannot be cured by any effect short of a miracle or wish spell, the effects of the affliction can be negated through the use of spells like restoration. The Snakebite: Anyone who touches the character must succeed at a Fortitude save or be poisoned by greenblood oil. The save DC is equal to 10 + the character's Hit Dice + his Constitution modifier. This poison affects even those who touch the character to administer aid or healing magic. The Survivor: The next time the character is reduced to -10 hit points, he is instantly restored to full hit points. If he is killed by an effect that slays him without dealing hit point damage (such as by disintegrate), the effect fails to kill him and he is restored to full hit points. If he is killed by a hostile environment (such as a lava flow or when teleporting to a dangerous plane), he is transported to his last safe location and restored to full hit points. This card does not save the character from effects that would permanently disable him, like petrification. The Tangled Briar: Once per day, the character can communicate as per the spell speak with plants and have a plant truthfully answer any single question. Using this ability upsets the surrounding flora, however, causing 1d4+2 shambling mounds with the advanced template to erupt from the earth and attack the character, regardless of the surrounding terrain. The Teamster: When the character draws this card, a powerful being appears before the character and tasks him to undertake a dangerous quest. If the character proves resistant to undertaking the task, he is afflicted by geas/quest until the quest is completed. When the character completes the quest, the powerful being reappears, granting the character a lavish reward. The specifics of the quest, the powerful being's identity, and the character's reward are determined by the GM. The Theater: The next time the character defeats a creature, he is granted a +2 bonus to the same ability score as the creature's highest ability score. The Trumpet: This card grants the character the ability to summon an outsider of his alignment once per day. This outsider must be of a CR equal to or less than the character's level and serves for a number of rounds equal to the character's level. The Twin: The character physically becomes a member of the opposite gender. The Tyrant: The character gains the one-time ability to issue a single command to any creature in the multiverse and have the order obeyed. The target is affected as if by the spell dominate monster, and even orders for the target to kill itself are followed. Any creature targeted by this effect knows that it is acting against its will, and knows the identity and location of the character. Immortal creatures cannot effectively kill themselves, and the act only causes them considerable but fleeting pain. Additionally, creatures with the ability to grant such boons typically also possess the power to revoke them, and do so as soon as the command releases them. The GM ultimately decides what this command can accomplish. The character may use this card's effect whenever he wishes, but may only use it once. The Unicorn: This card grants the character the one-time ability to undo one past choice or regrettable action. The fabric of reality is unraveled and respun, potentially restoring creatures to life or altering the course of history, depending on how the character acted and how he wishes he would have acted. The player chooses what situation he would have acted differently in and the GM determines how reality changes to reflect that act. The change primarily affects the character, affecting others as little as possible. The character may use this card's effect whenever he wishes, but only once. The Uprising: Upon drawing this card, 3d6 unruly, accident-prone, 1st-level commoners appear to serve the character. If these followers are killed, the character takes the usual penalties on attracting further followers. Knowledge of these commoners' mistreatment or death spreads far, with the GM determining any repercussions. The Vision: The character receives two visions and the knowledge that one vision is true and the other false, though he does not know which is which. The GM determines the specifics of these visions. The visions may be views of the past, present, or future; cryptic omens; or total fantasies. The Wanderer: One of the character's mundane possessions becomes a magical item worth 20,000 gp or less. The GM determines which item manifests magical properties and what those properties are. The Waxworks: Upon drawing this card, 1d6 exact duplicates of the character appear within a 20-mile radius. These duplicates have the alignment opposite to that of the original character and oppose his goals. The Winged Serpent: The character is granted a single wish. This wish functions similarly to the spell wish when it comes to affecting rules and statistics, but can also change reality in ways outside the bounds of the spell's effects-such as rerouting a river or ending a war. The GM decides what the wish can and cannot accomplish."

				"In 4692 AR, soon after the start of the Fourth Crusade, a paladin of Iomedae and renowned demon slayer named Yaniel spoke out against the Mendevian crusaders, accusing them of negligence and sloth, and claiming these faults were what allowed Khorramzadeh to invade Kenabres and damage the wardstone. Her accusations cut too close to the truth, and in a moment of weakness her superiors threatened to excommunicate her. Instead, she said she would enter the Worldwound and fight the Fourth Crusade on her own, with only her magic sword Radiance for company. The church was happy to see Yaniel go, and in the 2 years that followed, she was thought to have been slain. Yet when she returned to Kenabres in 4694 AR, leading a small army of crusaders she'd rescued, both Yaniel and her superiors had changed. For her part, Yaniel had shed her pride and insubordination, and had gained a new appreciation for the difficult decisions leaders are forced to make. And the church leaders had learned that sometimes the truth is exactly what you need to hear. Alas, Yaniel was assassinated before the year was out, slain by the lilitu demon Minagho only a week into her second personal crusade. Her followers managed to return to Kenabres with Radiance, but Yaniel's body had been taken. The sword had gone dark after Yaniel's death, its magical powers apparently lost, and so the crusaders elected to place it in the Gray Garrison on display. Yet several months ago it was stolen by the Templars of the Ivory Labyrinth, who plan to soon send the sword north to Drezen for corruption into a weapon of evil.",

Certain events and tasks can awaken Radiance's latent powers, eventually transforming it into a full-fledged holy avenger-these events are noted in the following adventures in Wrath of the Righteous as they occur.",

In addition to the damage this weapon deals, any creature struck by the scepter ages a number of years equal to the damage taken. On a critical hit, not only does the scepter deal greater damage, but the victim ages 2 years for every point of damage taken. Creatures aged in this manner might have their physical ability scores reduced; consult Table 7-2 on page 169 of the Core Rulebook for the effects of aging on common humanoids. For the wide range of unlisted humanoids and non-humanoids this aging might affect, GMs should use their judgment, general knowledge, and creature descriptions to decide how the effects of aging apply on a race-byrace basis. GMs looking for a quick way to approximate the ages of minor opponents should alter Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution by -1 for every 10 years aged and consider +40 years to be a creature's maximum age. Any creature aged to greater than its maximum age immediately dies. Constructs, outsiders, and undead are immune to the effects of aging. The mental abilities of those affected by this form of aging do not increase. Creatures that gain abilities dependant on their age gain these abilities as normal (though, at the GM's discretion, these abilities might not be immediately usable).

This requires the bearer to make either a DC 30 Knowledge (history) check to program a precise date or a DC 30 Wisdom check to travel to a general period. The bearer can rush through calibrating the scepter, activating it in 1 minute, but doing so increases the associated DCs by +10. Regardless of whether or not this check is successful, a 5-foot-wide glowing tear in time opens within 15 feet. This rift cannot be used as a weapon or to destructive effect. What time the passage opens to is determined by whether the bearer succeeds at the check (opening a portal to the desired time) or fails (opening a portal to the incorrect time, determined by how significantly he failed, as shown on the Accidental Time Travel Results table on page 43). The time beyond the portal cannot be viewed and can only be discovered by passing completely through. The rift remains open for 1 minute before closing.

Xin created the Sihedron as more than just a symbol of his power over the schools of magic he'd defined for his nation, though. It was initially meant to be a badge of his power over all of Thassilon and a symbol of the unified nature of the nation's peoples. Each of the Sihedron's arms is made of a different skymetal, symbolizing how the nation of Thassilon was made of different races-Azlanti, Varisian, Shoanti, giant, elf, and others. Xin went further than merely making the Sihedron a symbol of harmony and diversity, though, and built into it significant advantages when the artifact is shared among a number of allies. The powers granted by the Sihedron are greatest when it is used not by a lone individual, but by a group that works together toward a common goal and whose members trust each other enough to effortlessly pass control of the powerful item between themselves swiftly and without a second thought.",

Even the artifact itself, built in the image of the sign of Lissala and the rune for the Thassilonian schools of magic, seems somewhat plain, lacking the distinctive hooklike shapes along the Sihedron rune's arms. Instead, these hooks are represented in the device by seven ioun stones embedded on the arms.",

Each point is opposed by two other points; the user can change which point is ascendant by concentrating as a standard action, but he cannot change the point to an opposing point.

As it does so, it unleashes a surge of potent magic that affects both creatures, granting a +2 insight bonus on saving throws for 1 round and restoring 2d8+10 points of damage for each creature. This transfer occurs so quickly that it can grant the bonus on a saving throw after the saving throw itself has been rolled, but the transfer must be made before the outcome of that roll is announced by the GM. Likewise, the healing granted can occur in the instant before a creature takes damage from any source, possibly healing a heavily wounded target before additional damage renders it unconscious or even kills it. When the Sihedron is granted to a new target in this manner, the new target can automatically select which point of the Sihedron is ascendant, even if that point is oppositional to the previously ascendant point.",

To ensure his vile soul's return, the runelord crafted a tome of leathered flesh, bound in bone, and inked in the blood of a thousand slaves. The Gluttonous Tome was Zutha's opus-the result of a decade's toil and his plan to rise from the ashes of Thassilon.",
				"",
				"Dividing his masterwork into three parts-each a potent artifact in its own right-the Runelord of Greed secreted the means of his resurrection away in three of his farthest-flung holdings, protected by the stewardship of his most devout servants. Thassilon's cataclysmic end disrupted Zutha's hopes of a swift return, though, as his minions deserted, died, or betrayed their master, resulting in the sections being scatted across Avistan. For millennia, the potent abjurations protecting its pages saved the parts of the Gluttonous Tome from destruction, with each having been lost and rediscovered countless times.

The only marring the book's pristine pages suffer is the addition of more necromancy spells penned in blood. The book contains every arcane necromancy spell of 1st to 7th level. Any necromancy spell prepared from the Codex is cast at +1 caster level. The book also absorbs necromantic energy, granting the bearer a +4 bonus on saves versus necromancy effects and immunity to energy draining effects of any kind (such as from enervation or a vampire's slam attack). Finally this section of the Gluttonous Tome includes a flesh golem manual that re-scribes itself one year after it's used.",

Anyone who reads the entire text of strange runic code (requiring 1 week of uninterrupted study and a DC 25 Decipher Script check) must make a DC 20 Will save, or gain a +2 inherent bonus to Intelligence and begin to take on traits of the undead (see below). Regardless of this save's result, the bearer acquires a deep understanding of necromancy, gaining a permanent +4 insight bonus on all Knowledge (arcana) and Spellcraft checks involving this school of magic. In addition, this section includes a flesh golem manual identical to the one in the Kardosian Codex.",

If the bearer channels energy (if he is a cleric for example) he now channels negative energy. Only a wish or miracle reverses this condition.",

				"The Black Book: This portion of the Gluttonous Tome consists of a charred flesh back-cover and 100 pages of smoked skin scrawled with blood runes in Zutha's erudite hand. Anyone reading the Black Book and keeping it on their person gains the ability to rebuke or command undead as a cleric of his total character level.

This light causes all living creatures within it to become nauseated for 1d6 rounds (no save). The sections mesh and meld, flesh knitting with flesh and bones grinding together. If two or more individuals control a portion of the tome when they fuse together, the one with the highest total character level gains control (determined randomly if there is a tie).

It corrupts everyone it touches, offering them great power over life and death, but at a secret price. Once the tome is fully rejoined, its bearer is slowly seduced and devoured by Zutha, the Runelord of Gluttony. The tome manifests an insidious, seductive intellect (see below), which it uses to tempt its bearer to feats of greater and greater depravity. Zutha's soul feeds on the necromantic power embraced by the bearer. Every month, the bearer must make a DC 30 Fortitude save or gain a +1 inherent bonus to Intelligence (this stacks with that bonus granted by the Bone Grimoire to a maximum gain up to Intelligence 26) and permanently lose 1 point of Constitution. This reduction in Constitution cannot be restored by mortal magic as long as the Tome is retained. Despite this wasting away, the bearer becomes addicted to the necromantic power the tome grants, and must make a DC 40 Will save to part with the book. Once the tome slays the bearer, Zutha gains complete control of the body, which soon transforms into the runelord's original, bloated, undead body, freeing him to wreak his evil upon Golarion once more.",

He used the jewel to summon the  city's rivers of molten gold directly from the Elemental Plane  of Earth and to create much of the wealth within the city. He  also placed a small portion of his intelligence inside the  jewel-not enough to make it an intelligent item, but just  enough for the jewel to act on Tar-Baphon's instincts.  Tar-Baphon enshrined the jewel in the heart of Xin-  Grafar, forever the linking it to the city. Should the jewel of  everlasting gold ever be taken beyond the boundaries of the  city, it simply disappears and returns to its perch at the city's  heart. Because he knew thieves would eventually gain access  to the city, Tar-Baphon also created a trap using the powers  of the jewel. Once the city is sealed, the jewel can sense  intruders entering the city. When a trespasser is detected,  Tar-Baphon's trap is activated and the city floods with  molten gold (see page 14). This is an automatic response  that cannot be stopped.",

The object retains its basic shape and appearance,  but it is now composed of solid gold.",

The  transformation lasts as long as the bearer likes, but she cannot  leave the confines of Xin-Grafar while in elemental  form. This ability allows the jewel's bearer to survive  the molten-gold floods.",
				"- Summon Wealth: Once per month, the jewel of  everlasting gold can summon vast sums of wealth from  the Elemental Plane of Earth, in whatever form the bearer  wishes. This ability can only create mundane sources of  wealth, such as art objects, coins, gems, or even rivers  of molten gold-it cannot be used to create items with  magical properties.",
				"",
				"Because the jewel of everlasting gold contains a portion  of Tar-Baphon's malign will, any wealth created with its  touch of gold ability or summoned with its summon  wealth ability cannot be removed from Xin-Grafar  except by Tar-Baphon himself. Like the jewel itself, any  such treasure taken outside of Xin-Grafar disappears  and reappears scattered throughout the city.",
				"",
				"In addition, anyone touching the jewel is contacted  by the fragmentary intelligence inside the gem and hears  disturbing whispers in her mind, urging the character to  claim the jewel and swear fealty to Tar-Baphon. From that  point on, the influence of the jewel is never far from that  character's mind. How this influences a PC is largely up to  the GM. Most good-aligned PCs will feel the influence as a  nagging doubt, a subtle desire to return to the treasure city  and take the jewel in hand again. Chaotic- or evil-aligned PCs  may feel much stronger desires-sometimes overwhelming  urges to return to the jewel no matter the consequences. These  whispering influences can only be completely dispelled by remove  curse or similar magic (requiring a DC 30 caster level check)."

				"Despite its best-known name, Vesper's Rapier is not necessarily a rapier. This weapon is a +3 keen speed sword, with the type of sword varying from wielder to wielder. Upon being taken up by a new owner, the weapon transforms into any type of sword of the wielder's choosing, mundane or exotic. From that point on, the weapon always transforms into that type of sword whenever it is held by that individual. While bearing Vesper's Rapier, the wielder gains a +4 bonus on Bluff and Diplomacy checks made to influence humanoids, and can use the rapier like a compass to point in the direction of the closest collection of gems, silver, or drinkable water as a standard action at will.",

				"The sword also grants the wielder the ability to either slip or tighten the bonds of the physical world, granting her the ability to cast dimension door, dimensional lock, or greater teleport. These powers have limits, though, as they can drain the sword's magical abilities for the day-dimensional lock and greater teleport can be used once per day and drain the sword immediately after their use; dimension door can be used at will, but drains the sword after 3 uses, though the wielder can continue to use dimension door even if the sword is drained (this is the only effect that functions even when the sword is drained). If the sword becomes drained, it loses all of its magical properties (aside from dimension door), including its +3 enhancement bonus, skill bonuses, and the keen and speed special abilities. All of these properties are restored every day at midnight."
