Decorative fleshgems cost 1 gp and are merely ornamental.

Implanting a set of fleshgem spikes takes 10 minutes, and the resulting shard takes about a week to grow to full size. Removing a fleshgem takes 1 minute; the person removing the gem must make a successful DC 15 Heal check to avoid dealing 1d4 points of damage to the oread.

Additionally, half-elves are keenly aware of the effort put into the leaves' growth and normally only sell the products of their labors to others of their kind. When the golden maple's delicate, five-pointed leaves finally take on their namesake's color, they can be cut, dried, and then ground into a fine powder, a process that requires a DC 15 Knowledge (nature) or Profession (herbalist) check. When used in conjunction with the Craft (alchemy) skill to create special substances and items like alchemical grease or tanglefoot bags, golden maple leaves reduce the Craft DC by 5 and add +1 to the DC of any save required by the alchemical item. A single dose of golden maple leaf powder is sufficient to augment the crafting of three alchemical items."

Another type has a much thinner cavity cut into its unusually thick cover.

A single dose of poison can be applied to an entire 2-pound bag of caltrops after 10 minutes of work. Doing so requires a delicate hand, and there is a 5% chance of poisoning yourself unless you have the poison use class feature or a similar ability.

Anyone who sees it from farther than 30 feet away must succeed at a DC 10 Perception check to realize it is not an actual snake. The key-wound rattler can neither see nor hear. If it runs into an unyielding surface, it bumps around until it feels an open path, rotating first to the right and then to the left before going back the way it came. If it bumps into anything that is neither hard nor still, it attacks with its bite (+5 attack, 1d3 nonlethal damage) until the obstacle moves away. While moving, a key-wound rattler's AC is 12 and it provokes attacks of opportunity as normal. At the end of the turn in which it winds down, it curls up as if to sleep. A key-wound rattler has hardness 10 and 10 hit points. It is not a creature, and does not threaten spaces or act except as described above."

			"Drow alchemists of House Tracinoa developed this mixture to function as a lure for mindless oozes. You can throw a flask of ooze attractant as a splash weapon. On a direct hit, each mindless ooze within 60 feet must succeed at a DC 12 Will save or be compelled to approach the target for the next 1d4+1 rounds. On a miss, an ooze still attempts a Will save, but on a failure it instead approaches the square in which the flask landed. Once an ooze moves adjacent to the targeted creature or into the targeted square, it resumes its normal behavior. An ooze can be affected by ooze attractant only once in a 24-hour period."

It can be used this way repeatedly. All weapons created with a piecemeal weapon have and cannot lose the broken condition. A piecemeal weapon can be used to create only a single weapon at a time, and it can't be enhanced to create magical weapons. A light weapon created with a piecemeal weapon grants a +4 bonus on Sleight of Hand checks to hide it on one's person."
